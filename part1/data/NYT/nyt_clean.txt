each week technology reporters and columnists from the new york times review the week xe news offering analysis and maybe joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry want this newsletter in your inbox sign up here
greetings from the real economy xe steve lohr tech reporter for the times and tend to focus on the effects of technology beyond silicon valley no question the valley is wellspring of innovation and home to the ascendant digital corporate giants both feared and admired but it xe just sliver of the trillion american economy
technology is only tool in service of greater ends and those ends presumably extend beyond creating billionaires and enriching investors the larger agenda in economic terms includes growth productivity living standards and jobs
let xe take one of those economic ingredients xe jobs
forecasts of technology xe impact on jobs run the spectrum from apocalyptic to sanguine depending largely on the pace of progress in artificial intelligence but there is consistency to the serious research on the coming course of automation in the near term occupations are more likely to be transformed by digital technology than destroyed by it
but decade or so out there will be big changes the mckinsey global institute estimates that up to third of the american work force will have to switch to new occupations by
the work of the future it seems clear is going to be digitally inflected software skills are increasingly essential to every field most tech workers no longer work in the tech industry and that trend is accelerating
the biggest challenge is finding pathways to good jobs in the modern economy for the two thirds of americans who do not have four year college degrees addressing that challenge is the focus of policymakers state and local governments some companies and several nonprofits like the markle foundation and opportunity work
these efforts are typically not far along yet but the ones that seem to work best are collaborations xe public private partnerships that also involve nonprofit organizations and educational institutions
new project adopting the collaborative model was announced this month in new haven the goal said gov dannel malloy is xe ccultivating the tech work force talent of tomorrow xe the new venture aims to double the number of software engineering graduates in connecticut over the next several years
its educational partner is college alternative start up the holberton school founded in in san francisco holberton offers two year program to create software engineers its graduates now work for companies like apple ibm dropbox and tesla the school charges no tuition but graduates who get jobs pay the school percent of their salaries for three years
after the connecticut announcement caught up with holberton xe founders julien barbier and sylvain kalache both alumni of silicon valley companies their school is designed around projects and peer learning with mentors but no formal teachers
technical skills are only part of the program writing white papers project reviews and public speaking are also emphasized critical thinking teamwork and learning to learn are the higher order skills
technology changes too fast mr barbier said for expertise in particular set of software tools to be lasting asset in the labor market
xe cin two years you do learn craft that is in demand xe said mr barbier holberton xe chief executive xe cbut this is really about self learning if you can train yourself you xe re never going to obsolete xe
in san francisco holberton has enrolled total of students since it opened its doors two years ago and with added space hopes to bring in students year before long at the new haven school which begins next year holberton plans to start with to students and then expand rapidly
its model has made encouraging progress but the big question for all the experiments intended to prepare people for the future of work is whether anything can scale up to the size of the challenge that america faces
some tech stories of note this week
xe xa facebook is setting up xe cwar room xe as the command center for the social network xe campaign to root out false news and fake accounts before the fall elections the executive who is leading the effort called it xe cprobably the biggest companywide reorientation since our shift from desktops to mobile phones xe
xe xa group of job seekers filed charges with the federal equal employment opportunity commission against facebook and nine employers their complaint claims the companies are using facebook xe ad targeting technology to exclude female candidates from seeing their job ads
xe xa in south texas silicon valley start ups are scrambling to supply technology for xe cvirtual xe border wall digital surveillance may be more effective and less costly than president trump xe beloved brick and mortar wall but the never blinking gaze of robotic sentinels on vast stretches of private property understandably raises privacy worries
xe xa the european union has begun an antitrust investigation of amazon xe practices in commerce the issue is whether amazon unfairly uses data collected about third party sellers to make its own decisions about products to sell giving it an anticompetitive edge
xe xa fascinating look at how fake news germinates and goes viral my colleague kevin roose dug into five bogus claims about christine blasey ford who has accused the supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh of sexual assault nugget of fact is wrapped in layers of conspiratorial imagining and then eagerly consumed by the like minded online

mary barra the chief executive of general motors said the company is xe con track xe to roll out ride sharing service in that would rely on autonomous vehicles development that would advance the already heated race to bring self driving car to market
xe cwe xe re on track with our rate of learning to be able to do that next year xe ms barra said at dealbook xe playing for the long term conference she added that the company had strategy to show how its vehicles are safer than human drivers the vehicles can currently run safely at speeds of up to about miles per hour and the service will be limited to small geographical area ms barra said
check out the latest from the dealbook conference
she did not say where the service would operate but noted that the company has been testing in san francisco
autonomous vehicles rely on what ms barra described as xe ca suite of sensors xe including radar cameras and technology known as lidar which uses near infrared light to detect the shape of objects around it is focused on advancements to lidar which will drive down costs and enable the vehicles to travel at higher speeds she said
after substantial investments this year from softbank group of japan and honda xe autonomous vehicle unit cruise is now valued at billion
ms barra also explained why pushed back last week against trump administration proposal to roll back obama era fuel economy standards the company instead called for national gas mileage standard that would mandate percentage of carmaker sales come from zero emissions vehicles
xe cwe do believe in an all electric future xe she said before warning that patchwork of state regulations would only slow down advancements
xe cthat xe inefficient and that xe going to direct costs to the consumer which will lead to slower adoption xe she said

from google to microsoft and now amazon the largest technology companies are increasingly seeing their workers protest their government projects
in recent years tech firms have built artificial intelligence and cloud computing systems that governments find attractive but as these companies take on lucrative contracts to furnish state and federal agencies with these technologies they xe re facing increasing pushback from their staffs
amazon employees have joined civil rights groups and investors in protesting the company xe sale of facial recognition technology to law enforcement agencies amazon began marketing facial recognition system called rekognition to law enforcement as means of identifying people suspected of committing crimes shortly after the tool was introduced in the system xe which analyzes images and videos and compares them with databases of photographs to pick out individuals xe has been used by the police department in orlando fla and the sheriff xe department in washington county ore
in letter addressed to the company xe chief executive jeff bezos that was published by the hill employees wrote
we refuse to contribute to tools that violate human rights as ethically concerned amazonians we demand choice in what we build and say in how it is used
the letter also criticized the data science company palantir xe use of amazon xe cloud computing systems to carry out work for immigration and customs enforcement
amazon declined to comment but pointed to blog post published on its website this month after the american civil liberties union called for amazon to ban the sale of rekognition to the police matt wood general manager of artificial intelligence at amazon web services wrote
we believe it is the wrong approach to impose ban on promising new technologies because they might be used by bad actors for nefarious purposes in the future the world would be very different place if we had restricted people from buying computers because it was possible to use that computer to do harm the same can be said of thousands of technologies upon which we all rely each day through responsible use the benefits have far outweighed the risks
earlier this week microsoft employees wrote letter to the company xe chief executive satya nadella protesting the software maker xe work with ice microsoft holds million contract with ice for project relating to data processing and artificial intelligence according to the verge the letter now has signatories
with government contracts so lucrative the question is whether the concerns of employees will push tech executives to action
early signs suggest they may xe at least to degree
the campaigns at amazon and microsoft echo one by google employees earlier this year workers there sought to halt an project that google was working on with the pentagon that used machine learning to improve the accuracy of drone missions
the protest was ultimately successful google said the contract with the defense department will not be renewed and created set of principles to guide its artificial intelligence projects the new guidelines prohibit the kinds of work that could cause injury or violate human rights they do not rule out all forms of defense work though

beijing xe when president xi jinping announced measures to further open up china xe auto industry to foreign carmakers the global industry initially cheered
now the cheering has stopped
as details are emerging foreign auto executives attending china xe annual auto show in beijing this week said mr xi xe initiative was too narrow and vague to change business on the ground that means the initiative may not be strong enough starting point for talks to stave off the trump administration xe threats to impose tariffs on billion in chinese made goods
central to mr xi xe plan is that it will allow foreign automakers to own chinese factories instead of working through chinese partner as is currently required but auto executives in beijing said they were comfortable with the current system
xe cit would be crazy to think you can do it all yourself in market that is so different xe said trevor worthington ford xe vice president for product development in asia and the pacific
president trump is sending to beijing late next week negotiating team that includes treasury secretary steven mnuchin and the united states trade representative robert lighthizer autos are one of the issues on the agenda the trump administration has accused beijing of forcing foreign companies to share or reveal their technology as price of doing business in china particularly in futuristic areas like electric cars
mr xi xe plan to further open up china xe auto market was seen as potential olive branch it calls for phasing out by the beijing government xe requirement that any foreign automaker that wants to make cars in china do so through joint venture with chinese car company for makers of electric cars the requirement would end this year he also said that china would reduce its percent tariff on imported cars without offering details
the plan could help companies setting up new factories especially upstarts like the electric vehicle company tesla motors which has big ambitions in the world xe largest market for new cars
but established carmakers like daimler volkswagen and ford said at the auto show on wednesday that they planned to keep their joint ventures the way they were the companies have already moved their production and auto parts supply chains to china and foreign auto companies have found making cars in china for local drivers quite profitable
xe cwe will maintain the structure as we have today xe said rupert stadler the chairman of audi the luxury arm of volkswagen of germany referring to audi xe two joint ventures in china he added xe cfor us it is very clear we will in the long run have two feet on the ground in china xe
at the same time executives said that some of their biggest trade concerns have not been addressed these include china xe insistence that electric cars have batteries that are made in china not imported local subsidies for electric vehicles which total as much as per car are available only for cars with batteries that were manufactured in china the subsidies have helped make china the world xe largest market by far for electric cars so carmakers have rushed to shift their supplier networks to china
xe cwe hope things may change xe said jochem heizmann the president and chief executive of volkswagen group china xe cat the end this limits competition this limits innovation xe
they also cited china xe ambitious program to use state support to build up world beating competitors in electric and self driving cars among other emerging technologies program called made in china
china also requires that electric cars be manufactured under brand names that are partly owned by chinese partners
peter fleet the president of ford motor xe asia and pacific operations said the company already planned to sell electric cars in china through joint venture under an inexpensive local brand that would not carry its famous blue oval logo still he said he thought the rule might be erased once china eliminates the requirement that electric cars also be produced by joint ventures in china
xe cthat xe some of the detail we xe ve yet to see xe he said

san francisco xe the department of energy disclosed details on monday of one of the most expensive computers being built million machine based on intel and cray technology that may become crucial in high stakes technology race between the united states and china
the supercomputer called aurora is retooling of development effort first announced in and is scheduled to be delivered to the argonne national laboratory near chicago in lab officials predict it will be the first american machine to reach milestone called xe cexascale xe performance surpassing quintillion calculations per second
that xe roughly seven times the speed rating of the most powerful system built to date or times faster than the first xe cpetascale xe systems that began arriving in backers hope the new machines will let researchers create significantly more accurate simulations of phenomena such as drug responses climate changes the inner workings of combustion engines and solar panels
supercomputers which play major role in tasks such as weapons design and code breaking have long been considered proxy for national competitiveness in science and technology the united states led the field for decades but china has become an aggressive rival
an ibm system called summit built for the oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee took back the no position last year on twice yearly ranking of the world xe most powerful systems xe spot held by china for five years but china leads by another key measure it accounted for systems on the top list compared with for the united states
aurora xe which is also designed to exploit new advances in the field of artificial intelligence including machine learning techniques pushed lately by the likes of google and facebook xe may not crack the new speed barrier first jack dongarra computer scientist at the university of tennessee who monitors global developments is tracking plans for three systems in china that are scheduled to be delivered in with exascale performance
in addition mr dongarra said the energy department is expected to follow aurora with exascale class systems at the oak ridge national laboratory and lawrence livermore national laboratory near san francisco
supercomputer speeds are not usually discussed much until machines run standard performance tests but the stakes associated with the shift to exascale systems and their enormous price tags have attracted outsize attention the energy secretary rick perry who took part in the event discussing aurora on monday announced plan last year to spend up to billion on two to three exascale systems
aurora which far exceeds the million price for summit represents record government contract for intel and test of its continued leadership in supercomputers the silicon valley giant xe popular processors xe the calculating engine for nearly all personal computers and server systems xe power most such machines but additional accelerator chips are considered essential to reach the very highest speeds and its rival nvidia has built sizable business adapting chips first used with video games for use in supercomputers
the version of aurora announced in was based on an intel accelerator chip that the company later discontinued revised plan to seek more ambitious performance targets was announced two years later
features discussed on monday include unreleased intel accelerator chips version of its standard xeon processor new memory and communications technology and design that packages chips on top of one another to save space and power
cray longtime supercomputer maker is providing system design called shasta as well as technology to speed the flow of data inside aurora said peter ungaro the company xe chief executive intel and cray are also supplying new software to make advanced supercomputers easier to program
xe cwe want to make exascale computing available to everyone xe said raja koduri senior vice president of intel xe core and visual computing group
rick stevens an associate laboratory director at argonne acknowledged that aurora represented gamble on collection of new technologies
xe cwe have to take risks in order to advance the state of the art xe he said xe cif you don xe do that you won xe be on the leading edge of technology xe

san francisco xe after dara khosrowshahi took over as uber xe chief executive last august he considered shutting the company xe money losing autonomous vehicle division visit to pittsburgh this spring changed that
in town for leadership summit mr khosrowshahi and other uber executives were briefed on the state of the company xe self driving vehicle research which is based in pittsburgh the group was impressed by the progress its autonomous division had made in testing driverless cars in pittsburgh and in arizona according to three people familiar with the ride hailing company who were not authorized to speak publicly they left the meeting energized convinced that uber needed to forge ahead with self driving cars the people said
but days after the summit one of uber xe autonomous cars struck and killed woman who was pushing bicycle across street in tempe ariz video from the march collision showed distracted safety driver failing to react in time as the vehicle barreled into the pedestrian elaine herzberg
the accident threw uber xe autonomous vehicle efforts into flux immediately forcing the suspension of its self driving car tests in cities including tempe pittsburgh and toronto months later uber xe executives are divided over what to do with the autonomous business according to the people familiar with the company while one camp is pushing mr khosrowshahi to seek partnerships or even potential sale of the unit known as the advanced technologies group rival contingent is arguing that developing self driving technology is crucial to uber xe future the people said
mr khosrowshahi remains undecided the people said though he has expressed desire to partner with other companies on autonomous technologies in recent months uber has started talking with few auto manufacturers about potential partnerships including supplying uber xe autonomous driving technology for use in toyota xe minivans according to one person familiar with the talks toyota declined to comment
the internal debates are unfolding at time when many companies can ill afford to pause on autonomous technology given stiff competition from carmakers and other tech companies in recent months top engineers have left uber xe self driving project for lucrative opportunities elsewhere uber xe self driving cars recently returned to the road in pittsburgh but with human drivers at the wheel meaning employees are driving around like any other motorist xe except their vehicles are carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars in technology
the issue of whether to retain or sell is complicated by uber xe stated intention to go public by the end of the company valued at billion has racked up billions of dollars in losses since it was founded in and needs to persuade investors that it can eventually create sustainably profitable business the self driving efforts which have been losing million to million quarter do little to help that case and mr khosrowshahi has been shedding money losing businesses since he joined uber
at meeting in pittsburgh on aug according to person briefed on the event mr khosrowshahi did not address what he would do with the self driving efforts but told employees there that it xe cis big time hardware manufacturing software problem at scale lots of tech companies out there are going after this problem but think there are very few companies who are taking this on end to end at scale the way we are xe
in statement uber said xe cright now the entire team is focused on safely and responsibly returning to the road in autonomous mode that xe our no objective and we have every confidence in the work they are doing to get us there xe
uber first made its interest in self driving cars public when it hired about researchers and scientists from the national robotics engineering center at carnegie mellon university in at the time the company xe chief executive was one of the founders of uber travis kalanick who had decided to bet big on self driving vehicles he wanted to prepare uber for future when fleets of driverless cars could move passengers efficiently and safely around the clock
in uber acquired otto self driving truck start up whose founders had decamped from google the deal later spurred trade secrets theft lawsuit from google xe onetime self driving car unit waymo the case briefly went to trial this year generating headlines and embarrassing revelations before uber settled with waymo in february
in its rush to get on the road with driverless cars uber also ran afoul of regulators the company started testing its autonomous vehicles in san francisco in without permit from california xe division of motor vehicles the state agency ordered uber to apply for permit but the company refused saying permits were not necessary since safety drivers were monitoring the cars the ultimately revoked the registrations for the self driving cars that uber was testing in the city
by early this year uber xe self driving division was preparing to ramp up development pushing its testing cars in arizona to tally more miles the goal according to internal documents reviewed by the new york times was for uber to win regulatory approval to start testing self driving car service in arizona before the end of this year
but the crash in march xe the first known fatality involving pedestrian and an autonomous car xe altered everything since then uber has steadily narrowed the scope of its autonomous vehicle operations
in may uber announced that it was shutting its driverless testing hub in arizona and laying off employees day later preliminary findings from federal regulators investigating the crash confirmed what many self driving car experts suspected uber xe self driving car should have detected pedestrian with enough time to stop but it failed to do so uber has begun safety review and plans to publish its assessment in the coming months
mr khosrowshahi has started to subtly de emphasize the company xe role in developing driverless technology
at conference last year he said it was xe chuge advantage xe for uber to have its own autonomous technology while operating global ride sharing network but this may mr khosrowshahi said that while uber needed to have access to autonomous technology it aimed to be xe cneutral xe he said uber would be open to licensing its own technology or building around alternatives from other companies xe stark contrast to the company xe previous approach of owning and operating the entire self driving xe cstack xe of technology and hardware
and in july uber announced that it was closing its autonomous trucking business the company instead said it would focus exclusively on building self driving cars
xe cfor now we need the focus of one team with one clear objective xe eric meyhofer who leads uber xe driverless car efforts wrote in an email to employees
in the preceding months some senior engineers and executives with expertise in self driving vehicles had already left one of those was don burnette one of otto xe founders who became the chief executive of new self driving company called kodiak which focuses on long haul trucking
xe ci really wanted to focus on the trucking problem and there was not as much focus on that at uber xe mr burnette said
he added that uber would most likely continue to pursue its vision of driverless cars because it and other companies xe chave been working on it for so long promising this for so long and they have tremendous amount of money behind them xe

los angeles xe can concert hall dream the los angeles philharmonic has lot riding on the answer
on sept with big ticket donors watching expectantly from parking lot across the street refik anadol turkish american artist plans to transform the billowing steel superstructure of the orchestra xe walt disney concert hall into swirling phantasmagorical collage
the minute performance will be fashioned from artifacts from the philharmonic xe own history millions of photographs printed programs and audio and video recordings each one digitized microcrunched and algorithmically activated to play in abstract form across the building xe dynamic metal surface if all goes according to plan xe cwdch dreams xe as the production is known will kick off the philharmonic xe centennial season with the kind of brio that befits the company that zachary wolfe described last year in the new york times as xe cthe most important orchestra in america period xe
mr anadol bubbly and rather cherubic looking year old who dresses entirely in black likes to imagine the building which was designed by frank gehry as an enormous artificial intelligence one that recalls the orchestra xe past and slips into reverie about its future few weeks ago armed with animations and storyboards he showed up at the philharmonic xe administrative offices in an elegant but understated building next to the concert hall to detail his progress
gathered in small conference room were kenric mcdowell an artificial intelligence expert from google and several philharmonic officials chief among them chad smith the orchestra xe chief operating officer and de facto head of programming man whose preppy demeanor belies reputation as one of the most innovative figures in classical music
the building xe xe cperformance xe staged for patrons paying upward of per person for the opening night gala and free to all on the nine evenings after that falls into three parts first xe ccentennial memories xe when data from the philharmonic xe history xe terabytes of it mr anadol reported xe is projected onto the building xe skin
mr smith broke in xe the last time we were together it was seven terabytes xe
that was while ago mr anadol reminded him the audio recordings alone xe nearly of them xe now come to seven terabytes
xe cthat xe an average of two recordings day xe mr smith observed doing quick calculation based on the years the orchestra has been playing the actual centennial won xe come until september xe cinteresting xe
next comes xe cconsciousness xe when the building processes the billions of data points it has received to form vast web of connections every performance of every symphony every trumpet every oboe every note the orchestra has ever played and finally xe cdream xe when the concert hall fuses all this together to generate sort of combinatorial fantasia xe to xe challucinate xe as mr anadol put it
xe cthis xe he declared xe cwill be very divine moment xe
and one long in coming it took years for the concert hall to be built after lillian disney walt xe widow donated million for its construction and it has taken another years after its completion in to realize the architect xe vision for its exterior
xe ci have always had the dream that images and videos would be projected onto the walt disney concert hall xe mr gehry said in an email xe cduring the design process selected the metal for the express purpose of taking projection xe happy that the phil is going to do it now for its anniversary xe
technically speaking of course the walt disney concert hall will no more be dreaming than the xe cmona lisa xe follows you with her eyes but that xe not the point
xe ci thought it was time to take these beautiful memories and organize them into story xe mr anadol said later as we sat in his studio former auto repair shop just down the street from the site of the disney complex where mickey mouse was created in
where car mechanics once labored half dozen designers in their now work behind enormous computer screens xe cit xe kind of science fiction story xe he added xe cwe have concern about the future because that xe where we all live xe xe so when the building xe cdreams xe in his story it xe using information from the past to project itself into the future
mr anadol is data artist although his use of luminescence recalls such california light and space artists as james turrell he xe less influenced by other artists than by architects xe mr gehry among them for xe chow he defines the future xe mr anadol said xe and by people like alan turing the pioneering computer scientist
one of mr anadol xe signature works is xe cwind of boston data paintings xe by foot video display in the lobby of boston office building that uses wind readings to create an ever changing set of images that rise and fall like waves another installation went on view in july at the charlotte airport xe cinterconnected xe video representation of everything that xe transpired at the airport over the previous days xe every flight arrival every departure every car pulling up every passenger boarding
the memories that inform xe cwdch dreams xe are usually locked away in square foot corner in the los angeles county hall of records nearby high rise but even as the show mines the orchestra xe past xe cwdch dreams xe speaks to current issues in computing it uses some of the same artificial intelligence algorithms that underlie facial recognition which has become increasingly controversial as its potential for abuse becomes clearer and mr anadol xe idea that building can think and dream is fanciful version of the so called internet of things the fast growing network of xe csmart xe objects xe home appliances thermostats cars what have you xe that are being given sliver of intelligence with little thought for how to secure them against digital intruders
the project also loops back to popular culture xe in particular to the films of christopher nolan who in movies like xe cmemento xe and xe cinception xe displays narrative sleight of hand that transforms everyday experiences like dreaming and remembering into the stuff of wonder and suspense key methodology behind xe cwdch dreams xe machine learning technique that originated in google lab in switzerland has even been called xe cinceptionism xe after the movie that starred leonardo dicaprio as corporate spy who sets out to manipulate his target xe dreams
mr anadol had made the idea of activating the walt disney concert hall xe exterior the subject of his master xe of fine arts thesis at the university of california los angeles xe and that in turn brought him to the attention of mr smith and led to his first commission for the philharmonic creating video installation that transformed the interior of the hall into virtual tapestry during performance of edgard var xc xa se xe xe cam xc xa riques xe
but that like his thesis project involved the relatively simple idea of the concert hall xe reacting to the sounds being made in it for the building to xe cdream xe the computer code that controlled the display would need some understanding of what it was dreaming about he needed to go deeper xe which is where google and inceptionism came in
mr anadol first connected with the google team at symposium at san francisco art gallery later that year he was offered residency at google xe artists and machine intelligence program nascent effort to bring artists and engineers together to ponder big questions like the nature of intelligence and the relationship between humans and machines
by this point mr smith and other leaders of the philharmonic xe including its celebrity conductor gustavo dudamel and its chief executive at the time deborah borda who left last fall to become of the troubled new york philharmonic xe were already planning its centennial season
they laid out an ambitious agenda including million fund raising campaign street festival running the eight miles from the downtown concert hall to the hollywood bowl and the commissioning of new works for the coming season by such composers as john adams philip glass andrew norman and steve reich when the idea of fulfilling mr gehry xe long expressed desire to use the outside of the concert hall as canvas came up mr anadol was the obvious candidate to make it happen
with google supplying machine learning experts and cloud computing resources mr anadol and his team set to work to make their computer system dream they used different types of neural networks xe the computing technology that underlies most artificial intelligence efforts today xe to process pictures and text from the orchestra xe archives and generate new imagery that xe based on them and to fashion sound collage from decades of the orchestra xe recordings it xe about xe cthe idea of the machine as collaborator xe mr anadol explained
xe cwdch dreams xe is benign work an unalloyed vision of artificial intelligence as partner rather than threat the future it posits would not be out of place in disneyland mr anadol is aware that there are less wholesome currents xe that the same technology that processes millions of historical images from the philharmonic xe archives could be used for instance to monitor populations on vast scale
and yet xe ci am very very optimistic xe he said xe ci think these are incredible tools to have for creativity xe so it xe that aspect that will be on display on sept as mr anadol put it xe cfrank gehry xe building is now having its xe inception xe moment xe

mountain view calif xe google xe annual conference for software developers is usually celebration of technology an event that highlights how tech advancements xe no matter how mundane xe are good for the world
but in year when some of its most popular products have been used to propagate misinformation spread conspiracy theories and meddle with elections google struck more measured tone on tuesday speaking at this year xe google conference sundar pichai the company xe chief executive said advancements in artificial intelligence had pushed google to be more reflective about its responsibilities
xe cthere are very real and important questions being raised about the impact of these advances and the role they will play in our lives xe mr pichai said during his keynote speech xe cwe know the path ahead needs to be navigated carefully and deliberately we feel deep sense of responsibility to get this right xe
mr pichai was acknowledging the backlash facing silicon valley google has come under fire for its far reaching data collection practices its inability to tackle the deluge of problematic videos on youtube and its occasional failures in keeping misinformation away from search results in the minutes after tragic events
google did not dwell on those headaches however in front of an enthusiastic crowd at an outdoor amphitheater near its mountain view headquarters the internet giant fell back on familiar message artificial intelligence will change the world
mr pichai said artificial intelligence had uncovered breakthroughs in health care that humans would not have spotted an artificial intelligence program running on google xe so called machine learning software that helps diagnose eye disease from retina image found that the same photo could be used to identify cardiovascular risk
it is the type of meaningful breakthrough that google executives love to promote but it has little to do with google xe core web products or the way it makes money but even those services are getting an artificially intelligent makeover
the company demonstrated how its google assistant computer software is now capable of calling person at hair salon or restaurant to make reservation google said artificial intelligence had allowed the computer xe voice to sound more human xe complete with xe cuhs xe and natural pauses as well as logical follow up questions xe so the person at the other end does not know that he or she is speaking to computer
improvements in have allowed google xe computer assistant to have different voices and accents including the ability later this year to have the singer john legend tell you the day xe weather
the company also demonstrated new artificially intelligent feature in gmail called smart compose that starts to suggest complete sentences in email as you type google said this would help users complete emails more quickly with fewer spelling and grammar mistakes it plans to add this feature over the next few weeks
but one of its most significant breakthroughs will never be seen by consumers
google said it would roll out new processing chip to power many of its machine learning programs programs require great deal of computing power and custom made chips housed inside data centers to handle this data crunch have fueled an arms race among the tech industry xe biggest companies google said its new chip would be eight times more powerful than the chip it introduced last year
mark hung research vice president at the research firm gartner said the conference demonstrated how much google relied on to make its products stand out
xe calmost everything google is announcing now is related xe he said xe cgoogle has lead on artificial intelligence over many of its competitors and it xe going to use that as weapon to advance their products forward xe
in keeping with theme of more responsible google the company also introduced features aimed at addressing how technology is burrowing deeper into our lives xe sometimes in negative ways
google unveiled series of xe cdigital well being xe updates in the next version of its android smartphone software they include timer that allows person to limit time spent on certain apps each day and do not disturb feature that silences phone calls and notifications and that can be turned on by placing the smartphone screen face down on table
the company is also trying to encourage good manners with its google assistant the new xe cpretty please xe feature which encourages children to use xe cplease xe when asking for assistance aims to address the concern that children are learning to speak impolitely because they are talking to more digital assistants

san francisco xe uber and waymo the self driving car unit of google xe parent company alphabet used to be like brothers google invested in uber the internet giant xe top lawyer even served on uber xe board of directors
but that xe cbig brother little brother xe relationship deteriorated into paranoia as both companies pursued the creation of autonomous vehicles travis kalanick uber xe former chief executive said on wednesday
in the second full day of testimony in federal trial that could last month mr kalanick said the ride hailing service xe acquisition of otto start up founded by former google engineer had been spurred in part by concern that the search giant would create rival robot powered service
waymo which filed the lawsuit that is being heard contends that uber xe purchase of otto in august was part of plot to collude with former google engineers to steal the company xe trade secrets
the dissolution of uber xe relationship with google demonstrates the finicky nature of the ties that bind xe or break xe tech conglomerates and promising start ups
it xe something google understands well years ago google was tightly aligned with apple but the relationship soured as google started developing smartphone software steve jobs who was apple xe chief executive rightly believed that google xe android would become competitive threat to the iphone
when google initially invested in uber in larry page google xe chief executive at the time and david drummond alphabet xe top lawyer were mentors mr kalanick said alphabet remains an investor in uber
the two companies he said had xe clittle brother big brother xe dynamic because uber was xe ctrying to get more of their time than they were willing to give xe
after mr page repeatedly spurned meetings to discuss combining uber xe ride hailing service with google xe work on self driving vehicles in some sort of partnership mr kalanick said his company started to develop its own autonomous car technology
uber hired team of robotics experts from carnegie mellon university deepening the division between the two companies
xe cgenerally google was super not happy unpumped about us doing this xe said mr kalanick who stepped down as uber xe chief executive in june he recalled that mr page had been xe cangsty xe and asked him xe cwhy are you doing my thing xe
but mr kalanick said the engineers from carnegie mellon were not enough to catch up to google xe self driving car project which would become waymo so uber started talking to the otto founder anthony levandowski who was still working at google about helping uber develop its laser sensor technology xe an essential component for self driving cars
as mr kalanick and mr levandowski discussed ways to work together they exchanged hundreds of text messages the messages were presented in court on wednesday and were mostly variation on how important it was to win the race for self driving cars
mr levandowski told mr kalanick that xe csecond place is first xe loser mr kalanick said this wasn xe the first time he had heard this it was something his high school football coach had said
mr kalanick said he did not recall however what he had meant by some of the text messages he sent to mr levandowski including one that read xe cburn the village xe
in another exchange mr levandowski sent mr kalanick link to scene from the movie xe cwall street xe in which gordon gekko played by michael douglas argues xe cgreed for the lack of better word is good xe
when asked whether he had watched the scene mr kalanick said he thought so his emoji response was hint xe ci mean there is winky face there xe he said
once uber and otto struck basic agreement for an acquisition in april months before the deal was announced mr kalanick told uber executives in meeting that xe cgolden time is over xe it xe now wartime xe at another meeting he discussed how it was necessary for uber to find and use xe ccheat codes xe
mr kalanick explained that this phrase was not as nefarious as it sounded cheat codes xe care elegant solutions to problems that haven xe been thought of xe he said tesla for example has customers pay tens of thousands for cars but loads those vehicles with sensors that provide data to support its self driving car efforts
mr kalanick said he had another testy conversation with mr page in october after uber announced its acquisition of otto interestingly mr page was worried that uber was developing its own flying car technology
mr page has personally invested in flying car technology although it is not clear whether alphabet is working on it
mr kalanick insisted that uber wasn xe working on flying cars but he said mr page was mad that uber was hiring google employees and taking its intellectual property to which mr kalanick said he responded xe cyour people are not your ip xe
ip is an abbreviation for intellectual property
as uber xe lawyers questioned him mr kalanick recalled how he had had so much fun as the company xe chief executive he liked xe cbeing in the trenches xe with small teams but when asked about the otto acquisition and the hiring of mr levandowski mr kalanick was understated
xe cit xe not as great as we had thought at the beginning xe he said

san francisco xe apple once had grand aspirations to build its own electric self driving car and lead the next generation of transportation over time the tech giant xe ambitions ran into reality
so apple curtailed its original vision first by focusing on software for self driving cars and then by working solely on an autonomous shuttle for its own use with employees now the tech giant has settled for an auto partner that was not its first choice
in recent years apple sought partnerships with the luxury carmakers bmw and mercedes benz to develop an all electric self driving vehicle according to five people familiar with the negotiations who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly but on again off again talks with those companies have ended after each rebuffed apple xe requirements to hand over control of the data and design some of the people said
instead apple has signed deal with volkswagen to turn some of the carmaker xe new transporter vans into apple xe self driving shuttles for employees xe project that is behind schedule and consuming nearly all of the apple car team xe attention said three people familiar with the project
apple xe deal with volkswagen which has not been previously reported and the failure of its talks with other automakers reflect the continuing travails and diminished scope of the company xe four year old car program
the project has suffered from repeated changes in direction that have hurt morale and led to hundreds of departures from its peak of more than members two years ago five former apple employees said they added that the project lacked clear plan beyond the vans including any near term commercial goals
the fits and starts have most likely put apple even further behind in the race toward the self driving future waymo the self driving business spun out of google as well as start ups and some carmakers have been testing various autonomous vehicles on public roads for years some of the programs have hit hurdles xe uber on wednesday said it was shutting down its self driving operations in arizona and laying off about employees in the area xe but many have already gathered extensive data on autonomous driving patterns to improve their technology
apple declined to comment
apple originally began its car project xe known internally as titan and xe in at the time apple planned to build single vehicle that would upend society and industry in what would be the automotive version of the iphone the company set to work on an electric driverless car with lush interior reminiscent of lounge or living room where passengers face one another instead of the road according to two early employees of the project
apple enlisted software programmers automotive engineers rocket scientists and the industrial design team of apple xe design chief jonathan ive to reimagine the car they entertained series of unconventional concepts including augmented reality or holographic displays embedded in windshields and windows sunroof made of special polymer that reduces heat from the sun and windows with adjustable tints xe like those on boeing xe new dreamliner jets
two former apple employees also recalled how their colleagues built model of sport utility vehicle with four seats facing one another which some employees tested by sitting inside similar to design mercedes advertised in
as recently as apple planned to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build research and development labs around its cupertino calif campus including machine shop and labs for electric car batteries according to interviews and documents about the plans viewed by the new york times
members of the car project soon found that even designing and building fundamental parts of new car was not simple apple initially intended to build the car in house with preliminary discussions of an apple automotive plant in the south of the united states two former employees said but those plans quickly shifted to finding manufacturing partner to build xe but not design xe the cars
two former employees said apple xe requests of partners gradually evolved at first the company asked for help building an apple designed vehicle then it began asking potential partners to provide foundational car pieces like the chassis and wheels eventually apple requested that potential partners retrofit their own vehicles with apple xe sensors and software
in late apple bought two lexus and hired virginia firm called torc robotics to retrofit the vehicles with sensors project known internally as baja one former employee said the fleet has grown and california regulators have authorized apple to use such to run self driving tests on public roads the most of any company in the state after general motors xe but still fewer than waymo has across six states
but apple did not partner with lexus and it has long sought formal partner the company first worked with magna steyr canadian austrian contract manufacturer that has produced low volume vehicles for other automakers like the mercedes wagen according to two former employees few dozen magna steyr employees joined apple xe car team in california but gradually left after the partnership ended
bmw was long apple xe top choice given its focus on high end but mainstream products former employees said many apple executives including the company xe chief executive timothy cook also drive bmws mr cook visited bmw as early as to discuss partnership and those on and off negotiations continued for years but person close to the talks said any deal now appeared dead because both apple and bmw wanted to own the customer experience and relationship
apple xe other favored choice was mercedes benz internally code named bruce according to one former employee the two companies held partnership talks for more than year said three people familiar with the discussions but those negotiations were halted because of similar disagreements over control of the experience and data said one person close to the talks
apple also met with nissan in japan byd auto in china and sports car maker mclaren in britain among other companies one former employee said none of the talks resulted in deal because either the automaker was reluctant to give up control to apple or apple was holding out for more attractive partner
late last year apple found that partner in volkswagen buffeted by scandal around cheating emissions tests xe and lagging some rivals in development of self driving cars xe volkswagen jumped at the chance to work with apple former apple employees said volkswagen xe code name at apple is jetstream one of them said
now at lab near turin italy run by volkswagen subsidiary called italdesign the companies plan to remake volkswagen xe vans as electric self driving shuttles these people said
the frame wheels and chassis of the vans will remain but apple is replacing many components including the dashboard and seats said two people familiar with the project apple is also adding other computers sensors and large electric car battery they said the shuttles will ferry employees between two of apple xe silicon valley campuses and will include driver behind the wheel to take control if needed as well as an operator in the passenger xe seat tracking the van xe performance
executives leading apple xe car project had told mr cook that the shuttle would be completed by the end of but that deadline will be missed one former employee said it is unclear whether apple xe partnership with volkswagen will extend beyond the shuttle

machines are starting to take the place of the people who flip burgers drive across town and lately manage stock portfolios
artificial intelligence is taking on bigger role in making investment decisions
including an ability to analyze data and actually learn from it is considered useful in executing certain investing models such as high frequency trading and in helping fund managers with tasks that rely on gathering and interpreting reams of information going step further an exchange traded fund introduced in october uses algorithms to choose long term stock holdings
it is to early to say whether the powered equity will be trendsetter or merely curiosity artificial intelligence continues to become more sophisticated and complex but so do the markets that leaves technology and investment authorities debating the role of in managing portfolios some say it will only ever be tool valuable but subordinate to its flesh and blood masters while others envision it taking control and making decisions for many funds
xe cwe are just beginning to see rise of the machines in investment management xe said campbell harvey professor of finance at duke university although he said xe cit xe hard to define what the markets will look like xe if human judgment is usurped he predicted that xe cin the end it will be good thing for investors xe
artificial intelligence is term that may be spoken more than understood many investment firms use software to sift through data and perform rudimentary analysis by following fairly simple rules the programs can create portfolios by screening universes of stocks to select ones that meet criteria related to corporate results valuation metrics or trading patterns or by tweaking the proportions of the constituent companies in an index based on certain factors
those programs may be useful but they are not because they are static they do the same thing over and over until someone changes them involves machine learning in which program updates itself as new information comes in whatever goal the program was created to achieve remains the same but the problem solving tools it uses keep changing and reflect the sum of the information it has to work with
large fund management companies like fidelity and vanguard say they use for range of purposes but they decline to be specific
blackrock says it relies on it for heavy cognitive lifting often by scouring data to tease out patterns that might remain obscure to human eyes and brains examples offered by jessica greaney company spokeswoman include identifying and trying to exploit nonintuitive relationships between securities or market indicators perusing social media xe cto gain insights on employee attitudes sentiment and preferences xe and monitoring search engines for words being entered on particular topics say cars or luxury goods
these algorithms play supporting role in blackrock xe investing ms greaney said decisions on what to buy and sell are made by living breathing managers
the powered equity is different it uses algorithms to go the last mile and select its holdings usually to stocks said art amador one of the founders of equbot the company that created the fund he had the assistance of an program that fosters technology start ups and the runs most of its calculations on xe watson supercomputer
xe cequbot xe tech mimics the investment process of an army of equity research analysts working around the clock xe mr amador said xe cit has data on companies one million articles and filings day and data on market sentiment xe beyond sorting through that information and using its programming to ensure it has what it considers the optimal portfolio xe the fund typically makes at least one trade every day xe it constantly fine tunes its stock picking methods
mr amador says that artificial intelligence has an edge over the natural kind because of the inherent emotional and psychological weaknesses that encumber human reasoning
xe cwhen it comes to traditional portfolio management managers are going to talk to analysts and sector specialists but these people have biases and incentives xe he said xe cthe algorithm doesn xe have them xe
what it also doesn xe have is superior track record between oct when it began trading and the end of the year the rose percent compared with percent gain for the standard amp poor xe stock index
mr amador attributed the underperformance to normal variability in returns the fund xe programming beat the market when tested against historical data he said and he expects the same in real life as time passes
others aren xe so sure how effective will be when put in charge of otherwise ordinary funds robert arnott chairman of the investment firm research affiliates noted that can process immense amounts of data the flip side is that it needs immense amounts of data for the algorithms to learn
certain activities like high frequency trading process market information tick by tick and seek to profit from making numerous trades and holding positions for matters of hours or minutes compared with conventional investing this sort of trading gives programs more data mr arnott said but it is limited in scope to patterns related to stock price movements not the broader economic and commercial landscape
when it comes to managing long term portfolios however there are too many moving parts in financial markets for to get its mechanical head around in his view and too many humans with flaws motivations and unpredictable behavior doing the moving he says the markets are far more complex than the games like chess and backgammon that algorithms have mastered
tim clift chief investment strategist at envestnet pmc firm that helps build portfolios said that while artificial intelligence can give managers an edge it is xe ca little gimmicky at this point xe
xe cwe know the markets are irrational especially in the short term xe he said xe cbut the machines aren xe going to know how to behave in that kind of environment xe
gregg fisher portfolio manager at the gerstein fisher funds cautioned that programs could be stumped by off the wall and out of the blue developments that have no obvious analogues in their databases
they learn xe cby studying past patterns that they expect to continue xe he said referring to the events that precipitated the global financial crisis he wondered xe chow would have observed and planned for that the quantity of different things that can happen is seemingly unlimited xe
but for advocates of like mr harvey at duke the ability to gather data and put it to good use also seems to be unlimited he expects great strides in machine learning in the decades to come allowing to assume major role in how funds are managed and by whom
xe clarger firms will be providing information to managers that other firms have no chance of getting xe because they can xe afford the necessary data management systems he said the result will be xe to investment management superpowers that can harvest all that data xe
maybe so but some investment professionals prefer to give the final say to portfolio managers who were born not made
xe ci xe fan of automating everything possible but having human being push the last button is still good thing xe mr fisher said xe chopefully we all get better and better and smarter and smarter but there xe something comforting about having an informed human being with sound judgment at the end of the process xe

san francisco xe one of the founders of otto self driving truck company founded by former google employees and acquired by uber has left the ride hailing service
lior ron xe who along with anthony levandowski sold otto to uber in six months after leaving google xe was in charge of uber freight truck shipment booking service most of uber freight xe business does not involve the company xe autonomous trucks
the departure followed fatal crash involving an uber self driving car in tempe ariz the police said the car driving in autonomous mode had failed to slow down before it struck and killed woman who was walking her bicycle across street
uber has stopped testing of its autonomous vehicles in arizona california pittsburgh and toronto while investigators look into the accident week after uber halted testing arizona xe governor ordered the company xe self driving cars off state roads uber also pulled an application to renew its permit for testing autonomous vehicles in california
cnbc reported mr ron xe departure earlier on wednesday
an uber spokesman matt kallman said the departure was unrelated to the tempe crash but he would not elaborate on why mr ron had left or on the timing
uber executives have said self driving car technology is key to the company xe future but the effort had become headache long before the crash in arizona
the company xe cars were struggling to meet internal development expectations and falling way behind the improvements made by competitors
otto became the centerpiece of an intellectual property lawsuit between uber and waymo the self driving car business spun out of google waymo had accused uber of conspiring with mr levandowski to steal important technology plans
mr ron who is not an engineer but has background in business development was prominent figure in the lawsuit his name came up repeatedly in evidence presented by waymo to support its case that mr levandowski xe one of the engineers who helped start google xe driverless car project xe stole trade secrets
uber fired mr levandowski in may when he refused to cooperate with its case against waymo uber and waymo settled the case last month
while uber xe autonomous vehicle testing has been stopped at least temporarily waymo is embarking on an ambitious expansion of its operation the company said it would buy up to electric cars from jaguar land rover for its driverless ride service

re xe yes those calls you xe re ignoring are increasing xe front page may
while robocalls from scammers may be growing in volume politicians have dirty little secret they are exempted from the robocall laws they wrote
every year politicians hold hearings and act concerned about scams while secretly doing absolutely nothing to stop the barrage of electioneering via robocall in fact the only thing that brings republican and democratic voters together may be equal disgust for political robocalls
until politicians follow the same laws everyone else does few will take their concern as anything more than public relations spin
shaun dakin falls church va
the writer is the founder of the national political do not call registry
to the editor
this article hit the nail on the head in describing the robocalling problem but it can be readily solved without regulator or consumer involvement the telecom companies can stop these attacks by using machine learning tools to figure out good guys versus bad guys while ensuring that legitimate calls such as snow day notifications go through that would eliminate percent of the problem
with little ingenuity and determination robocalls will become the junk email of the future xe something that everyone vividly remembers getting but that now barely exists outside of our spam folders
eyal rosenthal tel aviv
the writer is director of business development for starhome mach company that offers fraud prevention for telecom companies
to the editor
this article notes that millions of robocalls are being made because they xe re so inexpensive phone companies should be required to charge for phone calls as they did as recently years ago if the entities making these invasive calls had to pay one cent or more per call they would think twice about making million calls
citizens and small businesses could be protected from such charges by allowing say or even free calls per month but then each additional call would cost or cents
half the money collected would go to the phone providers and the other half to the government to reduce the national debt everyone wins except the bad guys

interview by dan amira
you just released the th season of xe ccomedians in cars getting coffee xe how come it xe illegal to talk on phone while you xe re driving but it xe legal to film tv show believe me it xe hundred times more distracting to try to drive an old stick shift car and interview somebody at the same time than it is to be on the phone definitely distracted driving
you have huge collection of classic cars not to get too morbid but have you thought about what will happen to it after you xe re gone sure my wife xe going to liquidate it and that xe fine with me want people like me to enjoy them it should be like blowing on dandelion
we xe re headed toward an age of self xe bdriving cars assume you xe re not looking forward to that no that would be like computer written comedy
which is thing they xe re trying to do have you heard about that xe ve heard some of the jokes and they xe re not that bad
it recently occurred to me that lot of xe cseinfeld xe plotlines were car related parking garages parallel parking handicap spots traffic mechanics license plates rental cars car dealerships running over pigeons valet airport pickups was xe cseinfeld xe secretly show about cars the entire time no one has ever said that that xe really funny although think you could probably make list just as long with food and clothes
when you xe re flipping channels and you come across xe cseinfeld xe rerun do you flip right past it or do you linger right past it think there xe level of focus you need to get something to certain point creatively and you pay price for that which is you can xe ever look at it again
you turned down an offer from nbc of million an episode to do one more season of xe cseinfeld xe nobody in tv has ever made even close to that money before or since did you ever second guess that decision no it was the perfect moment and the proof that it was the right moment is the number of questions you xe re still asking me about it the most important word in art is xe cproportion xe how much how long is this joke going to be how many words how many minutes and getting that right is what makes it art or what makes it mediocre
you xe ve been outspoken about stand up audiences being too sensitive and politically correct these days have you ever apologized for joke no jokes are not real people assume that when you say something that you believe it it xe purely comedic invention you know do this whole bit about pop tarts and how much love them don xe love pop tarts it xe just funny it xe funny to say it so say it
what did you make of james gunn the xe cguardians of the galaxy xe director getting fired for his old twitter jokes didn xe read the jokes but if they xe re jokes it doesn xe matter guess roseanne barr thought she was being funny but it wasn xe funny xe and if it xe offensive and not funny then it xe not joke but any comedian that doesn xe understand that dynamic you xe re finished anyway
you use twitter mostly for self promotion why no twitter jokes don xe hear the laugh why waste my time it xe horrible performing interface can xe think of worse one always think about people that write books what horrible feeling it must be to have poured your soul into book over number of years and somebody comes up to you and goes xe ci loved your book xe and they walk away and you have no idea what worked and what didn xe that to me is hell that xe my definition of hell
let xe say that we xe re sending another voyager out into space and you get to choose the one joke we include on the golden record to represent comedy to the aliens what joke would you pick would put in rodney dangerfield xe joke xe ci was making love with my wife and she had faraway look in her eyes and said xe darling is there someone else xe and she said xe there must be xe xe xe that xe as perfect joke as can imagine

how do we govern in the age that will begin with the election
by thomas friedman
opinion columnist
have this feeling that the presidential election in the united states will be unlike any in my lifetime xe and not only because it will likely involve donald trump running as an incumbent xe he alone is one man three ring circus xe but also because the huge issue that should have been the focus of the election will be unavoidable by that is how do we govern the xe cnext america xe xe
xe cyou know william gibson xe line xe the future is already here it xe just not evenly distributed xe well the future is here and now it xe starting to really get distributed this is the next america but our institutions and political parties have not adapted to it xe xe gautam mukunda harvard kennedy school research fellow and the author of xe cindispensable when leaders really matter xe xe remarked in an interview by it will be impossible to ignore the next america xe cthe basic premises of how the economy works have shifted under our feet and the government will have to respond xe xe
this next america will raise whole web of new intertwined policy legal moral ethical and privacy issues because of changes in technology demographics the environment and globalization that are reaching critical mass
where do start good place is with xe fifth generation wireless systems with the two telecom giants verizon and at amp now beginning to deploy technology across the country the metabolism of business entertainment education and health care will dramatically accelerate in the next america beginning around xe xa
getting the most from artificial intelligence and machine learning xe like deploying self driving vehicles xe requires quickly transmitting massive amounts of data with very low latency we will have that capacity in the next america with hollywood movie that now takes six or seven minutes to download onto your ipad will take six or seven seconds and microsensors in your shirt will gather intelligence and broadcast vital signs to your doctor
as at amp notes in one of its ads xe cthink of this as the next frontier in untethering giving you the ability to take the ultrafast experience you have in your home or business with you virtually anywhere xe xe
it could be as revolutionary as the internet
but it will require all kinds of new regulations to govern applications from self driving cars to drone delivery systems to robots that will work as security guards and home health aides
an associated press report on monday said that the government estimated there were currently xe cabout commercial drones operating in airspace and the number is expected to soar to about in xe xe
all of this new technology will have important implications for the education to work pipeline my friend heather mcgowan future of work strategist puts it this way xe cthe old model of work was three life blocks get an education use that education for years and then retire we then made the faulty assumption that the next new model would be get an education use it for years then get retrained then use that for more years and then retire xe xe
but in fact in the next america argues mcgowan the right model will be xe ccontinuous lifelong learning xe xe xe because when the pace of change is accelerating xe cthe fastest growing companies and most resilient workers will be those who learn faster than their competition xe
that means that in addition to our traditional big safety nets xe social security and medicare xe we will need new national trampolines
we will need to make some level of postsecondary education free to every american who meets minimum grade and attendance requirement so that every adult and every high school graduate can earn an associate degree or technical certificate free of tuition at community college at any time
tennessee has already done that
these same technological transformations mean the next america will require changes in antitrust policy since the antitrust policy judged if company was getting too big largely by one question was the loss of competition hurting consumers through higher prices or fewer services
xe cbut that definition is increasingly irrelevant in an age in which the most powerful companies in the world offer products and services for xe free xe in exchange for personal data xe rana foroohar the financial times technology columnist noted in june essay xe cthis has provoked calls for return to the definition of monopoly in the sherman antitrust act which emphasizes the need to ensure that the economic power of large companies does not result in the corruption of the political process xe xe
that xe because we are more than consumers xe we xe re citizens xe xe notes mukunda xe cwe have interests that stretch far beyond consumer pricing and it xe the job of the government to protect citizens xe liberty not just consumers xe interests it says so right in the constitution and we xe ve forgotten that xe xe
just one person xe mark zuckerberg xe controls facebook whatsapp and instagram the fact that he has shown himself to be much more interested in scaling his platforms than combating those who abused them for political and economic gain xe and that his lieutenants were ready to go after their high profile critics like george soros xe should make breaking up or regulating facebook front and center issue in but just the raw political weight of behemoths like facebook amazon google microsoft and apple needs closer look
the next america is more than technology it literally will be born in the united states census bureau has predicted that by for the first time xe cmore than half of the nation xe children are expected to be part of minority race or ethnic group xe that will begin process by which by xe cno one racial or ethnic group will dominate the in terms of size xe npr reported
alas though the fiscal tools we need to build the next america have been weakened by president trump xe tax cuts the federal deficit was not supposed to hit trillion until but the white house now says it will hit that number in we xe ve had deficits this size in response to the financial crisis but we xe ve never run one so huge during boom
that means the next america may have to be built in the face of higher interest rates on more debt with less fiscal ammunition to stimulate the economy should it slow down or face crisis so the next america may very likely have to raise taxes or trim military spending or social security or medicare xe just when all the baby boomers are retiring
in sum the next america requires addressing each of those issues and many more xe from climate change to zoning rules xe and how they interact so the next election must too the craziness around trump has delayed much of this discussion but won xe let us do that again the next america won xe wait

five big thinkers xe regina barzilay george church jennifer egan catherine mohr and siddhartha mukherjee xe puzzle over the future of the future
by regina barzilay george church jennifer egan catherine mohr and siddhartha mukherjee nov
xe ca geneticist an oncologist roboticist novelist and an researcher walk into bar xe that could be the setup for very bad joke xe or tremendously fascinating conversation fortunately for us it was the latter on blustery evening in late september in private room at bar near times square the magazine gathered five brilliant scientists and thinkers around table for three hour dinner in the edited transcript below xe moderated by mark jannot story editor at the magazine and former editor in chief of popular science xe you can see what they had to say about the future of medicine health care and humanity
mark jannot for years many pregnant women have undergone amniocentesis to test for rare metabolic disorders and other fetal issues and couples who use in vitro fertilization can screen the embryos for genetic abnormalities what sorts of advances in genetic screening and manipulation are coming and where do you see that taking us
catherine mohr when was pregnant with my daughter my husband and were joking xe cwell if she gets the best of both of us she xe ll be superhero and if she gets the worst of both of us she xe not going to make it out of first grade xe and so we were rolling the genetic dice which you do when you choose to have child it xe not totally random of course there xe all kinds of great things about your mate xe that xe why you chose them xe and hopefully there xe some pretty good things about you too but the temptation to engineer what you think of as the best combination as we become more capable of doing it think it xe going to be irresistible for lot of people you xe re investing so much of your life into this little being and you xe re going to love this child and you want to give them every advantage in life we are already screening for diseases to avoid passing on our xe cbad xe genes but this same technology will let us start screening for our xe cbest xe genes xe the ones we really want to pass on as screening becomes cheaper easier and more reliable and more people are using assisted reproductive technologies see us as society sliding down that slippery slope pretty far one couple at time each trying to do what xe best for the child they are hoping to bring into the world
siddhartha mukherjee it xe certainly tempting path toward potentially terrifying slope but that only works if you do in vitro fertilization and create pool of testable embryos then you have to biopsy those embryos in dishes sequence their genes identify and interpret the gene variants that you want to select variant and and and and implant the xe cdesirable xe ones
george church or we may turn to gene editing if for example you have dominant allele disorder like huntington xe disease or marfan syndrome and you want to have children you could edit the sperm change that allele so that all sperm are healthy and your offspring will be fine all sperm come from spermatogonial stem cells in the man xe testes you can use editing tools and work on stem cells in petri dishes so that you xe re removing the bad allele and replacing it with dna that has been designed and synthesized on computer controlled machines and then you can implant pure population in which you xe ve checked that the edit is what you wanted it to be with all cells with only the desired xe con target xe changes this has been done in mice it xe great opportunity it xe only one time and they xe re good for life in principle
jannot and why is that not being done now
church until recently we didn xe have good methods for doing gene therapy that we could apply to editing stem cells sperm cells
jennifer egan how hard is it to edit genes
mukherjee well that xe one of the surprises is how extraordinarily easy it is there are still technical challenges and some of them may be hard to surmount but the protocol is quite simple we recently edited gene in human blood stem cells to enable therapy for some forms of leukemia we xe ve sequenced the genomes of the edited cells and have not found single xe coff target xe effect thus far although we are still looking for other genes off target effects have been reported so it seems that it xe case dependent but over all the fidelity of the system seems quite remarkable
church at this point there xe nothing published in the literature demonstrating successful editing of human sperm stem cells the germline but if you want to edit the dna of say pigs it xe very easy with crispr which is set of editing tools that uses enzymes guided by rna and proteins to make change at precise location in your dna you xe re injecting small thing in that changes as little as one base pair out of six billion in each cell so it xe nanosurgery xe very precise and automatically in many cells at once
mukherjee it xe like taking massive encyclopedia and saying go to volume section page paragraph and change the word xe cthis xe to the word xe cthat xe xe simplifying of course
mohr and to use your encyclopedia analogy everyone who is unlucky enough to have their edition of the encyclopedia printed with xe cthis xe gets sickle cell anemia and everyone whose edition has xe cthat xe doesn xe but george while you are saying we can xe quite do gene editing of the germline cells for producing genetic disease free children editing genes in the adult xe gene therapies aimed at altering all of the mature cells in an already formed organ or cancer xe you xe re saying that xe closer
church some gene therapies involve adding missing genes others involve subtracting toxic versions of genes and some involve precise editing and yes it xe getting closer there are some gene therapies that are already approved for human use
mukherjee at least one that is approved is for retina diseases not gene editing xe changing the native genes in the genome xe but introducing new genetic material into human cells that xe because introducing viruses carrying new genetic material into the eye is easier you can inject viruses because the immune system does not seem to be as active in the retina and the injected virus doesn xe spread all over the body
but the ones that involve gene editing are on their way they xe re in the pipeline there xe lab at stanford that xe doing gene editing on blood stem cells for sickle cell disease then you can transplant those blood cells and replace the diseased cells and the sickle cell disease should be cured we xe ll get comfortable with it and by comfort mean not just becoming comfortable with technically how to do it but realizing it doesn xe all of sudden cause some horrible cancer or some terrible disease which if you ask me think is quite unlikely but at some point the decision will come down to the and other organizations they xe ll have to say let xe go forward bottom line our capacity to become more comfortable with the consequences of gene editing will come from diseases where the stakes as it were are more simple and higher xe especially with disease like acute myeloid leukemia where there xe an extremely high mortality rate xe and then we xe ll backtrack our way into reproductive technology
church think it xe more likely we xe ll be using gene therapy first in childhood diseases based on the realization that many diseases make permanent damage by the time the child is born like blindness for example xe if you don xe correct it very early in life you can xe ccure xe blindness in the sense that they can see photons but they can xe really process them into an image
mohr blindness is an interesting one in this context it isn xe life threatening like the leukemias sid was talking about but the problem is an absence of function which seems in some ways less risky to tackle if you fail trying to fix it you haven xe made it worse xe the person is still blind xe but if you do succeed there is only upside can imagine these are the kinds of deficits we xe be most eager to try to address because of the way we as people think about risk we xe re with risking that things will get better but not too happy doing it when there is chance they xe ll get worse
church then there are the diseases that won xe affect people until late in life but they could be treated with gene therapy very early in life this may be the case with alzheimer xe we already know that the alleles that are highly associated with alzheimer xe are something called app for early stage alzheimer xe and the apoe variant for late stage we could change them in the sperm cell to an allele that already exists in the population and you xe re changing it essentially percent because it xe going through this bottleneck of single stem cell and you xe re not trying to change it to gene that no one xe ever tested before it xe gene that xe been xe ctested xe millions of times in the millions of people in whom it occurs naturally
mohr so in the same way that woman might take folate before and during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects in the fetus you xe have your partner take the gene therapy to do some allele substitution xe co honey love lot about you but we xe re going to need to edit out that cystic fibrosis variant and tweak those alzheimer xe alleles of yours before we start thinking about kids xe
egan speaking as someone who is terrified of alzheimer xe engineering it away is an appealing prospect but wonder who exactly would have access to this technology even basic reproductive technologies like are expensive so less possible for poor people one unintended consequence it seems to me could be small number of extremely healthy genetically engineered elites and large and comparatively ill and genetically challenged underclass
church but all of these technologies are constantly getting cheaper xe look at what happened with the cost of sequencing the genome from billions when we first did it to few hundred dollars today think these therapies would end up similar to preventive medicines like vaccines vaccines are enhancement relative to our ancestors and they xe ve been able to be made ubiquitous our ancestors lived in mortal fear of all these diseases and we just take it for granted that we xe re immune to them
egan xe struck by the tremendous confidence with which you talk about these things almost as if they had already happened you xe re thinking forward to point when all of this will be matter of course but xe still back at the point where it all sounds so speculative find myself thinking whoa what about operator error mean nothing technical works simply or perfectly ever and yet so much of what we take for granted now xe flying in airplanes for example xe would have struck me as equally hubristic in the planning stages and of course it is catastrophic when plane crashes but that xe an extreme rarity
regina barzilay we xe re working with complex system that we are only beginning to understand today it xe well known from selective breeding of domestic animals that selecting for one target trait often brings along many other undesirable and often unexpected traits let xe say you guys identified genetic fix to problem how likely is it that changing xe cthis xe to xe cthat xe following your analogy is going to bring some other unexpected side effects that we cannot control
church well in some of these things you xe re literally changing gene to what is healthy for instance in the case of sickle cell changing particular gene variant to what everybody else has is probably pretty safe as long as you can be sure that xe what xe actually happening so the probability of unexpected consequences seems quite low once we go forward as we get more and more confidence we will start taking bigger and bigger steps then we might end up with something that has unintended consequences you know eliminating smallpox from the entire world could have had negative consequences we rolled the dice and figured that we could back up if there were some problem to think that genetics is irreversible is no more likely than that eradicating smallpox is irreversible
jannot what are the most interesting applications for in medicine right now
barzilay this is great question companies like google and facebook track every action you take online and use that to build model of your preferences they then use this model to personalize the complete user experience the content you see the products they recommend to you the advertisements they show you in some ways they know more about you than you know about yourself but if you go to any clinic for cancer heart disease you name it xe there is no
learned this in very personal way when was went in for routine mammogram and all of sudden was diagnosed with breast cancer this was big shock because to the best of my knowledge nobody in my family had ever been diagnosed with cancer at every point in my treatment had many more questions than my doctors had answers to remember did my mammogram and they said xe cyour cancer is really tiny xe said xe cgreat xe then we went to and suddenly they see cancer all over then they did biopsy and they discovered it xe actually small the was false positive how can we have this high resolution modality and still not know that this is false positive
for me as computer scientist working in artificial intelligence it seemed obvious to train machine to make these kinds of predictions if you look at what was happening in computer vision systems could already identify very subtle distinctions between images at level of detail that xe hard for the human eye to differentiate why do people need to undergo unnecessary procedures and live with months of uncertainty while the technology that can fully resolve the situation already exists
and this was just one of many steps in the treatment pipeline where saw how artificial intelligence could transform cancer diagnosis and treatment as an researcher was stunned to see all these opportunities to help patients squandered from patient xe perspective it felt cruel we xe re talking about well understood technology commercially deployed in other industries not brand new research and this is general trend it doesn xe matter what your disease is today is not yet part of clinical treatment
mohr this is problem that really affects providers also xe patients xe medical data are kept in all of these separate systems so it xe hard to get all the data about even one patient if there are multiple doctors involved in the care let alone being able to compare the data on many different patients it evolved this way because we used to have paper records with narrative descriptions of each patient xe condition and our privacy laws never anticipated the tools we would have today xe and what we could do with the data
jannot so what needs to happen
mohr revamping our practices and regulations around medical data while maintaining individual privacy will be essential both for patients like regina and for researchers like regina it xe likely to be slow but it is starting
barzilay for my part when finally came back to my work at my experience as cancer patient had totally changed my perspective and could not just go back to my old research started asking what is the best way to spend my time my mental energy could not forget the suffering and pain saw in the hospital wanted to use data to provide answers now it took me while to find like minded clinical collaborators and zoom in on specific questions that were meaningful to me but also could be implemented in the clinic
ultimately that brought me to two areas one of them relates to something very basic in clinical research xe extracting relevant information from patients xe electronic records even though every hospital sits on gold mine of data it xe severely underutilized by care providers and clinical researchers because the records are mostly in text unless they xe re specifically trained machines cannot read these stories they expect database where information is properly structured and so today if you as patient want to know how patients like yourself responded to treatment in your hospital you can xe find the answer even in the most prestigious journals almost all the studies that use past patient data do that data extraction by hand which is expensive and slow and dramatically limits the scope of these studies
in my core field of research natural language processing we xe ve developed lots of tools that can automate this task and so we applied those tools to create database of more than patients with breast disease from massachusetts general and other partner hospitals that spans decades now with one simple query you can find cohort of patients with the same disease features and study it over time
another thing xe working on relates to reading mammograms today the risk models used in clinical practice are very imprecise our ability to predict who is going to get cancer is very very low our idea was to let the machine algorithm look for patterns in the raw mammographic image if it looks at the mammogram from five years earlier of woman who went on to develop cancer can it detect patterns
the first step was to work with connie lehman head of breast cancer radiology at to use radiologists xe best judgment to train the model and that did improve the predictive results but we felt that it didn xe fully reach the goal we wanted the machine to utilize all the information in the image not just the things that radiologists are trained to spot as disease markers we trained the machine to look at the whole image and we fed in all the data about outcomes and we said what is the likelihood that this person is going to get cancer in certain time this system worked way way better than any risk models currently in clinical practice
we are now thinking of expanding our work to prescreen for lung and pancreatic cancer imagine how it can change the game if these diseases which are now diagnosed late when they are largely uncurable could be detected early xe how many lives can be saved that is the way that can transform medicine it will identify patterns far too subtle for humans to identify
mohr regina is talking about very specific kind of xe machine learning and natural language processing rather than what we think of in popular culture robots in the movies who walk and talk and crack jokes we xe ll have lots of beautiful analysis capability like regina is talking about long before we have po
in surgery we xe re also starting to use the same sorts of tools that regina is applying to radiology images and natural language analysis of medical records but we xe re doing it with surgical videos and data from operations data that we can readily harvest from surgical robots these are machines that surgeons operate as extensions of themselves enabling them to perform extremely delicate surgeries through small incisions and watch what xe going on inside the patient xe body via video feed they can actually see better than if they had cut the patient open and the machine records every movement made and captures that video of the operation
it is amazing how much trained human can tell from just looking at single frame of surgical procedure well trained surgical resident can walk into an operating room where surgery is underway and can glance up and with one look at the screen know what kind of procedure it is what step you are at in the procedure xe they know what xe going to happen next and they can tell if it xe going well or not using clues like if you xe ve got lot of blood in the field or from looking at the body language of all the people in the operating room is the surgeon stressed out has the music been turned down are people still talking what are they saying there xe all kinds of clues
we can use the data in those videos use machine learning and natural language processing to train an to be able to pick up on all these same clues and to be able recognize the same things the resident can and then ideally to be able to help you with what might be the best next step it would be like providing every surgeon with the perfect surgical resident
to achieve this it isn xe just recognizing what is in the picture or the sounds these algorithms need to understand the context where you are in the procedure what xe going to happen and what should ordinarily happen next to do all that we need to train them on lot of data looking at how thousand different surgeons do exactly that same step and what best practices are and maybe clustered into five different styles of doing this particular surgery so you can tell which step to recommend next the key is that by turning surgery into data we can now start to use these remarkably powerful machine learning tools to analyze and learn from these data but first you need data we xe re lucky with our robots but in many areas of medicine it is hard to get your hands on the kind of data you need
jannot so george as you mentioned earlier we xe ve seen exponential decreases in the cost of sequencing genome imagine cheap genome sequencing leads to ubiquitous genome sequencing which leads to superabundant new stream of data to plumb for insights and new health advances
church that xe right we xe ve gone from it costing almost billion for clinically unacceptable genome in to less than in for high quality genome that precisely analyzes the dna you inherited from your mother and father just started company called nebula genomics whose intention is to make it zero dollars or less at this point everyone should be getting paid to sequence their genomes because the system could save something on the order of million dollars every time we save single child from rare genetic disease that million dollars should then be spread out to all people who participated including the percent of people who didn xe get any bad news
mukherjee in terms of what will drive future advances there is the whole aspect of the genome and then there xe the whole aspect of what people have called the phenome xe things that we do things that we express environmental things that happen to us how we interact with the environment both are data sets one of them is now highly accessible data set and with nebula it will become zero dollar data set the other one is not zero dollar data set yet but very soon you can imagine carrying some kind of gopro in which data becomes so cheap that you can start really monitoring that second data set what you do what you eat whether you run how much you run the number of fitbit steps etc imagine the density of individuated information that comes from all this
one implication is that years from now we become kind of clinical trial society in which empirically driven decisions are constantly popping up but by clinical trial society mean all sorts of questions because the information net becomes so rich xe and the capacity to understand or deconvolute that information because of computational power and because of dependent algorithms becomes so rich xe that we begin to subject aspects of human behavior human selves that were previously considered outside the realm of assessment to kind of deeper clinical assessment
mohr the natural extension of that is we have some kind of personal doomsday clock and each action that we take is either extending it or decrementing it so put something bad in my mouth and start to eat it and see that that dropped my doomsday clock little bit go out for run and see that it bumps my doomsday clock up little bit xe can see the immediate projected effect of all of the actions take if we could measure all of those things people would be carrying their doomsday clock algorithms around
egan what about privacy if every fact about my body can be known and if my knowledge of those facts depends on corporations helping me to track and measure the data will not be able to control whose hands that information falls into as to what we do and think and express social media is already quantifying our behavior in exchange for giving us platform and access we pay price for opening ourselves to corporate data systems in exchange for information ultimately anyone will be able to know anything about anyone and that xe vulnerability
mohr privacy is at the heart of the problem around availability of medical data for training the machine learning algorithms that we were talking about earlier those of us who look at the data and see all the good it could do have hard time imagining hurting people with that same data and yet the possibility exists that the very things that teach us how to help people who have condition will allow others to discriminate against them or victimize them because of that condition these are hard problems but we should try to figure out how to get the greatest societal good out of this data without putting those who donate it at risk xe the benefit to us all is so potentially great to shy away from it because it is xe chard to do xe has victims too xe someone who dies when we didn xe know how to help them knowledge that would have been available if we had been able to pool our data xe that person is worth figuring out how to save we xe re already figuring this out first in the diseases like cancer because patients are very motivated to share their data
mukherjee yes and it begins to raise the question of too much information with cancer we are already micromonitoring through blood tests visual tests etc the crucial bar that we have to cross for cancer is whether those tests actually have an impact on saving lives or not ultimately the question is whether we end up detecting cancers that are clinically relevant invasive aggressive likely to kill you xe or will we be detecting thousands of cancers that aren xe actually relevant and won xe kill you and cause all sorts of economic consequences this phenomenon is called xe coverdiagnosis xe and it xe real concern among those who create cancer detection tests my opinion is that we will eventually find ways to discriminate one from the other but there are people who are skeptics in the field who feel that we will be overrun with useless information
mohr it xe all about feedback loops if you xe re trying to control something and you want specific outcome you want to be measuring continuously and measuring in way that allows you to immediately tell the effects of each thing you do because the thing you xe re trying to change is behavior we can already do continuous glucose monitoring with patch that just pierces the skin
church you might even have an inside outside thing where the skin is intact but you xe ve got something on the inside that xe communicating
mohr well in sweden people are having rfid chips implanted in their skin so that they can pay just with this thing in their skin like apple pay
church it xe probably less invasive than tattooing
jannot what will it mean if we xe re going through our life getting constant feedback about our bodies now our bodies in the future
egan can only answer that as fiction writer because as person don xe live that way and don xe want to because xe not scientist xe interested in these things as they pertain to human inner life and come at it as someone who is uninterested in machines for their own sake think they xe re dull
mohr for what it xe worth don xe think jenny needs to be interested in her data for the monitoring of it to be useful to her at some point we monitor our electricity use continuously how often do you look at your electricity meter you never look at it unless you get an unusually high bill or something flags it then you xe re glad it was being measured
mukherjee expect that those who are well won xe look but the ill will look and the ill could be not just the physically ill they could be the anxious could be the mentally ill could be those of us who have anxieties about our children our futures could be societies that are in peril
jannot what xe this going to do to hypochondria
mohr yeah that could be problem imagine your body giving you xe clikes xe from your measured parameters hypochondriacs would be like social media addicts or maybe they xe just become extreme optimizers
egan there xe paranoid vision that comes right alongside it which is xe cthere xe machine inside me doing something and have to get rid of it xe it doesn xe matter if machine is there or not that possibility is going to live in the minds of people who think that way
barzilay but would you get it implanted if you didn xe want it
egan you might fear that someone else had implanted it in you during the world wars people all over the world worried that german spies were hidden around them imagine what it might be like to fear something that may be inside you think about how telecommunications technology has saturated our inner lives xe our hyperemphasis on the visual the curating and display of daily life the constant monitoring of others in the end the technology seeps into our private experience so when think of someone installing device inside his or her body to pay bills xe appalled but as fiction writer xe ecstatic
jannot so let xe say that all this stuff works we have lot of monitoring we have lot of great data xe what xe the goal of it all
mohr if think about my goals for myself it leads into why have chosen this particular mission for my career xe why everyone at this table has chosen to delve as deeply into the things they do xe it xe about improving the human condition and also not incidentally making the science better for when we and our loved ones need it it xe why build minimally invasive surgical tools this is also why keep up to date on my screening tests and think about better ways of monitoring the body if at some point get cancer want it to be stage and xe like surgical excision to be cure in that situation and want tiny incision using monitoring and technology to do small course corrections rather than needing to do salvage when we are too far along in an illness
church when it comes to how we think about changing aging from our current normal there are two major strategies here one is extending longevity and the other is aging reversal the problem with longevity extension is if you xe re not careful you extend some of the weaker years of your life which is not what we want aging reversal on the other hand sounds little more speculative but there are several examples demonstrated in mice where you can return old adult cells to embryonic stage by using transcription factor to regulate certain genes another reason to do aging reversal rather than longevity is that it xe hard to get funding for long trial of longevity drug even for veterinary drug because if you say it xe going to extend dog xe life by years that xe year clinical trial if you say that within five weeks it xe going to make them stronger and more resistant to injury then that xe five week experiment
mukherjee in terms of longevity the diseases that are most likely to kill us are neurological diseases and heart disease and cancer in some other countries there is tuberculosis and malaria and other infectious diseases but here it xe the chronic diseases that dominate there are three ways to think about these chronic diseases one is the disease specific way so you attack alzheimer xe as alzheimer xe you attack cancer as cancer the second one is that you forget about the disease specific manners of attacking diseases and you attack longevity or aging reversal in general you change diet change genes change whatever else xe we might call them xe ctrans factors xe which would simply override the xe ccis factors xe that existed for individual diseases and the third option is some combination of that and some digital form of immortality which is that you record yourself forever that you clone yourself and somehow pass along that recording which is to say that the body is just repository of memories images times and as repository there xe nothing special about it the body per se the mortal coil is just coil
egan feel of two minds about longevity on one hand want to live to be very very old partly because had kids on the late side and want to know their children as my mother xe who had me at xe has known mine but taking step back the mass possibility of extreme longevity has selfish devouring aspect mean we xe re taxing the planet so hard as it is the least we can do is not hang around forever
jannot and will we really want to mean realize this is fanciful question but if this all works in say years will we be happier will we have less sorrow in our society
egan don xe know because we already confront so much less death than people did say before antibiotics but does having fewer of those losses really make us happier
church after de aging xe or as part of it xe we may set happiness itself as goal we have clearly set as goals simple measures like lowering cholesterol but we xe re just beginning to study genetically engineering behavioral phenomena related to happiness
mohr xe not sure we really understand enough about sorrow and contentment to know there was book on people in extreme and terrible environments like concentration camps and then also on people xe just general malaise the goals were looking at what were the characteristics of people who were psychologically resistant to tragedy and what seemed to be most important were meaning mastery and autonomy xe feeling that there is some kind of meaning associated with things you do working toward the acquisition of new skills and the ability to make choices for yourself when you xe ve got those three things you are more resistant to tragedy maybe that is the secret to contentment
mukherjee but if machines are doing all the work then we xe ll have none of those things we won xe have mastery we won xe have meaning we won xe have autonomy
mohr but we xe ll have art xe art and mastery oriented things like learning musical instruments
church but our future selves may not consider that rewarding xe if our musical instrument is worse than the machine xe musical instrument our chess worse than the machine xe chess if our mastery is lower meaning is lower because what does it mean to be able to be poor imitation of machine
egan maybe machine will be able to play the cello better than human but we go to the philharmonic to hear yo yo ma humans are more interesting than machines plain and simple
mohr funny you mention cello because that is the instrument play there are plenty of people and even probably some machines who can play the cello better than do but that doesn xe take meaning away love the feeling of progression as attain mastery xe the beauty or the frustration in the moment and it is my choice to keep trying xe to keep creating think there is still great potential for humans to enjoy their lives in the time after menial work is done by machines
barzilay actually believe that machines can help us achieve our goals better than we can do on our own we are already using technology to expand our cognitive capacity xe for instance with machine translation we can read documents in foreign languages that we don xe know why can xe we expand this cognitive assistance to happiness happiness means different things to different people but it is often linked to specific behaviors machines have immense capacity to remember our actions and predict our future behavior this gives them the capacity to help us modify our behavior so we become our better selves in my case simple heart monitoring app changed the frequency and intensity of my running the app gives points for achieving certain fitness goals when first saw it just laughed and thought who can be motivated by these silly rewards but guess what every morning at am running rain deadlines sleepiness xe nothing stops me from getting my running points and this change in my life has really made me happier
mohr exactly you have clearly found purpose in getting better at running and even though car could drive you faster that isn xe the point at all but both of our examples need bodies sid in your vision of the uploaded consciousness you xe re assuming that the body wears out but the mind can persist wonder if there isn xe another ceiling beyond that in which the consciousness no longer wants to be conscious do you get immortality by uploading and then you feel this horrible sense of eternal ennui because you were uploaded and can no longer decide to learn to play the cello or go running along the charles river
mukherjee you xe re stuck being conscious
egan think we xe re forgetting basic truth about human life transience is what makes it precious the inevitability of death infuses our lives with meaning and urgency hard to imagine sustaining those qualities in an eternally uploaded consciousness you xe re left with just sensation xe not sure that xe gain in the end
church well if you have simple aging reversal so you actually feel like changed from being to being xe can do everything could do when was plus have the experience of being older and the open ended explorations ahead of reading and writing our universe xe doubt that xe going to have serious case of ennui
mohr you could even take up the cello

last year the food and drug administration approved device that can capture an image of your retina and automatically detect signs of diabetic blindness
this new breed of artificial intelligence technology is rapidly spreading across the medical field as scientists develop systems that can identify signs of illness and disease in wide variety of images from rays of the lungs to scans of the brain these systems promise to help doctors evaluate patients more efficiently and less expensively than in the past
similar forms of artificial intelligence are likely to move beyond hospitals into the computer systems used by health care regulators billing companies and insurance providers just as will help doctors check your eyes lungs and other organs it will help insurance providers determine reimbursement payments and policy fees
ideally such systems would improve the efficiency of the health care system but they may carry unintended consequences group of researchers at harvard and warns
in paper published on thursday in the journal science the researchers raise the prospect of xe cadversarial attacks xe xe manipulations that can change the behavior of systems using tiny pieces of digital data by changing few pixels on lung scan for instance someone could fool an system into seeing an illness that is not really there or not seeing one that is
like the science times page on facebook sign up for the science times newsletter
software developers and regulators must consider such scenarios as they build and evaluate technologies in the years to come the authors argue the concern is less that hackers might cause patients to be misdiagnosed although that potential exists more likely is that doctors hospitals and other organizations could manipulate the in billing or insurance software in an effort to maximize the money coming their way
samuel finlayson researcher at harvard medical school and and one of the authors of the paper warned that because so much money changes hands across the health care industry stakeholders are already bilking the system by subtly changing billing codes and other data in computer systems that track health care visits could exacerbate the problem
xe cthe inherent ambiguity in medical information coupled with often competing financial incentives allows for high stakes decisions to swing on very subtle bits of information xe he said
the new paper adds to growing sense of concern about the possibility of such attacks which could be aimed at everything from face recognition services and driverless cars to iris scanners and fingerprint readers
an adversarial attack exploits fundamental aspect of the way many systems are designed and built increasingly is driven by neural networks complex mathematical systems that learn tasks largely on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data
by analyzing thousands of eye scans for instance neural network can learn to detect signs of diabetic blindness this xe cmachine learning xe happens on such an enormous scale xe human behavior is defined by countless disparate pieces of data xe that it can produce unexpected behavior of its own
in team at carnegie mellon used patterns printed on eyeglass frames to fool face recognition systems into thinking the wearers were celebrities when the researchers wore the frames the systems mistook them for famous people including milla jovovich and john malkovich
group of chinese researchers pulled similar trick by projecting infrared light from the underside of hat brim onto the face of whoever wore the hat the light was invisible to the wearer but it could trick face recognition system into thinking the wearer was say the musician moby who is caucasian rather than an asian scientist
researchers have also warned that adversarial attacks could fool self driving cars into seeing things that are not there by making small changes to street signs they have duped cars into detecting yield sign instead of stop sign
late last year team at xe tandon school of engineering created virtual fingerprints capable of fooling fingerprint readers percent of the time in other words percent of all phones or pcs that used such readers potentially could be unlocked
the implications are profound given the increasing prevalence of biometric security devices and other systems india has implemented the world xe largest fingerprint based identity system to distribute government stipends and services banks are introducing face recognition access to companies such as waymo which is owned by the same parent company as google are testing self driving cars on public roads
now mr finlayson and his colleagues have raised the same alarm in the medical field as regulators insurance providers and billing companies begin using in their software systems businesses can learn to game the underlying algorithms
if an insurance company uses to evaluate medical scans for instance hospital could manipulate scans in an effort to boost payouts if regulators build systems to evaluate new technology device makers could alter images and other data in an effort to trick the system into granting regulatory approval
in their paper the researchers demonstrated that by changing small number of pixels in an image of benign skin lesion diagnostic system could be tricked into identifying the lesion as malignant simply rotating the image could also have the same effect they found
small changes to written descriptions of patient xe condition also could alter an diagnosis xe calcohol abuse xe could produce different diagnosis than xe calcohol dependence xe and xe clumbago xe could produce different diagnosis than xe cback pain
in turn changing such diagnoses one way or another could readily benefit the insurers and health care agencies that ultimately profit from them once is deeply rooted in the health care system the researchers argue business will gradually adopt behavior that brings in the most money
the end result could harm patients mr finlayson said changes that doctors make to medical scans or other patient data in an effort to satisfy the used by insurance companies could end up on patient xe permanent record and affect decisions down the road
already doctors hospitals and other organizations sometimes manipulate the software systems that control the billions of dollars moving across the industry doctors for instance have subtly changed billing codes xe for instance describing simple ray as more complicated scan xe in an effort to boost payouts
hamsa bastani an assistant professor at the wharton business school at the university of pennsylvania who has studied the manipulation of health care systems believes it is significant problem xe csome of the behavior is unintentional but not all of it xe she said
as specialist in machine learning systems she questioned whether the introduction of will make the problem worse carrying out an adversarial attack in the real world is difficult and it is still unclear whether regulators and insurance companies will adopt the kind of machine learning algorithms that are vulnerable to such attacks
but she added it xe worth keeping an eye on xe cthere are always unintended consequences particularly in health care xe she said

san francisco xe for years tech industry financiers showed little interest in start up companies that made computer chips
how on earth could start up compete with goliath like intel which made the chips that ran more than percent of the world xe personal computers even in the areas where intel didn xe dominate like smartphones and gaming devices there were companies like qualcomm and nvidia that could squash an upstart
but then came the tech industry xe latest big thing xe artificial intelligence it turned out works better with new kinds of computer chips suddenly venture capitalists forgot all those forbidding roadblocks to success for young chip company
today at least start ups are working on chips that can power tasks like speech and self driving cars and at least five of them have raised more than million from investors venture capitalists invested more than billion in chip start ups last year nearly doubling the investments made two years ago according to the research firm cb insights
the explosion is akin to the sudden proliferation of pc and hard drive makers in the while these are small companies and not all will survive they have the power to fuel period of rapid technological change
it is doubtful that any of the companies fantasize about challenging intel head on with their own chip factories which can take billions of dollars to build the start ups contract with other companies to make their chips but in designing chips that can provide the particular kind of computing power needed by machines learning how to do more and more things these start ups are racing toward one of two goals find profitable niche or get acquired fast
xe cmachine learning and has reopened questions around how to build computers xe said bill coughran who helped oversee the global infrastructure at google for several years and is now partner at sequoia the silicon valley venture capital firm sequoia has invested in graphcore british start up that recently joined the million club
by the summer of the change was apparent google microsoft and other internet giants were building apps that could instantly identify faces in photos and recognize commands spoken into smartphones by using algorithms known as neural networks that can learn tasks by identifying patterns in large amounts of data
nvidia was best known for making graphics processing units or which were designed to help render complex images for games and other software xe and it turned out they worked really well for neural networks too nvidia sold million in chips for the massive computer data centers run by companies like google in the year leading up to that summer xe double the year before
intel scrambled to catch up it acquired nervana employee silicon valley start up that had started building an chip from scratch for million according to report from the tech news site recode
after that second silicon valley start up cerebras grabbed five nervana engineers as it too designed chip just for
by early according to report by forbes cerebras had raised more than million in funding so had four other firms graphcore another silicon valley outfit wave computing and two beijing companies horizon robotics and cambricon which is backed by the chinese government
raising money in and early was nightmare said mike henry chief executive at the chip start up mythic but xe cwith the big aquisition hungry tech companies all barreling toward semiconductors xe that has changed he said
china has shown particular interest in developing new chips third beijing chip start up deephi has raised million and the country xe ministry of science and technology has explicitly called for the production of chinese chips that challenge nvidia xe
because it xe new market xe and because there is such hunger for this new kind of processing power xe many believe this is one of those rare opportunities when start ups have chance against entrenched giants
the first big change will most likely come in the data center where companies like graphcore and cerebras which has been quiet about its plans hope to accelerate the creation of new forms of among the goals are bots that can carry on conversations and systems that can automatically generate video and virtual reality
researchers at places like microsoft and google which has built its own chip just for xe ctrain xe neural networks by extreme trial and error testing the algorithms across vast numbers of chips for hours and even days on end they often sit at their laptops staring at graphs that show the progress of these algorithms as they learn from data chip designers want to streamline this process packing all that trial and error into few minutes
today nvidia xe can efficiently execute all the tiny calculations that go into training neural networks but shuttling data between these chips is still inefficient said scott gray who was an engineer at nervana before joining openai an artificial intelligence lab whose founder include tesla xe chief executive elon musk
so in addition to building chips specifically for neural networks start ups are rethinking the hardware that surrounds them
graphcore for example is building chips that include more built in memory so that they don xe need to send as much data back and forth others are looking at ways of widening the pipes between chips so that data exchange happens faster
xe cthis is not just about building chips but looking at how these chips are connected together and how they talk to the rest of the system xe mr coughran of sequoia said
but this is only part of the change once neural networks are trained for task additional gear has to execute that task at toyota autonomous car prototypes are using neural networks as way of identifying pedestrians signs and other objects on the road after training neural network in the data center the company runs this algorithm on chips installed on the car
number of chip makers xe including start ups like mythic deephi and horizon robotics xe are tackling this problem as well pushing chips into devices ranging from phones to cars
it is still unclear how well any of these new chips will work designing and building chip takes about months which means even the first viable hardware relying on them won xe arrive until this year and the chip start ups will face competition from nvidia intel google and other industry giants
but everyone is starting from about the same place the beginning of new market

researchers can now send secret audio instructions undetectable to the human ear to apple xe siri amazon xe alexa and google xe assistant

berkeley calif xe many people have grown accustomed to talking to their smart devices asking them to read text play song or set an alarm but someone else might be secretly talking to them too
over the last two years researchers in china and the united states have begun demonstrating that they can send hidden commands that are undetectable to the human ear to apple xe siri amazon xe alexa and google xe assistant inside university labs the researchers have been able to secretly activate the artificial intelligence systems on smartphones and smart speakers making them dial phone numbers or open websites in the wrong hands the technology could be used to unlock doors wire money or buy stuff online xe simply with music playing over the radio
group of students from university of california berkeley and georgetown university showed in that they could hide commands in white noise played over loudspeakers and through youtube videos to get smart devices to turn on airplane mode or open website
this month some of those berkeley researchers published research paper that went further saying they could embed commands directly into recordings of music or spoken text so while human listener hears someone talking or an orchestra playing amazon xe echo speaker might hear an instruction to add something to your shopping list
xe cwe wanted to see if we could make it even more stealthy xe said nicholas carlini fifth year ph student in computer security at berkeley and one of the paper xe authors
read more on what alexa can hear when brought into your home
mr carlini added that while there was no evidence that these techniques have left the lab it may only be matter of time before someone starts exploiting them xe cmy assumption is that the malicious people already employ people to do what do xe he said
these deceptions illustrate how artificial intelligence xe even as it is making great strides xe can still be tricked and manipulated computers can be fooled into identifying an airplane as cat just by changing few pixels of digital image while researchers can make self driving car swerve or speed up simply by pasting small stickers on road signs and confusing the vehicle xe computer vision system
with audio attacks the researchers are exploiting the gap between human and machine speech recognition speech recognition systems typically translate each sound to letter eventually compiling those into words and phrases by making slight changes to audio files researchers were able to cancel out the sound that the speech recognition system was supposed to hear and replace it with sound that would be transcribed differently by machines while being nearly undetectable to the human ear
the proliferation of voice activated gadgets amplifies the implications of such tricks smartphones and smart speakers that use digital assistants like amazon xe alexa or apple xe siri are set to outnumber people by according to the research firm ovum and more than half of all american households will have at least one smart speaker by then according to juniper research
amazon said that it doesn xe disclose specific security measures but it has taken steps to ensure its echo smart speaker is secure google said security is an ongoing focus and that its assistant has features to mitigate undetectable audio commands both companies xe assistants employ voice recognition technology to prevent devices from acting on certain commands unless they recognize the user xe voice
apple said its smart speaker homepod is designed to prevent commands from doing things like unlocking doors and it noted that iphones and ipads must be unlocked before siri will act on commands that access sensitive data or open apps and websites among other measures
yet many people leave their smartphones unlocked and at least for now voice recognition systems are notoriously easy to fool
there is already history of smart devices being exploited for commercial gains through spoken commands
last year burger king caused stir with an online ad that purposely asked xe google what is the whopper burger xe android devices with voice enabled search would respond by reading from the whopper xe wikipedia page the ad was canceled after viewers started editing the wikipedia page to comic effect
read more on how we may soon be living in alexa xe world
few months later the animated series south park followed up with an entire episode built around voice commands that caused viewers xe voice recognition assistants to parrot adolescent obscenities
there is no american law against broadcasting subliminal messages to humans let alone machines the federal communications commission discourages the practice as xe ccounter to the public interest xe and the television code of the national association of broadcasters bans xe ctransmitting messages below the threshold of normal awareness xe neither say anything about subliminal stimuli for smart devices
courts have ruled that subliminal messages may constitute an invasion of privacy but the law has not extended the concept of privacy to machines
now the technology is racing even further ahead of the law last year researchers at princeton university and china xe zhejiang university demonstrated that voice recognition systems could be activated by using frequencies inaudible to the human ear the attack first muted the phone so the owner wouldn xe hear the system xe responses either
the technique which the chinese researchers called dolphinattack can instruct smart devices to visit malicious websites initiate phone calls take picture or send text messages while dolphinattack has its limitations xe the transmitter must be close to the receiving device xe experts warned that more powerful ultrasonic systems were possible
that warning was borne out in april when researchers at the university of illinois at urbana champaign demonstrated ultrasound attacks from feet away while the commands couldn xe penetrate walls they could control smart devices through open windows from outside building
this year another group of chinese and american researchers from china xe academy of sciences and other institutions demonstrated they could control voice activated devices with commands embedded in songs that can be broadcast over the radio or played on services like youtube
more recently mr carlini and his colleagues at berkeley have incorporated commands into audio recognized by mozilla xe deepspeech voice to text translation software an open source platform they were able to hide the command xe co google browse to evil com xe in recording of the spoken phrase xe cwithout the data set the article is useless xe humans cannot discern the command
the berkeley group also embedded the command in music files including four second clip from verdi xe xe crequiem xe
how device makers respond will differ especially as they balance security with ease of use
xe ccompanies have to ensure user friendliness of their devices because that xe their major selling point xe said tavish vaidya researcher at georgetown he wrote one of the first papers on audio attacks which he titled xe ccocaine noodles xe because devices interpreted the phrase xe ccocaine noodles xe as xe co google xe
mr carlini said he was confident that in time he and his colleagues could mount successful adversarial attacks against any smart device system on the market
xe cwe want to demonstrate that it xe possible xe he said xe cand then hope that other people will say xe this is possible now let xe try and fix it xe xe

san francisco xe google has been using artificial intelligence to build other artificially intelligent systems for the last several months
now the company plans to sell this kind of xe cautomated machine learning xe technology to other businesses across the globe on wednesday google introduced cloud computing service that it bills as way to build so called computer vision system that suits your particular needs xe even if you have little or no experience with the concepts that drive it
if you are radiologist for example you can use ct scans to automatically train computer algorithm that identifies signs of lung cancer if you run real estate website you can build an algorithm that distinguishes between living rooms and kitchens bathrooms and bedrooms
at least that is the pitch xe cyou don xe need ph in machine learning xe said diane greene who oversees google xe cloud computing group xe cbut you can still build highly accurate machine learning model xe
like many of the world xe largest internet companies in recent years google has begun relying on machine learning xe computer algorithms that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing large amounts of data these include systems that learn to recognize commands spoken into smartphones or translate one language into another they also include algorithms that learn to build other machine learning systems
google uses the technique while building systems that can recognize faces products landmarks and other objects in photos in some cases these algorithms are more accurate than something that is designed solely by engineers
the new service is part of widespread effort to expand the power of modern to businesses that are largely unfamiliar with this rapidly evolving technology like google new york start up called clarifai offers an online service that helps customers train computer vision algorithms
at the same time several other start ups like boston xe datarobot and silicon valley xe ai offer services designed to help businesses analyze the way products customers markets and employees behaved in the past and predict how they will perform in the future
xe cthey aim to automate data science in general xe said randy olson data scientist at life epigenetics company in portland ore
tech giants like google amazon and microsoft have hired large portion of the people who specialize in the machine learning techniques that are rapidly accelerating the progress of xe community of only researchers worldwide according to one estimate that means most businesses don xe have the talent needed to explore the latest machine learning
the question is whether these new services will work as advertised and how rapidly they will evolve in the years to come
google amazon microsoft and others already offer cloud computing services that let businesses add existing machine learning algorithms to their own products company can take microsoft computer vision algorithm for example and slip it into new smartphone app
but with its new service google goes step further providing an automated way for businesses to build new algorithms businesses can upload their own images provide list of objects pictured in these images and train their own computer vision systems tackling tasks that aren xe necessarily handled by existing technology according to google
initially google will open this service only to small group of businesses google product manager rajen sheth said the company would work with these customers to determine the price
risto miikkulainen professor of computer science at the university of texas at austin who has long explored the kind of technology that underpins google xe new service agreed that it had the potential to help other businesses build their own
xe cit is really powerful technology xe said mr miikkulainen who is also vice president of research at sentient technologies
but sometimes there is no substitute for good old human labor with google xe new service humans must label the data before the system can learn from it google can provide the human labelers as do companies like crowdflower
and even when an online service successfully automates task it xe not necessarily worth using
james bradley and his london company nmt vision once used clarifai to train and operate algorithms to identify websites that are selling products that infringe on copyrights but he and his company now handle this on their own mainly because the cost is lower
services like datarobot and ai may bill themselves as automated data scientists but here too automation has its limits xe cthese services are only as good as their parts xe said patrick dougherty data scientist with the seattle based firm slalom consulting xe cand humans still supply some of the parts xe
google says that once images are labeled its new service operates without human involvement in matter of minutes it can retrain an existing algorithm using the customer xe images given more time it can build model from scratch specifically for the problem at hand
if you are zoologist who wants an algorithm that identifies jaguars and giraffes said fei fei li chief scientist inside the google cloud group all you have to do is supply the right images xe cyou upload jaguars and giraffes xe she said xe cand you are done xe
all that remains is determining how well it works

while artificial intelligence touches so much of what we do today the current thinking behind is too limited to reach xe potential we need to think beyond what it does for search social media security and shopping xe and beyond making things merely xe csmarter xe
instead we should imagine how can be both smart and compassionate combination that can solve the most important human problems good design can lead the way by infusing an approach centered around the user and the real needs that can address
we should be thinking about in new contexts xe the newborn of the overworked parent the cancer patient who needs round the clock attention and the child with learning and behavioral difficulties holds great promise for them in combination with design that is empathic and follows few principles
first good design should help without intruding must free our attention rather than take it away and it must enhance human connection and abilities rather than replace humans great design can create interfaces that fit discreetly and seamlessly into users xe lives solving problems without creating distraction
second good design can bring xe benefits to those who otherwise might be left out that so much of is currently directed at the affluent contradicts the notion that good design can serve everyone regardless of age condition or economic background we should take the xe ca for all xe approach and it should follow human need designers and researchers should work together in the early stages of design to identify those needs develop that responds compassionately to human demands and use design to ensure cost effective accessible enabled products and services
third should never create emotional dependence we see this danger in social media where traps users in echo chambers and emotional deserts thoughtful design can create experiences that evolve with the user to continuously serve their needs the combination of good and good design can ultimately create products that help people live healthier longer and happier lives
this is not purely utopian vision it is achievable developers must recognize that while they can do important valuable work for range of commercial products and consumers the most meaningful will touch those with greater needs and lack of access the result will mean well designed products and experiences that tackle real needs with the power to improve not complicate human lives

artificial intelligence offers new hope for addressing challenges that seem intractable today from poverty to climate change to disease as tool could help us build future characterized by better health limitless scientific discovery shared prosperity and the fulfillment of human potential at the same time there xe growing awareness that innovation can have unintended consequences and valid concern that not enough is being done to anticipate and address them
yet for optimists this increasing attention to risks shouldn xe be cause for discouragement or exasperation rather it xe an important catalyst for thinking about the kind of world we want to live in xe question technologists and broader society must answer together
throughout history few if any societal transformations have been preceded by so much scrutiny and speculation about all the ways they could go wrong sense of urgency about the risks of from unintended outcomes to unintentional bias is appropriate it xe also helpful despite impressive breakthroughs systems are still relatively nascent our ambition should be not only to realize their potential but to do so safely
alongside vital public and political conversations there xe plenty of technical work to be done too already some of the world xe brightest technological minds are channeling their talent into developing in line with society xe highest ethical values
for example as more people and institutions use systems in everyday life interpretability xe whether an system can explain how it reaches decision xe is critical it xe one of the major open challenges for the field and one that xe energizing researchers across the world
recent research collaboration between deepmind and london xe moorfields eye hospital demonstrated system that not only recommended the correct referral decision for over eye diseases with percent accuracy but also crucially presented visual map that showed doctors how its conclusions were reached
meanwhile researchers at berkeley have been studying how humans can make sense of robot behavior and in turn develop ways for robots to signal their intentions team at openai has developed approaches for interpretable communication among humans and computers others at deepmind have been working on xe ctheory of mind xe xe the ability to model what drives other systems xe actions and behaviors including beliefs and intentions
these are just early examples of progress much more must be done including deeper collaborations between scientists ethicists sociologists and others optimism should never give way to complacency but the fact that more energy and funding is being invested into this kind of fundamental research is positive sign after all these challenges are as complex as important and should be as prestigious as the many other impressive achievements in the field to date
awareness of risks can also be call to action it xe precisely because technology has been the subject of so many hopes and fears that we have an unprecedented chance to shape it for the common good

we stand on the cusp of revolution the engineers tell us new gene editing techniques especially in combination with artificial intelligence technologies promise unprecedented new capacities to manipulate biological nature xe including human nature itself the potential could hardly be greater whole categories of disease conquered radically personalized medicine and drastically extended mental and physical prowess
however at the berggruen institute we believe that strictly engineering conceptions of these new technologies are not enough to grasp the significance of these potential changes
so profound is the potential impact of these technologies that they challenge the very definition of what it is to be human seen in this light the development and deployment of these technologies represent practical experiment in the philosophical today conducted primarily by engineers and scientists but we need broader conversation
for millenniums western philosophy took for granted the absolute distinction between the living and the nonliving between nature and artifice between non sentient and sentient beings we presumed that we xe we humans xe were the only thinking things in world of mere things subjects in world of objects we believed that human nature whatever it may be was fundamentally stable
but now the engineers are designing machines they say will think sense feel cogitate and reflect and even have sense of self bioengineers are contending that bacteria plants animals and even humans can be radically remade and modified this means that the traditional distinctions between man and machine as between humans and nature xe distinctions that have underpinned western philosophy religion and even political institutions xe no longer hold in sum and gene editing promise or is it threaten to redefine what counts as human and what it means to be human philosophically as well as poetically and politically
the questions posed by these experiments are the most profound possible will we use these technologies to better ourselves or to divide or even destroy humanity these technologies should allow us to live longer and healthier lives but will we deploy them in ways that also allow us to live more harmoniously with each other will these technologies encourage the play of our better angels or exacerbate our all too human tendencies toward greed jealousy and social hierarchy who should be included in conversations about how these technologies will be developed who will have decision rights over how these technologies are distributed and deployed just few people just few countries
to address these questions the berggruen institute is building transnational networks of philosophers technologists policy makers artists who are thinking about how and gene editing are transfiguring what it means to be human we seek to develop tools for navigating the most fundamental questions not just about what sort of world we can build but what sort of world we should build xe xe and also avoid building if and biotechnology deliver even half of what the visionaries believe is in store then we can no longer defer the question of what sort of human beings we want to be both as individuals and as collective

my journey into the world of artificial intelligence began when befriended bina xe an advanced social robot that is black and female like me the videotaped results of our meetings form an ongoing project called xe cconversations with bina xe our interactions raised many questions about the algorithmically negotiated world now being constructed they also pushed my art practice into focused thought and advocacy around as it relates to black people xe and other non dominant cultures xe in world already governed by systems that often offer us both too little and overly focused attention
because is no single thing it xe difficult to speak to its overarching promise but questions abound what happens when an insular subset of society encodes governing systems intended for use by the majority of the planet what happens when those writing the rules xe in this case we will call it code xe might not know care about or deliberately consider the needs desires or traditions of people their work impacts what happens if the codemaking decisions are disproportionately informed by biased data systemic injustice and misdeeds committed to preserving wealth xe cfor the good of the people xe
am reminded that the authors of the declaration of independence small group of white men said to be acting on behalf of the nation did not extend rights and privileges to folks like me xe mainly black people and women laws and code operate similarly to protect the rights of those who write them worry that development xe which is reliant on the privileges of whiteness men and money xe cannot produce an mediated world of trust and compassion that serves the global majority in an equitable inclusive and accountable manner people of color in particular can xe afford to consume as mere algorithmic systems those creating must realize that systems that work for the betterment of people who are not at the table are good and systems that collaborate with and hire those missing from the table xe are even better
is already quietly reshaping systems of trust industry government justice medicine and indeed personhood ultimately we must consider whether will magnify and perpetuate existing injustice or will we enter new era of computationally augmented humans working amicably beside self driven partners the answer of course depends on our willingness to dislodge the stubborn civil rights transgressions and prejudices that divide us after all xe and its related technologies xe carry the foibles of their makers
presents the challenge of reckoning with our skewed histories while working to counterbalance our biases and genuinely recognizing ourselves in each other this is an opportunity to expand xe rather than further homogenize xe what it means to be human through and alongside technologies this implies changes in many systems education government labor and protest to name few all are opportunities if we the people demand them and our leaders are brave enough to take them on

each week technology reporters and columnists from the new york times review the week xe news offering analysis and maybe joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry want this newsletter in your inbox sign up here
hello everyone xe natasha singer your data privacy correspondent devote most of my waking hours to delving into the consequences of digital technologies for society and democracy even spent my summer vacation teaching tech innovation ethics course for high schoolers attending the school of the new york times our precollege program
so it was quite something for me just trying to keep up with all the developments of the week
to recap microsoft said monday that it had found and shut down fraudulent sites that were imitating those of two conservative american think tanks that promote democracy the phony sites which were created by hackers linked to russian military intelligence unit indicated that the kremlin was widening its attacks beyond deceiving voters my colleagues david sanger and sheera frenkel wrote
then on tuesday facebook said it had identified and purged fraudulent accounts pages and groups that were trying to spread disinformation this time the campaigns were aimed at tricking people not just in the united states but also in britain latin america and the middle east and in addition to russia there was new misinformation culprit on facebook xe radar iran
my colleagues kate conger and sheera reported that facebook had been tipped off to the iranian fraud by fireeye cybersecurity firm in riveting article they described how cybersecurity companies are expanding their focus from trying to thwart more traditional hacking of people xe accounts to policing social media networks for pernicious influence campaigns
on wednesday alex stamos facebook xe former security chief also weighed in with post on the lawfare blog calling on the american government to step up its cybersecurity efforts and curb foreign election meddling
xe camerica xe adversaries xe he wrote xe cbelieve that it is still both safe and effective to attack democracy using american technologies and the freedoms we cherish xe
this is the argument that facebook has made all along that xe cbad actors xe as facebook xe chief operating officer sheryl sandberg termed them have weaponized our well intentioned technologies against us
but facebook and other social networks are inherently designed for virality and that has enabled domestic political campaigns xe not just foreign evildoers xe to use facebook to sow division and spread disinformation with astonishing scale and speed

at least not for decades to come sorry mark zuckerberg
by gary marcus and ernest davis
dr marcus is professor of psychology and neural science dr davis is professor of computer science
in his testimony before congress this year mark zuckerberg the chief executive of facebook addressed concerns about the strategically disseminated misinformation known as fake news that may have affected the outcome of the presidential election have no fear he assured congress solution was on its way xe if not next year then at least xe cover five to year period xe
the solution artificial intelligence mr zuckerberg xe vision which the committee members seemed to accept was that soon enough facebook xe programs would be able to detect fake news distinguishing it from more reliable information on the platform
with midterms approaching along with the worrisome prospect that fake news could once again influence our elections we wish we could say we share mr zuckerberg xe optimism but in the near term we don xe find his vision plausible decades from now it may be possible to automate the detection of fake news but doing so would require number of major advances in taking us far beyond what has so far been invented
as mr zuckerberg has acknowledged today xe operates at the xe ckeyword xe level flagging word patterns and looking for statistical correlations among them and their sources this can be somewhat useful statistically speaking certain patterns of language may indeed be associated with dubious stories for instance for long period most articles that included the words xe cbrad xe xe cangelina xe and xe cdivorce xe turned out to be unreliable tabloid fare likewise certain sources may be associated with greater or lesser degrees of factual veracity the same account deserves more credence if it appears in the wall street journal than in the national enquirer
but none of these kinds of correlations reliably sort the true from the false in the end brad pitt and angelina jolie did get divorced keyword associations that might help you one day can fool you the next
to get handle on what automated fake news detection would require consider an article posted in may on the far right website worldnetdaily or wnd the article reported that decision to admit girls gays and lesbians to the boy scouts had led to requirement that condoms be available at its xe cglobal gathering xe key passage consists of the following four sentences
the boy scouts have decided to accept people who identify as gay and lesbian among their ranks and girls are welcome now too into the iconic organization which has renamed itself scouts bsa so what xe next mandate that condoms be made available to xe all participants xe of its global gathering
was this account true or false investigators at the fact checking site snopes determined that the report was xe cmostly false xe but determining how it went afoul is subtle business beyond the dreams of even the best current
first of all there is no telltale set of phrases xe cboy scouts xe and xe cgay and lesbian xe for example have appeared together in many true reports before then there is the source wnd though notorious for promoting conspiracy theories publishes and aggregates legitimate news as well finally sentence by sentence there are lot of true facts in the passage condoms have indeed been available at the global gathering that scouts attend and the boy scouts organization has indeed come to accept girls as well as gays and lesbians into its ranks
what makes the article xe cmostly false xe is that it implies causal connection that doesn xe exist it strongly suggests that the inclusion of gays and lesbians and girls led to the condom policy xe cso what xe next xe but in truth the condom policy originated in or even earlier and so had nothing to do with the inclusion of gays lesbians or girls which happened over just the past few years
causal relationships are where contemporary machine learning techniques start to stumble in order to flag the wnd article as deceptive an program would have to understand the causal implication of xe cwhat xe next xe recognize that the account implies that the condom policy was changed recently and know to search for information that is not supplied about when the various policies were introduced
understanding the significance of the passage would also require understanding multiple viewpoints from the perspective of the international organization for scouts making condoms available at global gathering of to hormone laden adolescents is prudent public health measure from the point of view of wnd the availability of condoms like the admission of girls gays and lesbians to the boy scouts is sign that hallowed institution has been corrupted
we are not aware of any system or prototype that can sort among the various facts involved in those four sentences let alone discern the relevant implicit attitudes
most current systems that process language are oriented around different set of problems translation programs for example are primarily interested in problem of correspondence xe which french phrase say is the best parallel of given english phrase but determining that someone is implying by kind of moral logic that the boy scouts xe policy of inclusion led to condoms being supplied to scouts isn xe simple matter of checking claim against database of facts
existing systems that have been built to comprehend news accounts are extremely limited such system might be able to look at the passage from the wnd article and answer question whose answer is given directly and explicitly in the story xe cdoes the boy scouts organization accept people who identify as gay and lesbian xe but such systems rarely go much further lacking robust mechanism for drawing inferences or way of connecting to body of broader knowledge as eduardo ari xc xb de la rubia data scientist at facebook told us for now xe ca cannot fundamentally tell what xe true or false xe this is skill much better suited to humans xe
to get to where mr zuckerberg wants to go will require the development of fundamentally new paradigm one in which the goal is not to detect statistical trends but to uncover ideas and the relations between them only then will such promises about become reality rather than science fiction

mr latiff is retired air force major general
in the united states army research laboratory published report predicting what the battlefield of would look like not surprisingly it was scenario largely driven by technology and the report described sort of warfare most people associate with video games or science fiction movies xe combined forces of augmented or enhanced humans robots operating in swarms laser weapons intelligence systems and cyberbots fighting in highly contested information environment using spoofing hacking misinformation and other means of electronic warfare
in one sense this is nothing new the way wars are fought have always changed with technology but humans themselves don xe change so rapidly as retired air force major general with special interests in both technology and military ethics have specific concern that as new weapons technologies make soldiering more lethal our soldiers will find it more difficult than ever to behave ethically and to abide by the long established conventions regarding the rules of war
as the nation with the most powerful military on earth we are obligated to acknowledge these profound fundamental changes in the experience of soldiering to confront them and to prepare to adapt
on battlefields of the past killing was intentional and intensely personal in the future the automated nature of combat the artificial enhancement of soldiers and the speed and distances involved will threaten to undermine the warrior ethos this applies not only to conduct between opposing soldiers but among those fighting on the same side as well in the past soldiers took risks for one another it is not at all clear how the introduction of autonomous machines will change that dynamic would soldier be willing to entrust his life to machine would fellow soldier put his life or the lives of other soldiers in danger to save an important robot should he
many soldiers will no longer have to fear close contact and hand to hand combat because they will be able to deploy robots and unmanned vehicles at great ranges however fear acts as modulator of behavior and by reducing it we will likely also remove constraints on unethical behavior if soldier cannot see hear and understand the context of battlefield or particular engagement he is less likely to concern himself with decisions requiring such nuance
perhaps machine can make utilitarian calculation on proportionality of force but can it make an empathetic decision would it be able to sense an enemy xe wavering determination for instance and call off an attack to prevent unnecessary loss of life commanders and troops on the ground in contact with an enemy have xe cfeel xe for the complexities of the battlefield that cannot be reproduced by machine
computers artificial intelligence robots and autonomous systems will create an environment too complex and fast for humans to keep up with much less control
increasingly warfare will exceed the capacity of the human senses to collect and process data department of defense policy on autonomy in weapons systems says human will always be part of the decision making for lethal weapons but the pentagon nonetheless spent billion in on artificial intelligence and every military service is funding work in autonomous systems in the defense department expects to spend billion on unmanned systems with over million for autonomy human machine teaming and swarm research
gradually perhaps imperceptibly automated systems will function so much more efficiently that humans will become mere bystanders the soldier will become the slowest element in an engagement or will simply become irrelevant adherence to the rules of war will become less relevant as well
separate set of ethical questions are raised by the technologies of human xe cenhancement xe and augmentation which include improving physical strength stamina and pain tolerance as well as using neurological implants and stimulation to restore brain function and enhance learning
can soldiers under the influence of behavior modifying drugs or electronics be held to account for their actions if the soldier is using drugs to enhance his cognition or reduce his fear what is the role of free will might soldier who fears nothing unnecessarily place himself his unit or innocent bystanders at risk what about the impact of memory altering drugs on the soldier xe sense of guilt which might be important in decisions about unnecessary and superfluous suffering
these are important decisions in war and they form the basis for many of the tenets of xe cjust war xe theory gen paul selva the vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff supports xe ckeeping the ethical rules of war in place lest we unleash on humanity set of robots that we don xe know how to control xe
the role of revising and recasting these conventions should be taking place at the highest levels of government so far it hasn xe the white house xe select committee on artificial intelligence formed in may has not even acknowledged the major ethical issues surrounding that have been very publicly raised by an increasing number of scientists and technology experts like elon musk bill gates and stephen hawking
while it is important that leaders openly recognize the critical nature of these issues the department of defense needs to follow up on its directive on autonomy with guidelines for researchers and commanders it should require that both researchers and military commanders question xe throughout the development process and long before the systems are ready for deployment xe how the systems will be used and whether that use might violate any of laws of armed conflict and international humanitarian law
historically the united states has led the world in technology development and thus our use of questionable weapons or methods will be well noted by others sadly in the period after the sept attacks the united states resorted to torture of enemy detainees while most senior leaders have denounced the practice the fact remains that the nation crossed an important moral threshold knowing that future enemies xe even civilized ones xe may be less inhibited in employing the same methods against us the same will be true for advanced technologies
with new warfare technologies we now have an opportunity to again demonstrate our leadership in human rights by ensuring that our young soldiers know how to use the new weapons in ethical and humane ways

in new tests amazon xe system had more difficulty identifying the gender of female and darker skinned faces than similar services from ibm and microsoft
deborah raji college student helped joy buolamwini of the media lab test facial technologies from amazon ibm microsoft face and kairos credit credit jaime hogge for the new york times

by natasha singer
over the last two years amazon has aggressively marketed its facial recognition technology to police departments and federal agencies as service to help law enforcement identify suspects more quickly it has done so as another tech giant microsoft has called on congress to regulate the technology arguing that it is too risky for companies to oversee on their own
now new study from researchers at the media lab has found that amazon xe system rekognition had much more difficulty in telling the gender of female faces and of darker skinned faces in photos than similar services from ibm and microsoft the results raise questions about potential bias that could hamper amazon xe drive to popularize the technology
in the study published thursday rekognition made no errors in recognizing the gender of lighter skinned men but it misclassified women as men percent of the time the researchers said and mistook darker skinned women for men percent of the time microsoft xe technology mistook darker skinned women for men just percent of the time
study published year ago found similar problems in the programs built by ibm microsoft and megvii an artificial intelligence company in china known as face those results set off an outcry that was amplified when co author of the study joy buolamwini posted youtube videos showing the technology misclassifying famous african american women like michelle obama as men
the companies in last year xe report all reacted by quickly releasing more accurate technology for the latest study ms buolamwini said she sent letter with some preliminary results to amazon seven months ago but she said that she hadn xe heard back from amazon and that when she and co author retested the company xe product couple of months later it had not improved
matt wood general manager of artificial intelligence at amazon web services said the researchers had examined facial analysis xe technology that can spot features such as mustaches or expressions such as smiles xe and not facial recognition technology that can match faces in photos or video stills to identify individuals amazon markets both services
xe cit xe not possible to draw conclusion on the accuracy of facial recognition for any use case xe including law enforcement xe based on results obtained using facial analysis xe dr wood said in statement he added that the researchers had not tested the latest version of rekognition which was updated in november
amazon said that in recent internal tests using an updated version of its service the company found no difference in accuracy in classifying gender across all ethnicities
with advancements in artificial intelligence facial technologies xe services that can be used to identify people in crowds analyze their emotions or detect their age and facial characteristics xe are proliferating now as companies begin to market these services more aggressively for uses like policing and vetting job candidates they have emerged as lightning rod in the debate about whether and how congress should regulate powerful emerging technologies
the new study scheduled to be presented monday at an artificial intelligence and ethics conference in honolulu is sure to inflame that argument
proponents see facial recognition as an important advance in helping law enforcement agencies catch criminals and find missing children some police departments and the federal bureau of investigation have tested amazon xe product
but civil liberties experts warn that it can also be used to secretly identify people xe potentially chilling americans xe ability to speak freely or simply go about their business anonymously in public
over the last year amazon has come under intense scrutiny by federal lawmakers the american civil liberties union shareholders employees and academic researchers for marketing rekognition to law enforcement agencies that is partly because unlike microsoft ibm and other tech giants amazon has been less willing to publicly discuss concerns
amazon citing customer confidentiality has also declined to answer questions from federal lawmakers about which government agencies are using rekognition or how they are using it the company xe responses have further troubled some federal lawmakers
xe cnot only do want to see them address our concerns with the sense of urgency it deserves xe said representative jimmy gomez california democrat who has been investigating amazon xe facial recognition practices xe cbut also want to know if law enforcement is using it in ways that violate civil liberties and what xe if any xe protections amazon has built into the technology to protect the rights of our constituents xe
in letter last month to mr gomez amazon said rekognition customers must abide by amazon xe policies which require them to comply with civil rights and other laws but the company said that for privacy reasons it did not audit customers giving it little insight into how its product is being used
the study published last year reported that microsoft had perfect score in identifying the gender of lighter skinned men in photo database but that it misclassified darker skinned women as men about one in five times ibm and face had an even higher error rate each misclassifying the gender of darker skinned women about one in three times
ms buolamwini said she had developed her methodology with the idea of harnessing public pressure and market competition to push companies to fix biases in their software that could pose serious risks to people
xe cone of the things we were trying to explore with the paper was how to galvanize action xe ms buolamwini said
immediately after the study came out last year ibm published blog post xe mitigating bias in models xe citing ms buolamwini xe study in the post ruchir puri chief architect at ibm watson said ibm had been working for months to reduce bias in its facial recognition system the company post included test results showing improvements particularly in classifying the gender of darker skinned women soon after ibm released new system that the company said had tenfold decrease in error rates
few months later microsoft published its own post titled xe cmicrosoft improves facial recognition technology to perform well across all skin tones genders xe in particular the company said it had significantly reduced the error rates for female and darker skinned faces
ms buolamwini wanted to learn whether the study had changed overall industry practices so she and colleague deborah raji college student who did an internship at the media lab last summer conducted new study
in it they retested the facial systems of ibm microsoft and face they also tested the facial systems of two companies that were not included in the first study amazon and kairos start up in florida
the new study found that ibm microsoft and face all improved their accuracy in identifying gender
by contrast the study reported amazon misclassified the gender of darker skinned females percent of the time while kairos had an error rate of percent
melissa doval the chief executive of kairos said the company inspired by ms buolamwini xe work released more accurate algorithm in october
ms buolamwini said the results of her studies raised fundamental questions for society about whether facial technology should not be used in certain situations such as job interviews or in products like drones or police body cameras
some federal lawmakers are voicing similar issues
xe ctechnology like amazon xe rekognition should be used if and only if it is imbued with american values like the right to privacy and equal protection xe said senator edward markey massachusetts democrat who has been investigating amazon xe facial recognition practices xe ci do not think that standard is currently being met xe

hitchhiking robot was beheaded in hiladelphia security robot was punched to the ground in silicon valley another security bot in san francisco was covered in tarp and smeared with barbecue sauce
why do people lash out at robots particularly those that are built to resemble humans it xe global phenomenon in mall in osaka japan three boys beat humanoid robot with all their strength in moscow man attacked teaching ro bot named alantim with baseball bat kicking it to the ground while the robot pleaded for help
why do we act this way are we secretly terrified that robots will take our jobs upend our societies control our every move with their ever expanding capabilities and air of quiet malice
quite possibly the specter of insurrection is embedded in the word xe crobot xe itself it was first used to refer to automatons by the czech playwright karel capek who repurposed word that had referred to system of indentured servitude or serfdom the feudal fear of peasant revolt was transplanted to mechanical servants and worries of robot uprising have lingered ever since
the comedian aristotle georgeson has found that videos of people physically aggressing robots are among the most popular he posts on instagram under the pseudonym blake webber and much of the feedback he gets tends to reflect the fear of robot uprisings
mr georgeson said that some commenters approve of the robot beatings xe csaying we should be doing this so they can never rise up but there xe this whole other group that says we shouldn xe be doing this because when they xe xe the robots xe xe csee these videos they xe re going to be pissed xe
but agnieszka wykowska cognitive neuroscientist researcher at the italian institute of technology and the editor in chief of the international journal of social robotics said that while human antagonism toward robots has different forms and motivations it often resembles the ways that humans hurt each other robot abuse she said might stem from the tribal psychology of insiders and outsiders
xe cyou have an agent the robot that is in different category than humans xe she said xe cso you probably very easily engage in this psychological mechanism of social ostracism because it xe an out group member that xe something to discuss the dehumanization of robots even though they xe re not humans xe
paradoxically our tendency to dehumanize robots comes from the instinct to anthropomorphize them william santana li the chief executive of knightscope the largest provider of security robots in the united states two of which were battered in san francisco said that while he avoids treating his products as if they were sentient beings his clients seem unable to help themselves xe cour clients significant majority end up naming the machines themselves xe he said xe cthere xe holmes and watson there xe rosie there xe steve there xe cb there xe cx po xe
ms wykowska said that cruelty that results from this anthropomorphizing might reflect xe cfrankenstein syndrome xe because xe cwe are afraid of this thing that we don xe really fully understand because it xe little bit similar to us but not quite enough xe
in his paper xe cwho is afraid of the humanoid xe fr xc xa xc xa ric kaplan he digital humanities chair at xc cole polytechnique xc xa xc xa rale de lausanne in switzerland suggested that westerners have been taught to see themselves as biologically infor med machines xe and perhaps are unable to separate the idea of humanity from vision of machines the nervous system could only be understood after the discovery of electricity he wrote dna is necessarily explained as an analog to computer code and the human heart is often understood as mechanical pump at every turn mr kaplan wrote xe cwe see ourselves in the mirror of the machines that we can build xe
this doesn xe explain human destruction of less humanoid machines dozens of vigilantes have thrown rocks at driverless cars arizona for example and incident reports from san francisco suggest that human dr ivers are intentionally crashing into driverless cars these robot altercations may have more to do with fear of unemployment or with vengeance paper published last year by economists at and boston university suggested that each robot that is added to discreet zone of economic activity xe creduces employment by about six workers xe blue collar occupations were particularly hit hard and self driving car killed woman in tempe ariz in march which at least one man brandishing rifle cited as the reason for his dislike of the machines
abuse of humanoid robots can be disturbing and expensive but there may be solution said ms wykowska the neuroscientist she described colleague in the field of social robotics telling story recently about robots being introduced to kindergarten class he said that xe ckids have this tendency of being very brutal to the robot they would kick the robot they would be cruel to it they would be really not nice xe she recalled
xe cthat went on until the point that the caregiver started giving names to the robots so the robots suddenly were not just robots but andy joe and sally at that moment the brutal behavior stopped so its very interesting because again its sort of like giving name to the robot immediately puts it little closer to the in group xe
mr li shared similar experience when asked about the poor treatment that had befallen some of knightscope xe security robots xe cthe easiest thing for us to do is when we go to new place the first day before we even unload the machine is town hall lunch and learn xe he said xe ccome meet the robot have some cake some naming contest and have rational conversation about what the machine does and doesn xe do and after you do that all is good percent xe

the auto industry has choice to make which language will cars speak when they talk to one another
until couple of years ago automakers agreed on one vehicle to vehicle communications platform called dedicated short range communications or dsrc based on the technology used for wi fi but some car companies have begun to favor competing protocol known as cellular which is based on next generation version of the technology used by your mobile phone
so far the federal government has held back on enforcing standard proposed rule mandating deployment of dsrc equipment in new vehicles has languished for nearly two years and critics say the delay is making motorists less safe but supporters of the competing standard say something better has come along
xe cyou xe ve got public agencies who want to deploy but we don xe have standard so what do buy xe asked kirk steudle director of michigan xe department of transportation and supporter of the dsrc standard xe cbetamax or vhs xe
it is crucial technological choice cars are increasingly connected and the autonomous vehicles that will arrive in the future must have way to communicate with each other and surrounding infrastructure but even before self driving cars hit the streets en masse there are enormous benefits to be had federal transportation officials estimate that once widely deployed such communication systems will prevent or mitigate up to percent of all non impaired collisions and address thousands of fatal crashes per year in the united states
the auto industry is divided over the standards
general motors has embraced dsrc and it xe already standard safety feature on cadillac cts sedans toyota and volkswagen have also committed to make dsrc systems standard equipment on new cars beginning next year on the other side are brands including ford bmw and mercedes benz that have joined the chip maker qualcomm cellular providers and others to form the automotive association which is pushing the standard
regardless of the standard that xe settled on vehicles will be able to directly communicate with one another allowing them to warn of collisions even when drivers cannot see each other and such systems will allow valuable safety information to be shared from other sources instead of sign warning that xe cbridge ices before road xe the bridge can warn drivers when ice has actually formed and traffic lights will be able to manage traffic to minimize delays and clear the way for emergency vehicles
but there are important differences
dsrc has been around much longer and most car companies have developed and tested systems based on the standard the federal communications commission ruled that chunk of the wireless radio spectrum would be restricted to the dsrc standard beginning in and in the obama administration proposed rule that would mandate phase in of dsrc in new cars and light trucks starting in the national highway traffic safety administration said systems to prevent collisions at intersections alone could save some lives year
john kenney director of the toyota infotechnology center said his company was ready to move ahead with the dsrc standard xe cg is online too xe he said xe cnow there xe potential risk that maybe it xe not going to be dsrc that just impedes deployment xe
supporters of the standard contend that dsrc is nearly two decades old from time when companies didn xe imagine streaming video to children in the back seat of crossover or updating vehicle operating systems from the cloud xe advocates say it would allow for more features be more flexible and could use cellular infrastructure
xe cpeople assume that just because something is here now and they xe ve been working on it for or years it will be here years from now xe said jovan zagajac technology manager in ford xe connected vehicle and services group and member of the group xe board xe cwell the world has changed xe
bmw xe engineers for example see safety advantages if cars can communicate directly with personal devices like mobile phones
xe cthis will make it much easier to retrofit vehicles and also give the benefits of to other vulnerable road users such as cyclists and pedestrians xe said joachim goethel the leader of bmw xe connectivity initiatives
the division runs deep this month the eno center for transportation nonprofit established by william phelps eno the road safety pioneer whose work led to new york city xe first traffic plan in published dueling opinion pieces on the standards one was from toyota official supporting dsrc and the other from daimler official favoring
despite the obama era proposal which would require all new vehicles to include dsrc by the federal government hasn xe moved to enforce standard
heidi king deputy administrator at the national highway traffic safety administration said the department of transportation was xe ctechnology neutral xe on communication protocols
xe cwhile our past research has centered around dsrc xe because that was the only technology available xe we are also exploring other technologies including cellular xe she said in an email
the federal government also has authority over crucial element of any system the radio frequency on which it operates two members of the federal communications commission recently informed toyota that the agency was looking at xe cnewer technology xe xe such as xe for the gigahertz band that has been allocated to dsrc
xe cby taking modern look at the possibilities for wireless services in the ghz band we can support automobile safety increase spectrum for wi fi and grow the wireless economy xe they wrote in letter to the carmaker
the mention of xe cthe wireless economy xe hints at another crucial difference between the standards dsrc has little possibility for monetization while cellular system offers the possibility of revenue streams through additional data services the automotive association suggests that next generation infotainment services used by xe such as movie streaming or conference calls xe would improve the passenger experience
car and equipment makers have conducted trials of but even its proponents acknowledge that it will take time to roll out while dsrc is market ready it xe not just automakers that now have to wrestle with the choice state transportation departments and many local authorities have been installing dsrc compatible roadside infrastructure for almost decade
in january state and regional transportation officials including mr steudle of michigan formed the coalition for safety sooner to advocate the protection of the ghz band for dsrc and the acceleration of efforts to deploy it
the group pressed its case in letter to transportation secretary elaine chao ajit pai the chairman of the federal communications commission and mick mulvaney the director of the office of management and budget the signatories had already installed or committed to install more than dsrc equipped intersections and roadside units and outfitted thousands of their own vehicles with the technology
xe cwaiting for the next technology solution to be developed tested and proven misses huge opportunity to potentially save tens of thousands of lives throughout the united states each year xe they wrote
recent study published by the university of michigan transportation research institute calculated the cost of waiting to deploy vehicle to vehicle systems three year delay will allow the sale of millions of new cars and light trucks without them and those vehicles will remain on the road for an average of years during that time they would have millions of avoidable collisions according to the study which was written by james sayer the institute xe director and two other researchers
the institute helped with one of the first and largest tests of dsrc technology in ann arbor mich involving some vehicles based in part on that experience michigan officials require dsrc compatible hardware in every new traffic signal in the state
mr steudle the michigan transportation director said the federal government ought to get involved
xe cthey should take direction as opposed to saying they xe re agnostic to technology xe he said xe cthat xe how we got into this mess we have today xe

of the many small humiliations heaped on young oncologist in his final year of fellowship perhaps this one carried the oddest bite year old black and white cat named oscar was apparently better than most doctors at predicting when terminally ill patient was about to die the story appeared astonishingly in the new england journal of medicine in the summer of adopted as kitten by the medical staff oscar reigned over one floor of the steere house nursing home in rhode island when the cat would sniff the air crane his neck and curl up next to man or woman it was sure sign of impending demise the doctors would call the families to come in for their last visit over the course of several years the cat had curled up next to patients every one of them died shortly thereafter
no one knows how the cat acquired his formidable death sniffing skills perhaps oscar xe nose learned to detect some unique whiff of death xe chemicals released by dying cells say perhaps there were other inscrutable signs didn xe quite believe it at first but oscar xe acumen was corroborated by other physicians who witnessed the prophetic cat in action as the author of the article wrote xe cno one dies on the third floor unless oscar pays visit and stays awhile xe
the story carried particular resonance for me that summer for had been treating year old plumber with esophageal cancer he had responded well to chemotherapy and radiation and we had surgically resected his esophagus leaving no detectable trace of malignancy in his body one afternoon few weeks after his treatment had been completed cautiously broached the topic of end of life care we were going for cure of course told but there was always the small possibility of relapse he had young wife and two children and mother who had brought him weekly to the chemo suite perhaps suggested he might have frank conversation with his family about his goals
but demurred he was regaining strength week by week the conversation was bound to be xe ca bummah xe as he put it in his distinct boston accent his spirits were up the cancer was out why rain on his celebration agreed reluctantly it was unlikely that the cancer would return
when the relapse appeared it was full on deluge two months after he left the hospital returned to see me with sprays of metastasis in his liver his lungs and unusually in his bones the pain from these lesions was so terrifying that only the highest doses of painkilling drugs would treat it and spent the last weeks of his life in state bordering on coma unable to register the presence of his family around his bed his mother pleaded with me at first to give him more chemo then accused me of misleading the family about xe prognosis held my tongue in shame doctors knew have an abysmal track record of predicting which of our patients are going to die death is our ultimate black box
in survey led by researchers at university college london of over prognoses of the life span of terminally ill patients the hits and misses were wide ranging some doctors predicted deaths accurately others underestimated death by nearly three months yet others overestimated it by an equal magnitude even within oncology there were subcultures of the worst offenders in one story likely apocryphal leukemia doctor was found instilling chemotherapy into the veins of man whose monitor said that his heart had long since stopped
but what if an algorithm could predict death in late graduate student named anand avati at stanford xe computer science department along with small team from the medical school tried to xe cteach xe an algorithm to identify patients who were very likely to die within defined time window xe cthe palliative care team at the hospital had challenge xe avati told me xe chow could we find patients who are within three to months of dying xe this window was xe cthe sweet spot of palliative care xe lead time longer than months can strain limited resources unnecessarily providing too much too soon in contrast if death came less than three months after the prediction there would be no real preparatory time for dying xe too little too late identifying patients in the narrow optimal time period avati knew would allow doctors to use medical interventions more appropriately and more humanely and if the algorithm worked palliative care teams would be relieved from having to manually scour charts hunting for those most likely to benefit
avati and his team identified about patients who could be studied the patients had all sorts of illnesses xe cancer neurological diseases heart and kidney failure the team xe key insight was to use the hospital xe medical records as proxy time machine say man died in january what if you scrolled time back to the xe csweet spot of palliative care xe xe the window between january and october when care would have been most effective but to find that spot for given patient avati knew you xe presumably need to collect and analyze medical information before that window could you gather information about this man during this prewindow period that would enable doctor to predict demise in that three to month section of time and what kinds of inputs might teach such an algorithm to make predictions
avati drew on medical information that had already been coded by doctors in the hospital patient xe diagnosis the number of scans ordered the number of days spent in the hospital the kinds of procedures done the medical prescriptions written the information was admittedly limited xe no questionnaires no conversations no sniffing of chemicals xe but it was objective and standardized across patients
these inputs were fed into so called deep neural network xe kind of software architecture thus named because it xe thought to loosely mimic the way the brain xe neurons are organized the task of the algorithm was to adjust the weights and strengths of each piece of information in order to generate probability score that given patient would die within three to months
the xe cdying algorithm xe as we might call it digested and absorbed information from nearly patients to train itself once it had ingested all the data avati xe team tested it on the remaining patients the algorithm performed surprisingly well the false alarm rate was low nine out of patients predicted to die within three to months did die within that window and percent of patients assigned low probabilities by the program survived longer than months the data used by this algorithm can be vastly refined in the future lab values scan results doctor xe note or patient xe own assessment can be added to the mix enhancing the predictive power
so what exactly did the algorithm xe clearn xe about the process of dying and what in turn can it teach oncologists here is the strange rub of such deep learning system it learns but it cannot tell us why it has learned it assigns probabilities but it cannot easily express the reasoning behind the assignment like child who learns to ride bicycle by trial and error and asked to articulate the rules that enable bicycle riding simply shrugs her shoulders and sails away the algorithm looks vacantly at us when we ask xe cwhy xe it is like death another black box
still when you pry the box open to look at individual cases you see expected and unexpected patterns one man assigned score of died within few months as predicted he had had bladder and prostate cancer had undergone scans had been hospitalized for days xe all of which had been picked up by the algorithm as signs of impending death but surprising amount of weight was seemingly put on the fact that scans were made of his spine and that catheter had been used in his spinal cord xe features that and my colleagues might not have recognized as predictors of dying an of the spinal cord later realized was most likely signaling cancer in the nervous system xe deadly site for metastasis
it xe hard for me to read about the xe cdying algorithm xe without thinking about my patient if more sophisticated version of such an algorithm had been available would have used it in his case absolutely might that have enabled the end of life conversation never had with his family yes but cannot shake some inherent discomfort with the thought that an algorithm might understand patterns of mortality better than most humans and why kept asking myself would such program seem so much more acceptable if it had come wrapped in black and white fur box that rather than emitting probabilistic outputs curled up next to us with retracted claws

start up uses visual tracking and behavioral data to operate new san francisco market which lets shoppers walk out unimpeded and sometimes mischarged
by nellie bowles
san francisco xe one recent afternoon the city xe newest grocery market was trying to figure out whether would buy steal or leave behind bag of white cheddar popcorn xe and so was
on its side cameras along the ceiling and wealth of behavioral data
on my side crippling indecision
last week san francisco got its first completely automated cashierless store standard market shoppers who have downloaded the store xe app can go into the square foot space grab items and simply leave there is no check in gate and there is no checkout swipe ceiling cameras identify the shopper and the items and determine when said items leave with said shopper or at least that xe the idea
the start up behind this operation is standard cognition which has raised million in venture capital and formed partnerships with four retail chains around the world this first market is prototype to showcase the technology and work on the bugs the ambitious goal is to add the tech in stores day each day by
five of the seven founders came from the securities and exchange commission where they built artificial intelligence software to detect fraud and trade violations before starting standard cognition in now these fraud experts are working to discern something equally complicated whether am stealing snack
standard market is the latest entry in the emerging fray of retail automation where companies are throwing cameras sensors and machine learning into grocery stores to replace the checkout line in january amazon opened its first cashierless go market in seattle to the public it has since opened more of the stores in china experiments in cashierless stores abound using radio frequency identification tags and self checkout process that involves scanning quick response code or your face
standard cognition xe approach is different it relies exclusively on the ceiling cameras and artificial intelligence software to figure out what you are buying the cameras document shoppers xe movements speed stride length and gaze the store knows when glance at poster and for how long it knows if slowed down grabbed chocolate bar and put it back it knows if my body is facing the dried mangoes but my face is set on the popcorn and it knows or is trying to know when am planning to steal
the goal is to predict and prevent shoplifting because unlike amazon xe go stores which have subway turnstile like gate for entry and exit standard market has an open door and the path is clear
xe cwe learn behaviors of what it looks like to leave xe said michael suswal standard cognition xe co founder and chief operating officer trajectory gaze and speed are especially useful for detecting theft he said adding xe cif they xe re going to steal their gait is larger and they xe re looking at the door xe
once the system decides it has detected potential theft behavior store attendant will get text and walk over for xe ca polite conversation xe mr suswal said
predicting theft requires lot of data about shoppers much of which does not exist yet xe xe cor at least no one is willing to give it to us xe he said
so few days before standard market opened standard cognition hired actors to shop there for four hours in japan the team has worked with convenience store chain whose name it has not disclosed in very useful data collection effort
standard cognition said that unlike facial recognition it did not collect biometric information possibility that has troubled privacy experts watching the technology evolve
the growth of cashierless technology could hurt the american labor force there are nearly five million retail sales workers in america but as mr suswal has pitched standard cognition xe technology he said he has found that most shop owners are not looking to replace workers instead they want their workers wandering the stores more in hopes of luring shoppers back into brick and mortar retail
xe cthey all talk about new services making shopping more fun making it worthwhile to shop offline xe mr suswal said
and they talk about data while store owner can look at receipts to see who bought generic ketchup cashierless technology can help tell if the shopper first picked up heinz bottle and how long he or she looked at it basically now an owner can see what customer did not buy
on recent friday line stretched down the street from standard market as bouncer at the door took in one shopper at time for the automated experience the store is in san francisco xe gentrifying mid market neighborhood between chanvi eatery pakistani restaurant and huckleberry bicycles high end bike shop people outside were downloading the app and typing in their credit card numbers
walking out was yoshimasa takahashi who works nearby in finance receipt popped up on his phone it said he had bought noodles and kraft macaroni amp cheese xe except he had not bought the kraft macaroni amp cheese
xe ci was playing with it but didn xe take it out xe mr takahashi said smiling at his win over the tech
the bouncer gave him refund
inside rebecca schiffman was working the floor she had been an employee at whole foods when the standard cognition team recruited her she liked the idea of getting out from behind cash register and said she was unfazed about having to intervene with potential shoplifters
xe ci used to do that all the time anyway xe she said
store hours are short for the next few weeks xe the store will be open only half days on wednesdays and fridays while the tech is tweaked for now the selection of food is extremely limited the store has only square feet devoted to food because the founders said they have not yet gotten the permits required for more so there is an odd assortment of items xe fritos apple jacks and starbucks frappuccinos xe that leans heavily toward dorm room style snacks
to shop opened my phone which flashed blue letting the store know had entered wandered throwing items into my tote then left
outside found mr suswal minute went by and notification popped up on my phone with my receipt one white cheddar popcorn and one roll of toilet paper for total of
in fact had left with two bags of popcorn had toyed with the second bag debated buying it considered my dinner plans put it back and finally took it with quick impulsive grab the system missed it
xe cthat shouldn xe happen xe mr suswal said and yet it did he shrugged and said had won it
so left with the extra cent bag of popcorn and did not feel bad really soon standard cognition and others will probably get better will perfectly detect where that snack went and my movement will be subsumed and predicted by artificial intelligence xe endless data maw
but for now it xe not quite good enough and covered in crumbs

when it comes to artificial intelligence and jobs the prognostications are grim the conventional wisdom is that might soon put millions of people out of work xe that it stands poised to do to clerical and white collar workers over the next two decades what mechanization did to factory workers over the past two and that is to say nothing of the truckers and taxi drivers who will find themselves unemployed or underemployed as self driving cars take over our roads
but it xe time we start thinking about xe potential benefits for society as well as its drawbacks the big data and revolutions could also help fight poverty and promote economic stability
poverty of course is multifaceted phenomenon but the condition of poverty often entails one or more of these realities lack of income joblessness lack of preparedness education and dependency on government services welfare can address all three
first even as threatens to put people out of work it can simultaneously be used to match them to good middle class jobs that are going unfilled today there are millions of such jobs in the united states this is precisely the kind of matching problem at which excels likewise can predict where the job openings of tomorrow will lie and which skills and training will be needed for them
historically we have tended to shy away from this kind of social planning and job matching perhaps because it smacks to us of command economy no one however is suggesting that the government should force workers to train for and accept particular jobs xe or indeed that identifying these jobs and skills gaps needs to be the work of the government the point is that we now have the tools to take the guesswork out of which jobs are available and which skills workers need to fill them
second we can bring what is known as differentiated education xe based on the idea that students master skills in different ways and at different speeds xe to every student in the country study by indian researchers found that nearly percent of medical students held strong preference for one mode of learning some were listeners others were visual learners still others learned best by doing
our school system effectively assumes precisely the opposite we bundle students into room use the same method of instruction and hope for the best can improve this state of affairs even within the context of standardized curriculum xe ctutors xe can home in on and correct for each student xe weaknesses adapt coursework to his or her learning style and keep the student engaged
today xe dominant type of also known as machine learning permits computer programs to become more accurate xe to learn if you will xe as they absorb data and correlate it with known examples from other data sets in this way the xe ctutor xe becomes increasingly effective at matching student xe needs as it spends more time seeing what works to improve performance
third concerted effort to drag education and job training and matching into the st century ought to remove the reliance of substantial portion of the population on government programs designed to assist struggling americans with st century technology we could plausibly reduce the use of government assistance services to levels where they serve the function for which they were originally intended
big data sets can now be harnessed to better predict which programs help certain people at given time and to quickly assess whether programs are having the desired effect to use an advertising analogy this would be the difference between placing commercial on prime time television and doing so through micro targeted analytics guess which one is cheaper and better able to reach the target population
as for the poisonous effect of ideology on the debate over public assistance big data promises something closer to an unbiased ideology free evaluation of the effectiveness of these social programs we could come closer to the vision of meritocratic technocratic society that politicians from both parties at state and local levels xe those closest to the practical problems their constituents face xe have begun to embrace
even congress occasionally wakes up from its partisan slumber to advance the cause of technology in public policy decision making in congress voted for and president barack obama authorized the creation of the commission on evidence based policy making the act creating the commission was sponsored by senator patty murray democrat and paul ryan the house speaker before the commission expired in september it used government data to evaluate the effectiveness of government policy and made recommendations based on its findings
this provides one more indication of the promise of and big data in the service of positive purposeful public good before we dismiss these new technologies as nothing more than agents of chaos and disruption we ought to consider their potential to work to society xe advantage

every major university is wrestling with how to adapt to the technology wave of artificial intelligence xe how to prepare students not only to harness the powerful tools of but also to thoughtfully weigh its ethical and social implications courses conferences and joint majors have proliferated in the last few years
but the massachusetts institute of technology is taking particularly ambitious step creating new college backed by planned investment of billion two thirds of the funds have already been raised said in announcing the initiative on monday
the linchpin gift of million came from stephen schwarzman chief executive of the blackstone group the big private equity firm the college called the stephen schwarzman college of computing will create new faculty positions and many more fellowships for graduate students
it is scheduled to begin in the fall semester next year housed in other buildings before moving into its own new space in
the goal of the college said rafael reif the president of is to xe ceducate the bilinguals of the future xe he defines bilinguals as people in fields like biology chemistry politics history and linguistics who are also skilled in the techniques of modern computing that can be applied to them
but he said xe cto educate bilinguals we have to create new structure xe
academic departments still tend to be silos mr reif explained despite interdisciplinary programs that cross the departmental boundaries half the faculty positions will focus on advancing computer science and the other half will be jointly appointed by the college and by other departments across
traditionally departments hold sway in hiring and tenure decisions at universities so for example researcher who applied based text analysis tools in field like history might be regarded as too much computer scientist by the humanities department and not sufficiently technical by the computer science department
xe leaders hope the new college will alter traditional academic thinking and practice
xe cwe need to rewire how we hire and promote faculty xe said martin schmidt the provost of
today most dual major programs involve taking courses in computer science department in machine learning or data science in addition to student xe major the college is an effort to have computing baked into the curriculum rather than stapled on it will grant degrees though what they will be or their names have not been determined
that appealed to melissa nobles dean of xe school of humanities arts and social sciences who said she saw the new college as helping non computer scientists bring tools to their fields xe xe cto what they really care about xe
the college ms nobles said offers the possibility of renewal for humanities studies at where students flock to computer science and engineering
xe cwe xe re excited by the possibilities xe she said xe cthat xe how the humanities are going to survive not by running from the future but by embracing it xe
donors like students are attracted more to computer science programs than to many other disciplines but the new college at is designed to spread the wealth
xe cit xe major fund raising mechanism that gives huge resource to apply to other fields xe said eric schmidt who was the executive chairman of alphabet the parent company of google and is visiting innovation fellow at
the college and its goals were shaped by long running conversation between mr schwarzman the principal donor and mr reif the president they first met in when mr schwarzman was setting up the schwarzman scholars program which awards scholarships for young people to gain greater understanding of china
at the time mr schwarzman was becoming increasingly fascinated by the debate over the opportunity and challenge presented by artificial intelligence lengthy conversation with jack ma founder of the chinese commerce giant alibaba piqued his interest mr schwarzman recalled and he kept talking to experts and reading
xe ci became convinced that this technology was so powerful it was really going to remake lot of the world as we know it xe he said
over the next few years mr schwarzman and mr reif picked up the conversation about the trajectory of and its broad impact when their paths crossed in places like new york and davos switzerland
over the past year xe leaders and faculty were brainstorming to chart course for the university xe future the university had done individual initiatives in areas like the future of work and research project on the human and machine intelligence
but mr schwarzman urged mr reif to go further emphasizing the ethical issues raised by automated decision making in everything from medical diagnosis to self driving cars he also stressed the workplace impact
xe cwe really need to try to understand this technology not just get hit by it xe mr schwarzman said
meanwhile mr reif was also focused on making universitywide impact his persistent question xe chow do make sure these tools are used by everyone in every discipline xe
the new college structure was his answer mr schwarzman said he would be interested in contributing and soon after mr reif made his pitch
xe cwell that is big number xe mr schwarzman said recalling his initial reaction
after further study he said yes
mr schwarzman said he hoped that the move might trigger others to invest in america xe future not just commercially he points to the major push the chinese government is making and notes the fruits of united states government funded research in the past xe technologies that helped america take the global lead in industries from the personal computer to the internet
xe ci think we xe ve been lagging for whatever reason xe mr schwarzman said
an earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the chief executive of the blackstone group he is stephen schwarzman not steven the error was repeated in picture caption

we should be thinking more about how much has changed our lives already and the future of human algorithm collaboration
by ed finn
dr finn is the director of the center for science and imagination at arizona state university
when it comes to the future of artificial intelligence we seem to be stuck in loop we tell the same stories about over and over again society is destroyed the xe cterminator xe movies the machines emulate and replace us xe cex machina xe the machines become gods pulling the strings xe cthe matrix xe this is dangerous way to think about because the stories we tell influence the decisions we make about how such systems should operate
none of the three scenarios just described represents future in which we would want to live they are all trajectories in which superintelligent machines simply leave us behind if we spend all of our time looking over our shoulders for killer robots that means we are not looking ahead to discern the outcomes we might actually want study of representations in film and television by christopher noessel underscores the problem we have lots of stories about the power and the duplicitous nature of but almost none exploring what he calls the xe cuntold xe themes accountability effective policy and broad literacy around these technologies
to thrive in the era of intelligent machines we need to expand our thinking instead of worrying about godlike super machines we should tell better stories about all the everyday ways is already changing the world
when you ask alexa to tell you joke or turn on light switch across the room it requires xe vast planetary network xe of algorithms and machines to make that bit of magic happen commercial airplanes are steered by automated piloting systems for nearly the entire flight and companies like waymo are deploying autonomous cars buses and trucks machine learning provides live translation on skype calls and similar techniques are filtering your email spam and curating your social media feeds
the real future is already here but the stories we watch in darkened theaters are nightmares about distant future that might never arrive
today xe everyday is often invisible hidden behind cloud based services that xe cjust work xe for consumers often the boundary between automation and intelligence is blurry does the neural network that distinguishes zip codes for the postal service or the thousand page algorithm that uses to route its delivery trucks count as artificial intelligence in practical terms every time we cede agency and decision making to machine we are endorsing the intelligence or the competence of an algorithm to do some thinking for us it turns out that machines don xe have to be superhuman or superintelligent to wield power over us
of course the risk that machines will be more intelligent or more competent than humans is real and already visible in arenas like chess and go but instead of treating that as zero sum competition we could adopt frame of collaboration
when garry kasparov was defeated by ibm xe deep blue in his response was to start exploring how humans and machines might play chess as teammates rather than opponents he helped start the xe cadvanced chess xe movement where humans and machines form collaborative teams sometimes called xe ccentaurs xe the best of these centaur teams outperform top chess playing machines as well as human grandmasters
the most successful systems out there today are dependent on teams of humans just as the humans depend on those systems to provide insights and perform tasks beyond their own abilities image processing can outperform human radiologists at spotting tumors in rays if medical personnel get patients in front of the right machine and ask the right questions but teams of human doctors will be vital to marrying technology and empathy for the effective treatment of complex diseases
as becomes more capable we will start to see signs of real collaboration which requires level of trust akin to that of human partners in complex environment our lives are full of cultural work that requires this kind of give and take which depends in turn on accessibility literacy and accountability most of the truly beautiful things humans create emerge from that kind of multi agent process as we start to work with we will need to find ways to collaborate with it
so how do we go about expanding our thinking
one way is to recognize the diversity of work already going on that gets drowned out by the loudest and most powerful voices talking about it is also important to consider who is in the room when systems are designed and how easy it is for those human architects to embed their biases in the systems they build additional voices need to be at the table people from groups underrepresented in silicon valley style innovation especially women people of color and the economically disadvantaged bringing more diversity into the design process will improve the outcomes of technologists who seek to design products and solve problems for xe ceveryone xe
one great example of bringing diversity into is the global narratives project from cambridge university xe leverhulme center for the future of intelligence which seeks to understand what stories we are telling about the future of outside the anglophone west
another kind of diversity lies in our rich cultural archives people have been dreaming and writing about for centuries inspired by the work of mr noessel the center for the future of intelligence and others am helping to lead policy futures project at arizona state university and the new america foundation our first goal is to create taxonomy of in science fiction literature and film we hope this will give us broader view of the possibilities of by resurrecting good ideas that we have collectively forgotten while also highlighting the gaps in our collective thinking
the best way forward is to commit to the goal of thinking more holistically about and then orchestrate activities and conversations to advance it when you bring together science fiction writers technologists and policymakers you create feedback loop in which interesting things tend to happen people ask one another simple yet surprisingly profound questions leaders in these different fields occasionally realize they have been working with impoverished conceptions of what particular words or ideas really mean new plans and stories get hatched from the science fiction advisory council at the prize foundation to the value that entities like nasa have attached to science fiction there is growing recognition in the power and potential of this feedback loop
is too interesting too ubiquitous and too poorly defined to be left to hollywood mega franchises or the same old cultural shorthand we xe ve been using for years the thinking machines we should be talking about are not super intelligences or replicants but rather the just smart enough technologies already changing our lives how will we deal with that is not alien or omniscient but just few steps ahead of us like good tennis partner
we have to tell new stories about xe clittle xe machines that aren xe trying to take over the world but just get the job done most important we need more stories about real people in these futures and how we will adapt to reality where we share intelligence work and creativity with our machines

san francisco xe for decades intel was one of the most predictable players in the technology industry on thursday the semiconductor maker blindsided silicon valley with the abrupt resignation of its chief executive over relationship with subordinate
the chip company said it was recently informed that brian krzanich had xe cpast consensual relationship xe with an intel employee an investigation by internal and external counsel then found that mr krzanich had violated non fraternization policy that applies to managers the company said so intel xe board accepted his resignation
the disclosure about mr krzanich soft spoken chip manufacturing specialist who joined intel in and has run it for five years left many questions unanswered the company declined to identify the employee involved when the relationship took place or any additional details it characterized its internal investigation as xe congoing xe
mr krzanich xe relationship with the subordinate was not recent said one person briefed on the situation who declined to be identified because the company discussions over the matter were confidential intel found out about the relationship only few days ago this person added
robert swan intel xe chief financial officer was appointed interim chief executive while the company conducts search for permanent new leader mr krzanich could not be reached for comment
xe cwe appreciate brian xe many contributions to intel xe andy bryant intel xe chairman said in prepared statement he added that he knew the company would continue to perform
mr krzanich xe resignation is the latest turmoil in executive suites since the metoo movement emerged in the wake of allegations against producer harvey weinstein the heightened scrutiny of workplace behavior has led executives at nike lululemon athletica social finance and many other companies to leave their jobs
over the years other chief executives have also been felled after violating workplace behavior standards either because of affairs or through other incidents including at boeing hewlett packard and priceline
intel which recently yielded the title of the world xe largest chip maker to samsung is approaching its th birthday the company known for microprocessor chips that carry out calculations in most personal computers and server systems has prided itself as standard setter in corporate governance
an intel spokesman said the company xe most recent version of its strict non fraternization policy which prohibits managers from sexual or romantic relationships with employees who report directly or indirectly to them has been in place since
even so intel like many companies has not been impervious to romance mr krzanich who rose through the ranks at intel married woman who once worked in the company xe manufacturing operations they have two daughters the wife of mr krzanich xe predecessor paul otellini who died last year also once worked at intel
as chief executive mr krzanich has been changing intel xe corporate culture the company has undergone an exodus of longtime managers xe such as renee james who was mr krzanich xe no but later faded in prominence and left the company xe and the arrival of senior executives from other companies such as qualcomm
mr krzanich argued that intel needed an infusion of fresh thinking to achieve his goal of reducing the company xe dependence on the sluggish market he also publicly committed the company to increasing the number of employees from groups underrepresented in some technical specialties including minorities and women
xe cintel is different place and we xe ve done this while growing the business xe mr krzanich said at the company xe annual shareholder meeting in may
but five former intel employees who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation said mr krzanich at times exhibited an arrogant personal style and handled staff changes in ways that created enemies some of these people said the metoo movement most likely influenced how intel xe board handled the matter
mr krzanich also raised eyebrows by selling about million in intel shares last november after the company learned of potential security flaws in its chips and before the issue was disclosed this year the company said the sale was unrelated to the flaws adding that mr krzanich continued to hold shares in line with intel guidelines
mr krzanich sought to broaden intel xe business taking the company into fields such as drones and wearable devices he also presided over major acquisitions such as intel xe billion acquisition of mobileye an israeli company that makes chips and software used in driver assistance systems and self driving cars
yet intel has lately struggled to sustain moore xe law the pace of chip miniaturization named for the company xe co founder gordon moore which expands the capabilities of its chips it has announced repeated delays in perfecting its latest production process
during mr krzanich xe tenure intel xe market capitalization rose to above billion with share price that is up percent since the beginning of on thursday while the company xe shares declined percent on the announcement of the leadership change intel said it expected to report second quarter results that exceed wall street estimates
pierre ferragu an analyst with new street research said the projection points to xe cmonster xe quarter for the company xe cthe resignation itself is in our view completely idiosyncratic event with no impact to the company xe he wrote in research note
mr swan is relative newcomer to intel joining the company as chief financial officer from general atlantic in his past experience includes stint at private equity firm general atlantic and nine years as chief financial officer at ebay
mr krzanich xe total compensation last year was million according to the executive compensation firm equilar that put him at th place in an annual ranking of highest paid chief executives in the united states that equilar conducted for the new york times
an earlier version of this article misstated intel xe position in the semiconductor market it is one of the largest makers of semiconductors not the largest

alex karp grew up in liberal household and considers himself progressive he voted for hillary clinton and he lives and works in silicon valley
yet mr karp the chief executive of palantir has found himself increasingly at odds with his peers in the technology industry as it publicly distances itself from the government particularly the department of defense under president trump
mr karp readily admits he would prefer that mr trump didn xe occupy the oval office but he believes that silicon valley xe already facing something of crisis of user confidence over issues including privacy and foreign influence xe is setting itself up for fall
xe cit xe going to be very significant problem for the valley xe mr karp who rarely speaks publicly said in an interview in his manhattan office
xe ci don xe know how you stand up and talk to marine or special operator and explain to them how you have piece of software that will allow them to come home xe or more likely allow them to come home xe and you xe re not going to allow them to use it xe he said xe ci think it xe nearly impossible argument to make outside the valley without people being legitimately pretty upset xe
employees at companies including google microsoft and amazon don xe see it the same way google under internal pressure abandoned its contract with the pentagon on project maven which used artificial intelligence software to improve the analysis of imagery from drones microsoft xe chief executive satya nadella has faced opposition from workers who want the company to end contract with immigration and customs enforcement and amazon employees have objected to providing facial recognition technology to police departments and other agencies
all of this has set off quiet xe but growing xe debate across corporate america in the age of trump what does it mean to be patriotic company when you vehemently disagree with your nation xe leader
within the technology industry the debate has been couched as xe cmoral and ethical xe one xe cwe believe that google should not be in the business of war xe employees wrote in petition that led to the company xe withdrawal from project maven
in truth the ethical arguments are diversion this is political
and there is real danger in letting politics undermine the storied relationship between the government and silicon valley xe hewlett packard built sonar radar and aviation equipment for the government during world war ii for example xe that has led to much of the innovation we enjoy today
adam grant professor at the wharton school and member of the defense innovation board an independent federal advisory committee set up under president barack obama said he believed that the partisanship that was contributing to the debate would ultimately stifle innovation
xe ci worry that it will stall progress xe he said xe cinnovation has been fueled for decades by private public partnerships it smacks of cutting off your nose to spite your face even if you xe re not fan of the president you can still serve your country xe
mr karp whose parents met at civil rights demonstration said he believed that american companies including those in silicon valley had moral obligation to support the country and its military no matter who was living at pennsylvania avenue
xe cwe xe re proud that we xe re working with the government xe he said
of course mr karp certainly has an interest in maintaining relationships between the government and the technology sector palantir which uses technology to analyze vast troves of data was founded with the help of million from the central intelligence agency xe venture capital arm and much of its business model was to use data to help the government in the wake of the sept attacks but that makes his willingness to be so forthright about his view of the president refreshing when his peers who may have similar views stay quiet
xe ci obviously am very biased xe he said xe ci have problem if go to cocktail party in silicon valley because they want to know xe is it true that your product is used to target terrorists xe yes and some people don xe agree with that that xe fine by the way don xe expect everyone to agree with that xe
his outspokenness is even more surprising given that co founder of palantir is peter thiel serial entrepreneur who has publicly supported mr trump
xe cwe didn xe vote for the same people xe mr karp said without hesitation xe cwe xe re not going to vote for the same people xe
still even if it is political allegiances that have prompted tech workers to push back the ethical issues around artificial intelligence are not insignificant everyone from elon musk to stephen hawking has raised questions about technological warfare in the future but we are still most likely decades away from those extreme kinds of worries being realized
in fairness the fears of some technology workers that their work will be used for ill do have historical basis xe in other countries ferdinand porsche designed tanks for the nazis and hugo boss made their uniforms was that patriotism would it matter
reid hoffman who founded linkedin and sold it to microsoft where he now sits on the board said there were real worries about how the government would use powerful technologies like artificial intelligence
xe ci think that the majority of silicon valley people have strong worry reflex against weapons xe said mr hoffman who is member of the defense innovation board with mr grant the trump administration he said has xe camplified xe concerns over xe cpossible bad government action xe
but mr karp said claims that president could steer us toward an authoritarian world powered by artificial intelligence were too extreme
xe camerica is complicated modern democracy with numerous checks and balances so that no one person has the ability to do insane things xe mr karp said with government work he added xe cyou xe re buying into the inherent fabric and structure of the country xe
lost in the conversation in silicon valley is its own history the internet itself was originally funded by an arm of the defense department that is now called the defense advanced research projects agency as recently as the obama administration silicon valley xe biggest technology giants embraced roles advising the government
but there is difference between today xe tech giants like google and facebook and those who turned the santa clara valley into silicon valley bond with the government xe cwas clearly not part of the founding of the consumer internet in any relevant way xe mr karp said
it is connection that should be better understood by the employees now pushing for it to be severed those bright minds are able to have this debate in part because of the work done by their predecessors
and given the very real questions that have emerged about the benefits xe or lack thereof xe that the biggest tech companies truly offer society those workers might want to rethink their position
as mr karp pointed out when we talked about the big technology companies xe cif actually the narrative was xe we are helping also with our defense xe then people would understand the value of these other things xe they do
there could come time when silicon valley wishes it was waving that flag

ust over century ago in ludwigshafen germany scientist named carl bosch assembled team of engineers to exploit new technique in chemistry year earlier another german chemist fritz haber hit upon process to pull nitrogen from the air and combine it with hydrogen to produce tiny amounts of ammonia nh xe but haber xe process was delicate requiring the maintenance of high temperatures and high pressure bosch wanted to figure out how to adapt haber xe discovery for commercial purposes xe as we would say today to xe cscale it up xe anyone looking at the state of manufacturing in europe around bosch observed could see that the task was daunting the technology simply didn xe exist
over the next decade however bosch and his team overcame multitude of technological and metallurgical challenges he chronicled them in his acceptance speech for the nobel prize for chemistry xe an honor he won because the haber bosch process as it came to be known changed the world his breakthrough made possible the production of ammonia on an industrial scale providing the world with cheap and abundant fertilizer the scientist and historian vaclav smil called haber bosch xe cthe most important technical invention of the th century xe bosch had effectively removed the historical bounds on crop yields so much so that he was widely credited with making xe cbread from air xe by some estimates bosch xe work made possible the lives of more than two billion human beings over the last years
what the haber bosch method had going for it from the very start was ready market fertilizer was already in high demand but it came primarily from limited natural reserves in far flung locales xe bird droppings scraped from remote islands near peru for instance or mineral stores of nitrogen dug out of the chilean desert because synthetic ammonia competed with existing products it was able to follow timeworn pattern of innovation in much the same way that leds have supplanted fluorescent and incandescent bulbs which in turn had displaced kerosene lamps and wax candles novel product or process often replaces something already in demand if it is better or cheaper xe and especially if it is better and cheaper xe it usually wins in the marketplace haber bosch did exactly that
it may now be that another gas xe carbon dioxide co xe xe can be removed from the air for commercial purposes and that its removal could have profound effect on the future of humanity but it xe almost certainly too soon to say for sure one sunny morning last october several engineers from swiss firm called climeworks ambled onto the roof of power generating waste incineration plant in hinwil village about minutes outside zurich the technicians had in front of them large devices stacked in two rows of six that resembled oversize front loading clothes dryers these were xe cdirect air capture xe machines which soon would begin collecting carbon dioxide from air drawn in through their central ducts once trapped the co xe would then be siphoned into large tanks and trucked to local coca cola bottler where it would become the fizz in soft drink
is it to tinker with the environment to fight climate change
the machines themselves require significant amount of energy they depend on electric fans to pull air into the ducts and over special material known as sorbent laced with granules that chemically bind with co xe periodic blasts of heat then release the captured gas from the sorbent with customized software managing the whole catch and release cycle climeworks had installed the machines on the roof of the power plant to tap into the plant xe low carbon electricity and the heat from its incineration system few dozen yards away from the new installation sat an older stack of climeworks machines in total that had been whirring on the same rooftop for more than year so far these machines had captured about metric tons or about short tons of carbon dioxide from the air and fed it by pipeline to an enormous greenhouse nearby where it was plumping up tomatoes eggplants and xc xa che during tour of the greenhouse paul ruser the manager suggested taste the results xe chere try one xe he said handing me crisp ripe cucumber he plucked from nearby vine it was the finest direct air capture cucumber xe ever had
climeworks xe rooftop plant represents something new in the world the first direct air capture venture in history seeking to sell co xe by the ton when the company xe founders christoph gebald and jan wurzbacher began openly discussing their plans to build business several years ago they faced deluge of skepticism xe ci would say nine out of people reacted critically xe gebald told me xe cthe first thing they said was xe this will never work technically xe and finally in we convinced them it works technically since we built the big plant in hinwil but once we convinced them that it works technically they would say xe well it will never work economically xe xe xe
for the moment skeptics of climeworks xe business plan are correct the company is not turning profit to build and install the units at hinwil hand assembled in second floor workshop in zurich cost between million and million which is the primary reason it costs the firm between and to remove metric ton of co xe from the air even as the company has attracted about million in private investments and grants it faces the same daunting task that confronted carl bosch century ago how much can it bring costs down and how fast can it scale up
gebald and wurzbacher believe the way to gain commercial foothold is to sell their expensive co xe to agriculture or beverage companies not only do these companies require co xe anyway some also seem willing to pay premium for vital ingredient they can use to help market their products as eco friendly
still greenhouses and soda bubbles together represent small global market xe perhaps six million metric tons of co xe annually and gebald and wurzbacher did not get into carbon capture to grow xc xa che or put bubbles in fanta they believe that over the next seven years they can bring expenses down to level that would enable them to sell co xe into more lucrative markets air captured co xe can be combined with hydrogen and then fashioned into any kind of fossil fuel substitute you want instead of making bread from air you can make fuels from air already climeworks and another company carbon engineering which is based in british columbia have moved aggressively on this idea the canadians have even lined up investors including bill gates to produce synthetic fuel at large industrial plants from air captured co xe
the ultimate goal for air capture however isn xe to turn it into product xe at least not in the traditional sense what gebald and wurzbacher really want to do is to pull vast amounts of co xe out of the atmosphere and bury it forever deep underground and sell that service as an offset climeworks xe captured co xe has already been injected deep into rock formations beneath iceland by the end of the year the firm intends to deploy units near reykjavik to expand the operation but at that point the company will be moving into uncharted economic territory xe purveyors of service that seems desperately needed to help slow climate change but does not at present replace anything on the consumer or industrial landscape to complicate matters ton of buried co xe is not something that human beings or governments have shown much demand for and so companies like climeworks face quandary how do you sell something that never existed before something that may never be cheap into market that is not yet real
even the most enthusiastic believers in direct air capture stop short of describing it as miracle technology it xe more frequently described as an old idea xe xe cscrubbers xe that remove co xe have been used in submarines since at least the xe that is being radically upgraded for variety of new applications it xe arguably the case in fact that when it comes to reducing our carbon emissions direct air capture will be seen as an option that xe too expensive and too modest in impact xe cthe only way that direct air capture becomes meaningful is if we do all the other things we need to do promptly xe hal harvey california energy analyst who studies climate friendly technologies and policies told me recently harvey and others make the case that the biggest fastest and cheapest gains in addressing atmospheric carbon will come from switching our power grid to renewable energy or low carbon electricity from transitioning to electric vehicles and imposing stricter mileage regulations on gas powered cars and trucks and from requiring more energy efficient buildings and appliances in short the best way to start making progress toward decarbonized world is not to rev up millions of air capture machines right now it xe to stop putting co xe in the atmosphere in the first place
the future of carbon mitigation however is on countdown timer as atmospheric co xe concentrations have continued to rise if the nations of the world were to continue on the current track it would be impossible to meet the objectives of the paris agreement which set goal limiting warming to degrees celsius or ideally degrees and it would usher in world of misery and economic hardship already temperatures in some regions have climbed more than degree celsius as report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change noted last october these temperature increases have led to an increase in droughts heat waves floods and biodiversity losses and make the chaos of or degrees xe additional warming seem inconceivable further problem is that maintaining today xe emissions path for too long runs the risk of doing irreparable damage to the earth xe ecosystems xe causing harm that no amount of technological innovation can make right xe cthere is no reverse gear for natural systems xe harvey says xe cif they go they go if we defrost the tundra it xe game over xe the same might be said for the greenland and west antarctic ice sheets or our coral reefs such resources have an asymmetry in their natural architectures they can take thousands or millions of years to form but could reach conditions of catastrophic decline in just few decades
at the moment global co xe emissions are about billion metric tons per year and we xe re on track to raise temperatures by degrees celsius by to have shot at maintaining climate suitable for humans the world xe nations most likely have to reduce co xe emissions drastically from the current level xe to perhaps billion or billion metric tons per year by then through some kind of unprecedented political and industrial effort we need to bring carbon emissions to zero by around in this context climeworks xe effort to collect metric tons of co xe on rooftop near zurich might seem like bailing out the ocean one bucket at time conceptually however it xe important last year xe report noted that it may be impossible to limit warming to degrees by through only rapid switch to clean energy electric cars and the like to preserve livable environment we may also need to extract co xe from the atmosphere as wurzbacher put it xe cif you take all these numbers from the you end up with something like eight to billion tons xe gigatons xe of co xe that need to be removed from the air every year if we are serious about or degrees xe
there happens to be name for things that can do this kind of extraction work negative emissions technologies or nets some nets like trees and plants predate us and probably don xe deserve the label through photosynthesis our forests take extraordinary amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and if we were to magnify efforts to reforest clear cut areas xe or plant new groves process known as afforestation xe we could absorb billions more metric tons of carbon in future years what xe more we could grow crops specifically to absorb co xe and then burn them for power generation with the intention of capturing the power plant emissions and pumping them underground process known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs other negative emissions technologies include manipulating farmland soil or coastal wetlands so they will trap more atmospheric carbon and grinding up mineral formations so they will absorb co xe more readily process known as xe cenhanced weathering xe
negative emissions can be thought of as form of time travel ever since the industrial revolution human societies have produced an excess of co xe by taking carbon stores from deep inside the earth xe in the form of coal oil and gas xe and from stores aboveground mostly wood then putting it into the atmosphere by burning it it has become imperative to reverse the process xe that is take co xe out of the air and either restore it deep inside the earth or contain it within new surface ecosystems this is certainly easier to prescribe than achieve xe call of negative emission is hard xe even afforestation or reforestation xe sally benson professor of energy resources engineering at stanford explains xe cit xe not about saying xe want to plant tree xe it xe about saying xe we want to plant billion trees xe xe xe nevertheless such practices offer glimmer of hope for meeting future emissions targets xe cwe have to come to grips with the fact that we waited too long and that we took some options off the table xe michael oppenheimer princeton scientist who studies climate and policy told me as result nets no longer seem to be just interesting ideas they look like necessities and as it happens the climeworks machines on the rooftop do the work each year of about trees
last fall the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine published lengthy study on carbon removal stephen pacala princeton professor who led the authors pointed out to me that negative emissions technologies have various strengths and drawbacks and that xe cportfolio xe approach xe pursue them all then see which are the best xe may be the shrewdest bet if costs for direct air capture can be reduced pacala says he sees great promise especially if the machines can offset emissions from economic sectors that for technological reasons will transition to zero carbon much more slowly than others commercial aviation for instance won xe be converted to running on solar power anytime soon jennifer wilcox chemical engineering professor at worcester polytechnic institute in massachusetts told me that air capture could likewise help counter the impact of several vital industries xe cthere are process emissions that come from producing iron and steel cement and glass xe she says xe cand any time you make these materials there xe chemical reaction that emits co xe xe direct air capture could even lessen the impacts of the haber bosch processes for making fertilizer by some estimates that industry now accounts for percent of all co xe emissions
pacala equates the challenges confronting climeworks and carbon engineering to what the wind and solar power industries faced in the and xe when their products were expensive compared with fossil fuels those industries couldn xe rely on demand from the private sector alone but some policymakers perceived tremendous environmental and public benefits if they could surmount that hurdle government investments in research along with state and federal tax credits helped the young industries expand xe cwind and solar are now the cheapest forms of energy in the right locations xe pacala says xe cthe return on those investments if you calculated it would blow the doors off anything in your portfolio it xe like investing in early apple so it xe spectacular story of success and direct air capture is precisely the same kind of problem in which the only barrier is that it xe too costly xe
thirty years ago we had chance to save the planet read about the decade we almost stopped climate change
most of climeworks xe employees work in big industrial space in downtown zurich on two floors of low slung building that the company sublets from german aerospace firm manufacturing operations are on the ground floor the research labs are upstairs along with small suite of shared offices hallway kitchen and hangout area the place has the stark casual feel of tech start up with one exception the walls are lined with oversize photos of pivotal moments in climeworks xe young history xe its ungainly early prototypes the opening of the first hinwil plant that collected co xe for the greenhouse
xe cit xe little bit by accident that we are based in switzerland xe wurzbacher told me he and gebald both grew up in germany and met as undergraduates at zurich the swiss federal institute of technology xe cwe met on day on the th of october of xe gebald recalled xe cand on day we decided that we xe have company xe their aspiration was to be entrepreneurs not to start carbon capture firm but both men were drawn to research on renewable energy and reducing emissions after they completed their master xe projects they decided to create direct air capture prototype and go into business both took the title of company director helped by number of small grants climeworks was incorporated in
the two men were not alone in trying to chip away at decades of carbon emissions an american start up global thermostat now finishing its first commercial plant in alabama began working on air capture machines in and almost from the start gebald and wurzbacher found themselves in friendly competition with david keith the harvard engineering professor who had just started carbon engineering in british columbia keith xe company settled on different air capture technology xe employing higher heat process and liquid solution to capture co xe xe to brew synthetic fuels climeworks xe big advantage is that it can make smaller plants early keith told me xe ci am crazy jealous it xe because they xe re using modular design and we xe re not xe on the other hand keith said he believes his firm is closer to building big plant that could capture carbon at more reasonable cost and produce substantial amounts of fuel xe ci don xe see path for them to match this xe gebald told me he thinks his and keith xe companies will each succeed with differing approaches for now what all the founders have in common is belief that the cost of capturing ton of carbon will soon drop sharply
their view is not always shared by outside observers xe howard herzog for instance an engineer who has spent years looking at the potential for these machines told me that he thinks the costs will remain between and per metric ton some of herzog xe reasons for skepticism are highly technical and relate to the physics of separating gases some are more easily grasped he points out that because direct air capture machines have to move tremendous amounts of air through filter or solution to glean ton of co xe xe the gas for all its global impact makes up only about percent of our atmosphere xe the process necessitates large expenditures for energy and big equipment what he has likewise observed in analyzing similar industries that separate gases suggests that translating spreadsheet projections for capturing co xe into real world applications will reveal hidden costs xe ci think there has been lot of hype about this and it xe not going to revolutionize anything xe he told me adding that he thinks other negative emissions technologies will prove cheaper xe cat best it xe going to be bit player xe
last year when david keith and his associates at carbon engineering published figures projecting that their carbon capture technology could bring costs as low as metric ton herzog was not convinced keith nevertheless made the case to me that two new investors in carbon engineering xe chevron technology ventures and subsidiary of occidental petroleum xe scrutinized his company xe numbers to an exhaustive degree and agreed the economics of the venture were solid enough to merit putting up substantial amounts in million investment round both climeworks founders told me they agreed with keith xe cost estimates and saw similar downward curve for their own technology
climeworks xe current goal is to remove percent of the world xe annual co xe emissions by the mid yet meeting such benchmark if it xe even possible would require bringing the cost of direct air capture down by nearly an order of magnitude while maintaining and expanding their roster of clients substantially at the moment wurzbacher and gebald have planned for several generations of climeworks machines with each new model promising declining prices xe cbasically we have road map xe down to down to and ton xe wurzbacher said xe cthis is over the next five years down to we know quite well what we xe re doing xe and beyond wurzbacher suggested things get murkier to move below that price would depend on xe cnew developments xe in technology or manufacturing
both founders told me they expect to reap enormous cost reductions from expanding production xe activities that involve buying materials more cheaply in bulk and assembling units on automated factory lines instead of building them by hand as is the case now design advances could wring out other costs xe cmaintenance is very expensive xe wurzbacher said xe cright now if we exchange the filters in the collectors we have to rent crane and that xe lot of man hours in the next generation units we have improved that lot so relatively small design changes could cut the costs of maintenance by factor of three xe climeworks also intends to derive savings from improvements to crucial materials like the sorbent that catches the co xe at the moment the company xe technology requires that the temperature inside the units be raised periodically to about degrees celsius to release co xe from the sorbent so it can be drawn off and stored if the process can be done at lower temperature the units will use less energy and the life of the materials should be extended further driving down costs
the company xe ambitions for mass production may still seem extreme to actually capture percent of the world xe carbon emissions by would by gebald xe calculations require that climeworks build carbon capture plants like the ones on the roof at hinwil that adds up to about million carbon collectors for company that has only built collectors and has small plants around europe it xe staggering number the climeworks founders therefore try to think of their product as the automotive industry might xe piece of mass produced technology and metal not the carbon they hope to sequester xe cwhat we xe re doing is gas separation xe wurzbacher said xe cand that xe traditionally process industry business like oil and gas but we don xe really see ourselves there xe
the founders note that toyota makes more than million cars annually xe cevery co xe collector has about the same weight and dimensions of car xe roughly two tons and roughly meters by meters by meters xe gebald said xe cand all the methods used to produce the co xe collectors could be well automated so we have the automotive industry as model for how to produce things in large quantities for low cost xe the two men have already sought advice from audi they are also aware that the automotive industry perfected its methods over the course of years climeworks if it plans to have even modest impact doesn xe have nearly as much time
in the economist paul samuelson put forward theory that made distinction between xe cprivate consumption goods xe xe bread cars houses and the like xe and commodities that existed apart from the usual laws of supply and demand modern global markets are obviously quite successful at pricing private goods we need and want but the other type of commodity samuelson was describing is something now known as xe cpublic good xe which benefits everyone but is not bought sold or consumed the same way definitions of public good can vary but the oft used examples are lighthouses national defenses and clean air
direct air capture can no doubt create private goods like soft drink carbonation or fuels what makes its value so difficult to estimate is that in burying co xe for better atmosphere xe and almost certainly better future xe its purveyors would also create public good xe cthe challenge with just collecting and burying co xe is that there isn xe market yet xe julio friedmann former united states energy department official who now works at columbia university told me xe cwhat it xe really about is offering an environmental service for fee xe and what that means in short is that direct air capture xe success would be limited to the size of the market for private goods xe soda fizz greenhouse gas xe unless governments decided to intervene and help fund the equivalent of several million or more lighthouses
an intervention could take variety of forms it could be large grants for research to find better sorbent materials for instance which would be similar to government investments that long ago helped nurture the solar and wind power industries but help could also come by expanding regulations that already exist new and obscure united states tax provision known as and signed last year by president trump offers tax credit of up to ton for companies that bury co xe in geologic formations the credit can benefit oil and gas firms that pump co xe underground during drilling work as well as power plants that capture emissions directly from their smokestacks yet it could be used by climeworks too should it open plants in the united states xe but only if it manages to remove and bury tons of co xe per year
governments can make carbon more expensive too the climeworks founders told me they don xe believe their company will succeed on what they call xe cclimate impact xe scales unless the world puts significant prices on emissions in the form of carbon tax or carbon fee xe cour goal is to make it possible to capture co xe from the air for below per ton xe wurzbacher says xe cno one owns crystal ball but we think xe and we xe re quite confident xe that by something like we xe ll have global average price on carbon in the range of to ton xe there is optimism in this thinking he admitted at the moment only few european countries have made progress in assessing high price on carbon and in the united states carbon taxes have been repudiated recently at the polls most recently in washington state still if such prices became reality they could benefit the carbon extraction market in variety of ways company that sells product or uses process that creates high emissions xe an airline for instance or steel maker xe could be required to pay carbon removal companies per metric ton or more to offset their co xe output or government might use carbon tax proceeds to directly pay businesses to collect and bury co xe in the absence of any meaningful government action perhaps crusading billionaire could put all the money in his estate toward capturing co xe and stashing it in the earth
if carbon came to be properly priced global ledger would need to be kept by regulators so that air capture machines could suck in and bury an amount equivalent to the co xe that emitters produce because co xe emissions mix quickly into the atmosphere location would be mostly irrelevant except for the need to situate plants near clean energy sources and suitable areas for sequestering the gas underground direct air capture plant in iceland in other words could take in the same quantity of emissions produced by boeing in australia and thus negate its environmental impact what xe more there might not be limitations on the burial process xe cit doesn xe cost too much to pump co xe underground xe stanford xe sally benson says companies already sequester about million metric tons of co xe in the ground every year at number of sites around the world usually to enhance the oil drilling process xe cthe costs range from to per ton so the bigger cost in all of this is the cost of carbon capture xe benson told me that various studies suggest that the earth xe capacity for co xe sequestration could be in the range of trillion metric tons burying say five billion metric tons of co xe year is therefore within the realm of possibility
in an imaginary zero carbon future the revenue prospects for air capture companies would probably be enormous xe cif we get to to ton xe wurzbacher told me xe cthen the market is almost infinite xe it would be so large he said that even if his company went through an exponential expansion he doubted it could serve all the potential clients at such low prices companies could potentially fold carbon offsets into their pricing xe or be compelled to do so xe leading to an explosion in the market xe cchristoph and me we are always saying we think that if this develops in direction we think it does we are not founding company xe we xe re really founding new industry xe wurzbacher said he points to the work in iceland xe collaborative effort funded partly by the european union xe as the first step toward that industry at the moment single climeworks collector on reykjavik geothermal field takes in air and collects co xe after the gas is flushed from the machine xe filter it is mixed with water essentially forming hot seltzer then the liquid is injected into basalt rock formation deep underground over the course of about two years the co xe mineralizes locking away the gas forever
at climeworks xe offices in zurich asked valentin gutknecht who was at the time the company xe business development manager if he could bury in iceland my emissions from my plane flight from the united states to zurich he had written agreement he could print out and give me but it wouldn xe be cheap he warned the price was running about metric ton meaning my flight would cost about an extra but was hardly the first person to ask him the weekend before gutknecht told me he received unsolicited inquiries by email many were from potential customers who wanted to know how soon climeworks could bury their co xe emissions or how much machine might cost them had the sense was getting glimpse of what xe to come community of people xe not large enough to make difference but nonetheless motivated xe seemed ready to pay premium to reverse their co xe emissions
later wurzbacher told me he wants to offer xe cone click xe consumer service perhaps in year or two which would expand what they xe re doing in iceland to individual customers and businesses climeworks app could be installed on my smartphone he explained it could then be activated by my handset xe location services xe cyou fly over here to europe xe he explained xe cand the app tells you that you have just burned tons of co xe do you want to remove that well climeworks can remove it for you click here we xe ll charge your credit card and then you xe ll get stone made from co xe for every ton you sequester xe he sat back and sighed xe cthat would be my dream xe he said
paradoxical though it may seem it xe probable that synthetic fuels offer more practical path to creating viable business for direct air capture the vast and constant market demand for fuel is why carbon engineering has staked its future on synthetics the world currently burns about million barrels of oil day david keith told me he thinks that by the demand for transportation fuels will almost certainly be modified by the transition to electric vehicles xe cso let xe say you xe have to supply something like million barrels day in of fuels xe he said xe cthat xe still monster market xe
steve oldham carbon engineering xe chief executive added that direct air capture synthetics have an advantage over traditional fossil fuels they won xe have to spend dime on exploration xe cif you were brand new company looking to make fuel the cost of finding and then extracting fossil fuel is going to be really substantial xe he says xe cwhereas our plants you can build it right in the middle of california wherever you have air and water xe he told me that the company xe first large scale facility should be up and running by and will turn out at least barrels day of fuel feedstock xe the raw material sent to refineries
climeworks perceives large market for fuels too in town near zurich called rapperswil jona the firm has installed collector in small plant run by the local technical university to produce methane in room about the size of shipping container the climeworks machine takes in co xe through an air duct and sends it through maze of pipes to combine it with hydrogen which is derived from water using solar power when visited the plant was few weeks away from being operational but the methane coming out of the works could replace gasoline in the engine of just about any car bus or truck outfitted to run on natural gas at larger plant in italy climeworks recently joined consortium of european countries to produce synthetic methane that will be used by local trucking fleet with different tweaks and refinements the process could be adapted for diesel gasoline jet fuel xe or it could be piped directly to local neighborhoods as fuel for home furnaces
from an economic standpoint synthetic fuels could allow producers to plug into huge existing infrastructure xe refineries gas stations cars planes trucks homes ships xe and replace product already in demand with something arguably better but the new fuels are not necessarily cheaper carbon engineering aspires to deliver its product at an ultimate retail price of about per liter or per gallon what would make the product competitive are regulations in california that now require fuel sellers to produce fuels of lower xe ccarbon intensity xe to date this has meant blending gas and diesel with biofuels like ethanol but it could soon mean carbon capture synthetics too
in an expanding market synthetic fuels could have curious effects since they xe re made from airborne co xe and hydrogen and could be manufactured just about anywhere they could rearrange the geopolitical order xe tempering the power of handful of countries that now control natural gas and oil markets the methane project in rapperswil jona is especially suited for that country xe needs markus friedl thermodynamics professor overseeing the project told me because switzerland imports almost all of its natural gas and its ability to generate energy from renewable sources is limited during the colder months carbon capture derived fuels if they become cheap enough could be form of energy storage xe made in summer with solar or wind power and used in winter xe that carries lower cost and longer life than batteries
from an environmental standpoint air capture fuels are not utopian solution such fuels are carbon neutral not carbon negative they can xe take co xe from our industrial past and put it back into the earth if all the cars trucks and planes of the year run on renewable fuels instead of fossil fuels their co xe emissions would need to be removed from the air recycled into the same product they originally burned through and the cycle would need to repeat ad infinitum lest emissions increase even so these fuels could present an enormous improvement transportation xe currently the most significant source of emissions by sector in the united states xe could cease to be net emitter of co xe just as crucial the technology of direct air capture could scale up to become better and cheaper
huge expansion would also involve huge complications xe cyou start to get into really big challenges when you get to these big large scales xe glen peters research director at the cicero center for international climate research in oslo told me xe cif you can do one carbon capture facility where carbon engineering or climeworks can build big plant great you need to do that times and to capture million tons of co xe with direct air capture you need small power plant just to run that facility so if you xe re going to build one direct air capture facility every day for the next years to get to some of these scenarios then in addition we have to build new mini power plant every day as well xe it xe also the case that you have to address two extraordinary problems at the same time peters added xe cto reach degrees we need to halve emissions every decade xe he said that would mean persuading entire nations like china and the united states to switch from burning coal to using renewables at precisely the same time that we make immense investments in negative emission technologies and peters pointed out that this would need to be done even as governments choose among competing priorities health care education and so on
xe cthe idea of bringing direct air capture up to billion tons by the middle or later part of the century is such herculean task it would require an industrial scale up the likes of which the world has never seen xe princeton xe stephen pacala told me and yet pacala wasn xe pessimistic about making start he seemed to think it was necessary for the federal government to begin with significant research and investments in the technology xe to see how far and fast it could move forward so that it xe ready as soon as possible at climeworks gebald and wurzbacher spoke in similar terms asserting that the conversations around climate challenges are moving beyond the choice between clean energy or carbon removal both will be necessary
gebald and wurzbacher seem less assured about the future of global policy than on the mechanics of scaling up some of that they made clear was related to their outlook as engineers to what they xe ve gathered from observing companies like audi and apple if the last century has proved anything it xe that society is not always intent on acting quickly at least in the political realm to clean up our environment but we xe ve proved very good at building technology in mass quantities and making products and devices better and cheaper xe especially when there xe money to be made for now gebald and wurzbacher seemed to regard the climate challenge in mathematical terms how many gigatons needed to be removed how much would it cost per ton how many climeworks machines were required even if the figures were enormous even if they appeared impossible to see the future their way was to redefine the problem to move away from the narrative of loss to forget the multiplying stories of dying reefs and threatened coastlines xe and to begin to imagine other possibilities

an existential threat for the st century
by david brooks
opinion columnist
xe ve always thought americans would come together when we realized that we faced dangerous foreign foe and lo and behold now we have one china it xe become increasingly clear that china is grave economic technological and intellectual threat to the united states and the world order
and sure enough beneath the tv bluster of daily politics americans are beginning to join together mike pence and elizabeth warren can sound shockingly similar when talking about china xe economic policy nancy pelosi and republicans sound shockingly similar when they talk about chinese human rights abuses conservative and liberal policy thinkers can sound shockingly similar when they start talking about how to respond to the challenge from china
for the past few decades china has appeared to be net positive force in world affairs sure beijing violated trade agreements and escalated regional tensions but the chinese economic explosion lowered our cost of living and expanded prosperity worldwide
but few things have now changed first instead of liberalizing the chinese regime has become more aggressive and repressive
second the chinese have changed their economic focus so that their economy can directly replace ours the regime xe xe cmade in china xe policy is an attempt to go up the value chain and dominate high tech industries like aerospace robotics and biotech
according to report just released by marco rubio the chairman of the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship china xe artificial intelligence industry has grown by percent over the past year and has produced more patents than its counterparts one estimate suggests china is investing as much as times more capital in quantum computing than the my colleague thomas friedman notes that china already has the no and no drone manufacturers in the world and it is way ahead of us on technologies like facial and speech recognition
all this would be fine if china were simply competing but it xe not it xe stealing commission led by retired adm dennis blair and former ambassador to china jon huntsman estimated in that the annual loss to the economy from chinese intellectual property theft was between billion and billion
some of the theft is done through hacking some of it is done by surreptitiously buying tech firms through shell companies in order to seize the technologies some of it is pure espionage and thuggery sometimes china offers to give american companies access to its markets in exchange for the technology and then after china has digested the knowledge it closes off access this is not competition this is replacement
third beijing is trying to seize the controlling centers of the new tech economy if china can set the standard for communication and dominate artificial intelligence and quantum computing then it will be able to write the rules and penetrate the fibers of our society and our lives in ways that we cannot match
fourth the chinese challenge is no longer just economic it xe moral and intellectual it xe clash of two value systems and many people around the globe now believe that beijing xe values are better
we used to think china would democratize wrong we used to think the regime would liberalize wrong we used to think the chinese people would rise up and join the free democratic world wrong
fascinating essay by wenfang tang in american affairs makes for humbling reading for anybody who thinks we can take the superiority of our system for granted chinese people have more trust in their governing institutions than americans do in study percent of chinese said their government responds to their needs compared with percent of japanese and percent of south koreans chinese society has much more trust and social capital than american society china tang notes has the second highest level of social trust in the world after the netherlands
if we don xe learn to make the case for our system if we don xe make our system better lot of people everywhere will say xe ll take what they xe re having
the big debate is how do we respond the rubio report xe xe cmade in china and the future of american industry xe xe makes for compelling and fascinating reading xe cthis report xe central conclusion is that the cannot escape or avoid decisions about industrial policy xe
free market republicans used to fight against industrial policy xe heavy government intervention to support key sectors xe until their dying breaths but the chinese threat is already fundamentally changing thinking across the board the rubio report seeks to move beyond the free market statist dichotomy and find new ways to proceed
the biggest change may be to the american identity as reihan salam asks in the atlantic if china is the xe cother xe against which we define ourselves then who are xe cwe xe if china is an existential threat to the liberal international order do we have the capacity to improve our system so it can face the challenge xe to invest in human capital to reform our institutions repair the social fabric and make our political system function once again

the chip industry xe new paradigm looks like the old one
as cutting edge semiconductors got harder to make and demand boomed from new fields like bitcoin mining the world xe top processor manufacturers seemed invulnerable but shrinking sales forecasts from nvidia and applied materials show that companies are as prone as ever to economic cycles and excess inventory
the past decade has been happy one for the traditionally boom and bust industry it has become harder and more expensive to produce evermore sophisticated chips to cope with rising costs the industry consolidated which restrained over expansionist tendencies at the same time chip demand continued to rise profits boomed and the philadelphia semiconductor index rose sixfold over the past decade
one of the hottest areas has been graphics processors in addition to making games more realistic these chips are useful for machine learning self driving cars and mining cryptocurrencies nvidia company that has specialized in graphics chips saw its stock rise fold over the past decade raising its market capitalization to billion last month
the euphoria blinded investors to the fact that other causes of past booms have not been overturned demand is cyclical and booming economy has inflated chip sales in sectors where demand outruns supply customers order more than they need in hopes of receiving adequate supply and chip makers invest heavily to meet expected future sales
nvidia xe warning that next quarter xe revenue will be about percent less than analysts had expected is classic case the company blamed burst cryptocurrency bubble saying it would take another quarter or two to work through excess chip supply the company xe chief executive jen hsun huang said that he was as xe csurprised by it as anyone else xe and noted that rivals faced similar problems perhaps but demand for gaming and data center chips also is coming off the boil inventories and accounts receivable have risen sharply and now total third more than estimated sales for next quarter
inventory problems are hard for chip firms high fixed costs mean that profits rise sharply alongside volumes while margins fall through the floor as inventories are worked off advanced chips shed value as they sit around losing their technological edge firms usually cut capital expenditure to deal with bloat warning by applied materials xe the biggest maker of equipment for chip makers xe of slower future sales suggests that this is happening across the industry
this chip cycle is starting to resemble past ones

mr edsall contributes weekly column from washington on politics demographics and inequality
we may never stop arguing about which historic currents swept president trump into the white house
klaus schwab chairman of the world economic forum is unlikely to have had trump in mind when he described the fourth industrial revolution in davos in january
we stand on the brink of technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live work and relate to one another in its scale scope and complexity the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before
compared with previous industrial revolutions schwab continued
the fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than linear pace moreover it is disrupting almost every industry in every country and the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production management and governance
first schwab looked at the bright side
the possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices with unprecedented processing power storage capacity and access to knowledge are unlimited and these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence robotics the internet of things autonomous vehicles printing nanotechnology biotechnology materials science energy storage and quantum computing
schwab then turned his attention to the downside many xe cworkers are disillusioned and fearful that their own real incomes and those of their children will continue to stagnate xe he said and the xe cmiddle classes around the world are increasingly experiencing pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and unfairness xe
we tend to think of immigration xe now fracturing parties of the left and right both here and in europe xe as distinct from technological innovation but the two issues are intertwined on many levels even down to the fact that most unauthorized immigrants are people who fly here and overstay their visas not those who cross rural borders on foot and air travel is the least of it
in an august times story xe st century migrant xe essentials food shelter smartphone xe matthew brunwasser described the situation that obtains now
in this modern migration smartphone maps global positioning apps social media and whatsapp have become essential tools migrants depend on them to post real time updates about routes arrests border guard movements and transport as well as places to stay and prices all the while keeping in touch with family and friends
long before this douglas massey sociologist at princeton described the link between immigration and technology in paper xe cpatterns and processes of international migration in the st century xe
the same processes of economic globalization that create mobile populations in developing regions and which generate demand for their services in global cities also create links of transportation communication as well as politics and culture to make the international movement of people cheaper quicker and easier
there are innumerable social and economic pluses and minuses in politics however the emphasis has often been on the negative
xe cthe it revolution improved living standards and its great technical achievements enjoy high level of consumer and political support xe mordecai kurz an economist at stanford wrote in june paper xe chowever these sources of social benefits are also the cause of social losses and rising inequality that threaten the foundation of democratic society xe
schwab year earlier had put it this way there is an xe cinexorable shift from simple digitization the third industrial revolution to innovation based on combinations of technologies the fourth industrial revolution xe
with remarkable understatement schwab laid out the possible adverse consequences
as automation substitutes for labor across the entire economy the net displacement of workers by machines might exacerbate the gap between returns to capital and returns to labor
just to give sense of the exponential nature of the rate of technological change here xe how sergey brin described it in this year xe xe founders xe letter xe which was released earlier this week
the pentium iis we used in the first year of google performed about million floating point operations per second the gpus we use today perform about trillion such operations xe factor of about difference xe and our very own tpus are now capable of trillion floating point operations per second
in point of fact the use of robots xe and of other methods of replacing workers with machines xe has been growing in every advanced economy particularly in europe
according to the international federation of robotics xe cby regions the average robot density per employees in europe is units in the americas and in asia units xe
in march paper xe we were the robots automation in manufacturing and voting behavior in western europe xe massimo anelli italo colantone and piero stanig of bocconi university in milan found that xe crobot shock increases support for nationalist and radical right parties xe
the authors note that xe cboth technology and trade seem to drive structural changes which are consequential for voting behavior xe
xe cjob losses in manufacturing due to automation do create fertile territory for continued populist appeal xe daron acemoglu an economist at said by email
in fact some of the places where trump made the biggest gains relative to mccain or romney are in the heartland of heavy manufacturing where robots did lead to losses of manufacturing jobs
hostile voter reaction to automation according to three scholars at the oxford martin school at oxford university xe carl benedikt frey thor berger and chinchih chen xe was crucial to trump xe victory
in their october paper xe political machinery did robots swing the presidential election xe the authors demonstrate that
support for donald trump was significantly higher in local labor markets more exposed to the adoption of robots other things equal counterfactual analysis shows that michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania would have swung in favor of the hillary clinton if robot adoption had been two percent lower over the investigated period leaving the democrats with majority in the electoral college
along similar lines frank levy also an economist at wrote in december paper
ai artificial intelligence is helping to slowly polarize the occupational structure as it both creates high wage work and displaces men and women from certain blue collar and clerical xe mid skilled xe jobs into lower wage work the result is similar to the displacement caused by manufactured imports and off shored services
in his paper xe computers and populism artificial intelligence jobs and politics in the near term xe levy writes
on balance near term ai will have the greatest effect on blue collar work clerical work and other mid skilled occupations given globalization xe effect on the presidential election it is worth noting that near term ai and globalization replace many of the same jobs
take the case of truck drivers driverless trucks are already in use abroad in ports and mines and according to levy xe cthere should be sizable number of fully automated port facilities mines and other industrial facilities xe by with these developments he estimated there will be fewer truck driving jobs in than the bureau of labor statistics currently projects
surveying the trucking industry recently in xe the future of work robots ai and automation xe darrell west scholar at brookings warns that full adoption of driverless vehicles xe cwould put at least million drivers out of work xe
assessing the full range of employment west observes that
robots autonomous vehicles virtual reality artificial intelligence machine learning drones and the internet of things are moving ahead rapidly and transforming the way businesses operate and how people earn their livelihoods for millions who work in occupations like food service retail sales and truck driving machines are replacing their jobs
levy argues that if the use of industrial robots on assembly and production lines continues to grow at the current pace
the stock of robots in the would be higher in than in if conservatively assume that each robot replaces two assemblers and fabricators the additional robots would result in fewer assembler and fabricator jobs in than otherwise would have been the case
where do these displaced workers look for way to make living levy xe answer is farther down the ladder
ai xe near term effect will not be mass unemployment but occupational polarization resulting in slowly growing number of persons moving from mid skilled jobs into lower wage work
into such fields as food preparation and serving building and grounds cleaning and maintenance and personal care and services
for many men moving from the manufacturing or comparable job he took pride in to job in fast food operation or in caring for the elderly is tough to swallow not to mention the dislocating effects of the technological innovations in contraception that helped usher in the women xe and reproductive rights movements
levy points out that the cuts resulting from and automation in middle skill employment will be relatively modest in the short term but the cuts will resonate far beyond their limited numbers
job losses will appear as accelerating trends over time trucks driving in dedicated lanes will appear on the roads and in multiple news stories increased numbers of people will be working side by side with robots when media story describes an ai induced layoff in occupation other persons in that occupation will assume they are also at risk these developments will occur against backdrop of monopoly like firms like alphabet google amazon apple microsoft and facebook
what is the political significance of the driven changes in the work force they are the grist for the populist mill
levy writes
populist politician who campaigned on ai induced job loss would start with ready made definitions of the people xe and the xe celite xe based on national fault lines that were sharpened in the presidential election this politician also would have ready made example of disrespect the set of highly educated coastal xe celites xe who make very good living developing robots to put xe cthe people xe out of work
while levy looks at the issue from the vantage point of those harmed by robotics and information technology kurz the stanford economist examines the economic winners in recent essay for project syndicate he writes
it driven automation proceeded at the same time that corporate market power was rising because technological improvements are the crucial engine of rising productivity and growth it advances are universally viewed as economically beneficial
the favorable view according to kurz masks the
dark side by enabling and supporting the rise of corporate monopoly power it innovations have caused the rise in inequality and contributed to the slowdown in wage growth
while operating legally xe indeed with the full support of the legal system xe contemporary corporate technology leaders including brin jeff bezos steve jobs who died in and mark zuckerberg accumulated unprecedented amounts of wealth according to kurz
once an it monopoly is established it endows the company with the advantage of first mover combination of associated factors xe additional patents intellectual property rights trade secrets falling computing and storage costs and decreasing network user costs xe then enable the company to consolidate market power raise barriers to competition and make it virtually impossible for potential competitors to break its power it networks endow market leader with economies of scale that allow it to grow rapidly using their market power such firms choke off innovations that threaten their position often by purchasing competing firms
according to kurz the concentration of economic power and with it political power in the major technology companies has dangerous consequences
monopoly profits have risen dramatically in the last three decades from near zero in the early to trillion xe equivalent to percent of total us corporate income xe in during the same period monopoly power caused the combined shares of wages and interest paid to capital to decline by percentage points
the result is cascading effect caused
both by fueling the rise of corporate monopoly power and also by undermining the position of labor it has altered the balance of market power in favor of corporations and against their customers workers and suppliers and it has had profoundly negative impact on lower skill workers in particular
jason furman an economist at harvard who served as chairman of the council of economic advisers under president barack obama pointed out in december paper xe should we be reassured if automation in the future looks like automation in the past xe that
the history of automation xe and how the economy has handled it over the last several decades xe suggests that even if ai is similar to previous waves of automation that should not be entirely comforting since technological advances in recent decades have brought tremendous benefits but have also contributed to increasing inequality and falling labor force participation
furman rejects the argument that automation will lead to the permanent elimination of jobs
the concern is not that robots will take human jobs and render humans unemployable the traditional economic arguments against that are borne out by centuries of experience
instead furman contends that the problem lies in xe cthe process of turnover xe which xe ccould lead to sustained periods of time with large fraction of people not working xe in the short run
not all workers will have the training or ability to find the new jobs created by ai moreover this xe cshort run xe could last for decades and in fact the economy could be in series of xe cshort runs xe for even longer
short run that lasts for decades xe or series of short runs that last even longer xe would seem to warrant grave alarm
while much of the focus on job losses resulting from robotization and trade has been on men january study led by saadia zahidi head of education gender and work at the world economic forum found that xe camong the workers affected by labor market disruptions under both models larger share xe percent xe are projected to be female xe
separate study of the potential consequences of automation in england xe managing automation employment inequality and ethics in the digital age xe written by carys roberts mathew lawrence and loren king researchers at the institute for public policy research found that
of all the jobs in the uk greater proportion of those held by women compared to men are likely to be technically automatable and women make up smaller proportion of people in high skill occupations that are resilient to automation or complemented by technology
among liberal leaning economists and public policy experts there is loose consensus on what should be done to manage the adverse consequences of both automation and trade
furman lists some initiatives
expanding education and training so more people have skills that complement and benefit from innovations increasing the progressivity of the tax system to make sure that everyone shares in the overall benefits of the economy and expanding institutional support for higher wages including higher minimum wage and stronger collective bargaining and other forms of worker voice
other related proposals include major increase in the earned income tax credit focus on job specific training at community colleges portable pensions liberalization of occupational licensing and more controversially the creation of universal basic income
these proposals xe some underwhelming or undoable xe find strong support among democratic elected officials
still opposition from republicans is adamant xe not only do they oppose increased domestic spending but it appears to be in the political interests of the party to exacerbate the negative consequences of automation and free trade
david autor an economist at examined the political consequences in congressional districts hurt by increased trade with china and found significant increase in the election of very conservative republicans
using the same techniques to examine the election autor calculated that if the post increase in china trade had been half as large as it in fact was hillary clinton would have won majorities in michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin that would have been enough to make her the victor in the electoral college as the accompanying graphic shows there is also dose effect
expanding on autor xe work andrea cerrato and francesco ruggieri of the university of chicago xe booth school of business and federico maria ferrara of the university of geneva wrote in their march paper xe why does import competition favor republicans localized trade shocks voting behavior and scapegoating in the xe
rather than directly opposing free trade policies individuals in import exposed communities tend to target scapegoats such as immigrants and minorities this drives support for right wing candidates as they compete electorally by targeting out groups
the authors conclude that in areas affected by trade the scapegoating of immigrants xe ctakes place across the board and is not limited to manufacturing workers xe
in other words job losses and plant closings are political gold mine for the republican party crucial to their victories in house and presidential races and almost certainly in senate gubernatorial and state legislative races as well
in highly polarized times when partisans view victory by the opposition as threat to the nation republicans will easily find ways to rationalize continued economic deterioration and the ongoing demonization of immigrants and minorities they xe ve had lot of practice and they have effectively boxed themselves into scapegoat strategy that capitalizes on xe instead of improving xe the suffering of many of their most loyal supporters
the hard core of trump xe voters xe more than half of all republican voters don xe just approve of him but strongly approve xe have in turn demonstrated willingness to deify the president no matter what he does or says xe deification dependent in no small part on trump xe adoption of new communications technologies like twitter
the determination of the trump wing of the republican party to profiteer on technologically driven economic and cultural upheaval xe and the success of this strategy to date xe suggests that the party will continue on its path for this reason and many others it is critically important that democrats develop more far reaching understanding of the disruptive technologically fueled economic and cultural forces that are now shaping american politics xe if they intend to steer the country in more constructive direction that is

when akihiko kondo year old school administrator in tokyo strolled down the aisle in white tuxedo in november his mother was not among the well wishers in attendance for her he said xe cit was not something to celebrate xe
you might see why the bride songstress with aquamarine twin tails named hatsune miku is not only world famous recording artist who fills up arenas throughout japan she is also hologram
mr kondo insists the wedding was not stunt but triumph of true love after years of feeling ostracized by real life women for being an anime otaku or geek he considers himself sexual minority facing discrimination
xe cit xe simply not right xe he told the the japan times xe cit xe as if you were trying to talk gay man into dating woman or lesbian into relationship with man xe
we live in an era when rapid advances in robotics and artificial intelligence are colliding with an expanding conception of sexual identity this comes quickly on the heels of growing worldwide acceptance of gay trans and bisexual people
now you may describe yourself as polyamorous or demisexual xe that last one is people who only feel sexual attraction in close emotional relationships perhaps you best identify as aromantic that xe people who don xe feel romance or skoliosexual that xe primary attraction to people of no or multiple or complex genders
self identification is not the same as identity and some classes of description now may be closer to metaphor but the idea that flesh and blood humans may actually forge fulfilling emotional or even sexual relationships with digital devices is no longer confined to dystopian science fiction movies like xe cex machina xe and xe cher xe stories in which lonely techies fall too hard for software driven femme fatales
in real life pioneers of human android romance now have name xe cdigisexuals xe which some academics and futurists have suggested constitutes an emergent sexual identity
whether the notion is absurd inevitable or offensive it raises more than few questions for starters in world where sex toys that respond and give feedback and artificial intelligence powered sex robots are inching toward the mainstream are digisexuals fringe group destined to remain buried in the sexual underground or in culture permeated with online pornography sexting and tinder swiping isn xe everyone closet digisexual
mr kondo is not the only person to go public about his deep feelings for digital apparatus in recent years
in frenchwoman identified only as xe clilly xe told the media that xe ci xe really and only attracted by the robots xe she claimed to be engaged to printed robot she had designed and said xe cmy only two relationships with men have confirmed my love orientation because dislike really physical contact with human flesh xe

neil mcarthur an associate professor of philosophy at the university of manitoba and markie twist professor of human development and family studies at the university of wisconsin stout published paper last year called xe the rise of digisexuality xe it appeared in the journal sexual and relationship therapy and was picked up by media outlets as diverse as vice and breitbart
the authors delineated between xe cfirst wave xe digisexuality online pornography hookup apps sexting and electronic sex toys where the tech is simply delivery system for sexual fulfillment and xe csecond wave xe digisexuality those practitioners form deeper relationships through immersive technologies like virtual reality augmented reality and equipped sex robots sometimes obviating the need for human partner altogether
dr twist who also runs clinical practice in family and sex therapy said she has had several patients in their and who qualify as second wave digisexuals
xe cwhat they xe ve been into is sex tech toys they can control with their tech devices that attach to their penis or their vulva xe she said xe cthey haven xe had contact with humans and really don xe have any interest in sex with people this is what they want to be doing and if they could afford sex robot they would xe

each technological leap is new chance to blur the lines between cybersex and real sex
consider the spread of deepfakes deceptively realistic videos made using artificial intelligence software one use of them can be to graft celebrity xe face onto the body of pornographic actress they have become so common that one frequent victim scarlett johansson recently threw up her hands about eliminating them
xe ci think it xe useless pursuit legally xe she told the washington post xe cmostly because the internet is vast wormhole of darkness that eats itself xe
but blurred lines do not have to be bad thing they may even be inevitable said bryony cole the founder of future of sex media company in new york that produces podcasts seminars and research on contemporary sexuality
xe cin the future the term xe digisexual xe will not be relevant xe ms cole said in an email xe csubsequent generations will have never known distinction between their online and offline lives they may grow up with sex education chatbots make love to the universe in their own created world or meet their significant other through hologram this will be as normal as the sex education we had in schools using vhs tapes xe
but is robot love in any way fulfilling clearly sexual gratification comes in many forms recent study of anonymously posted online comments published in the international journal of sexual health chronicled the wide variety of seemingly nonsexual experiences that can produce orgasms riding in vehicles exercise eating and auditory stimulation to cite just few
xe cresearch already shows that people can achieve orgasm with inanimate objects and we already see how people have longing for their tech devices and feel separation anxiety when they are not around xe dr twist said xe ci think it xe easily possible that people might develop actual love for their technology they already come up with affectionate names for their cars and boats xe

xe cdigital sexuality allows for possibilities of anonymity gender bending fetish play and other modes of experimentation with degree of safety and autonomy that xe not present in the physical world xe ms witt wrote in an email
even as digisexuality enjoys first flush as nascent rights movement it also may turn out to be as messy and complicated as traditional sex
xe cyou have to separate between the people who use sex robots as fetish or want to have complete control of sexual relationship and those who use programmable doll as safe and predictable partner that allows them therapeutic growth xe said pamela rutledge psychologist in corona del mar calif who conducts research on social behavior involving technology for corporate clients

can have conversation with google assistant or will there be an update in the future that will let me have one
google assistant the company xe voice based helper software that is similar to amazon xe alexa apple xe siri and microsoft xe cortana software can already hold basic two way conversations based on spoken or typed questions and commands however more intricate interaction with all these virtual assistant apps is coming as companies expand their research into the scientific areas of artificial intelligence machine learning and natural language processing for those with privacy concerns keep in mind that most virtual assistant software is designed to collect personal data
the google assistant software is available as an app for android and ios devices built into google home and other speakers android based wearables cars televisions smart home appliances and other gear if you are not sure how to talk to the program the google assistant site has lengthy list of the questions commands and topics that you can use with the software complete with suggestions on how to phrase your requests
you can for example tell google assistant to remember where you parked your car and then ask the software to remind you of the location later for those with google home speakers the company recently released series of routines which run through set of regular daily tasks like adjusting the thermostat and lights before reporting the traffic and weather as you wake up
when you ask google assistant will start conversation with third party chatbot personalities like the hogwarts sorting hat or bobo the panda the cyber argument bot on the site can even pit google home speaker against nearby amazon alexa powered device for the curious video clips of chatbots arguing are available as is an online publication called chatbots magazine
but beyond novelty applications google and the other companies are pushing to develop conversational user interfaces for their products to make them more useful and able to handle complex sets of tasks an online guide for google assistant developers can give you an idea of how apps are designed to work with the software and you will most likely see software updates to google assistant as the software becomes more advanced
amazon apple and microsoft have similar developer programs for their own virtual assistants to help inspire its developers even more amazon last year created the alexa prize contest to advance conversational artificial intelligence with financial reward to the research team that creates the best xe csocialbot xe that can xe ccan converse coherently and engagingly with humans on range of current events and popular topics such as entertainment sports politics technology and fashion xe

san francisco xe in october the chinese province of guangdong xe the manufacturing center on the southern coast that drives percent of the country xe economy xe stopped publishing monthly report on the health of its local factories
for five consecutive months this key economic index had shown drop in factory production as the united states applied billions of dollars in tariffs on chinese exports then amid an increasingly bitter trade war between the united states and china the government authorities in beijing shut the index down
small start up in san francisco began rebuilding the index lifting information from photos and infrared images of guangdong xe factories captured by satellites orbiting overhead the company spaceknow is now selling this information to hedge funds banks and other market traders looking for an edge
high altitude surveillance was once the domain of global superpowers now growing number of start ups are turning it into business aiming to sell insights gleaned from cameras and other sensors installed on small and inexpensive xe cube satellites xe
the companies and governments that spent decades using internet services cameras and other devices to collect data on regular people may soon get taste of their own information technology
xe cbusinesses will not be able to hide from competitors or regulators or watchdogs xe said mark johnson chief executive and co founder of descartes labs another satellite information start up xe cthey need to realize that their traditional competitive advantage xe information xe will be available to everyone xe
nearly earth observation satellites were launched over the last decade according to euroconsult research firm that tracks the space market in the next years more will follow them into orbit training an increasingly wide array of sensors on the planet
orbital insight in palo alto calif is one of the first companies to build business around cube satellite data sitting in orbital xe offices on recent afternoon james crawford the company xe founder and chief executive who goes by jimi opened his laptop and pulled up report on three big name retailers penney macy xe and sears
based on the company xe satellite data color coded line graph showed steady drop in the number of cars parked outside the thousands of stores operated by the three retailers the drop was particularly steep for sears which had filed for bankruptcy just days earlier xe cthis is one of the reasons they xe ve been under so much pressure xe mr crawford said
you don xe need satellite photos to know that sears is failing companies like orbital insight are typically tight lipped when it comes to more important data xe as are their customers xe mainly because they see this information as competitive advantage
but the line graph showed how mr crawford and his start up can target the performance of individual businesses orbital insight tracks activity in more than retail parking lots across the country and it monitors the levels of more than oil tanks around the world
not surprisingly orbital insight and spaceknow said some of their customers use this satellite data to track the progress of their direct competitors though those customers and their competitors are very reluctant to talk about it
mr crawford believes the satellite analysis will ultimately lead to more efficient markets and better understanding of the global economy fred abrahams researcher with the advocacy group human rights watch sees it as check on the world xe companies and governments
mr abrahams and his team use satellite imagery to track everything from illegal mining and logging operations to large scale home demolitions xe cthis is why we are so committed to these technologies xe he said xe cthey make it that much harder to hide large scale abuses xe
all of this is being driven by drop in the cost of building launching and operating satellites today million satellite that weighs less than pounds can capture significantly sharper images than million pound satellite built in the late that allows companies to put up dozens of devices each of which can focus on particular area of the globe or on particular kind of data collection as result more companies are sending more satellites into orbit and these satellites are generating more data
and recent advances in artificial intelligence allow machines to analyze this data with greater speed and accuracy xe cthe future is automation with humans only looking at the very interesting stuff xe mr crawford said
orbital insight does not operate its own satellites nor does spaceknow or descartes labs the start ups buy their data from growing number of satellite operators and they build the automated systems that analyze the data pinpointing objects like cars buildings mines and oil tankers in high resolution photos and other images
now satellite operators are building similar systems selling analysis as well as the raw data the market topped billion in by it will reach billion according to euroconsult
what began with satellite cameras is rapidly expanding to infrared sensors that detect heat xe chyperspectral xe sensors that identify minerals vegetation and other materials and radar scanners that can build three dimensional images of the landscape below as it reconstructs the guangdong economic index spaceknow uses infrared imagery which can help show activity around roughly factories and other industrial sites in the province
after new satellite went up in december virginia start up called hawkeye will soon track wireless signals xe way of understanding the behavior of everything from cellphone networks to cargo ships this could provide new insight in the progress of cellular companies like at amp and verizon including how many cellular towers are in operation how active they are and what technologies and wireless bands are being used
but as technology improves and costs drop some still warn satellite intelligence gathering has its limits finding useful information in satellite imagery can be expensive said shawana johnson veteran of satellite intelligence work who is now the president of global marketing insights consulting firm dedicated to this area
xe cyou have to want to look at variety of activities across the earth and look at them daily xe or weekly xe for the cost to makes sense xe she said
others question how useful this data is particularly for market traders john alberg data and machine learning specialist who co founded the investment firm euclidean technologies said traders could find more important and detailed information about companies here on earth
xe csatellite imagery is narrow niche xe he said
mr johnson of descartes labs acknowledged that satellite data is not always as useful as it seems to be descartes and other companies are still searching for the best ways to use this new trove of information
the data collected by spaceknow provides rough guide to factory production in guangdong said jeremy fand the spaceknow chief executive xe cwe can see when activity is growing xe and slowing xe he said but it is by no means as detailed or as reliable as the information guangdong officials were collecting for their original index
in january one satellite also provided reminder that this is far more complicated technology than smartphones and street cameras the worldview satellite operated by digital globe suddenly went dark
xe cspace is cool but it takes long time to get things right xe mr johnson said xe cyou can xe just send technician into space xe

the muir woods national monument the grove of centuries old coastal redwoods in marin county is undergoing similar multimillion dollar transformation albeit more gradually in january the park instituted mandatory parking reservation system to mitigate overcrowding shuttle bus from other parking areas also requires reservations
the result has been percent reduction in the number of visitors to muir woods which is across the golden gate bridge from san francisco visitors numbered in april this year compared with during the same month last year according to the park service

san francisco xe in an open letter posted to microsoft xe internal message board on tuesday more than employees protested the software maker xe work with immigration and customs enforcement and asked the company to stop working with the agency which has been separating migrant parents and their children at the border with mexico
xe cwe believe that microsoft must take an ethical stand and put children and families above profits xe said the letter which was addressed to the chief executive satya nadella the letter pointed to million contract that microsoft has with ice for processing data and artificial intelligence capabilities
calling the separation of families xe cinhumane xe the employees added xe cas the people who build the technologies that microsoft profits from we refuse to be complicit we are part of growing movement comprised of many across the industry who recognize the grave responsibility that those creating powerful technology have to ensure what they build is used for good and not for harm xe
the letter is part of wave of tech workers mobilizing this week against the trump administration xe new xe czero tolerance xe policy that refers for criminal prosecution all immigrants apprehended crossing the border without authorization the policy has resulted in about children being separated from their migrant parents raising bipartisan outcry
at silicon valley companies including google apple and facebook employees have in recent days circulated internal emails asking for donations to nonprofit groups that support immigrants many have shared information about protests in san francisco and washington and some of the workers have spoken to their managers about the issue or called on internal message boards for their chief executives to respond
the activity has had an effect late on tuesday after microsoft xe employee letter went up the company released memo from mr nadella in which he called the immigration policy xe ccruel and abusive xe and said microsoft was not working with the federal government on any projects to separate families microsoft xe president brad smith also published blog post titled xe cthe country needs to get immigration right xe
their comments came after other tech chief executives spoke up on tuesday apple xe chief timothy cook in an interview with the irish times called the immigration policy xe cheartbreaking xe elon musk the chief executive of tesla and spacex tweeted that he was xe ctop donor xe to the american civil liberties union and said that xe cif there is some way for me to help these kids will do so xe sundar pichai of google dara khosrowshahi of uber and chuck robbins of cisco also tweeted their opposition to the policy
on facebook two former employees of the social network started fund raiser on saturday to collect for migrants who needed legal assistance because of the new policy by tuesday afternoon the effort had garnered more than million from donors who included numerous tech workers according to spokeswoman for the fund raising drive
among the donors were facebook xe chief executive mark zuckerberg and its chief operating officer sheryl sandberg facebook spokesman said in facebook post on tuesday mr zuckerberg called for more donations and said the policy of splitting up immigrant children from their families needed to be stopped ms sandberg in her own facebook post called the cries of the children taken from their parents xe cunbearable xe and added that the practice xe cneeds to end now xe
the activity by tech workers is reminiscent of protests in january when many silicon valley employees were up in arms over an executive order from president trump that suspended immigration from seven mostly muslim countries at the time google employees held rallies to object amazon and expedia were among the companies that filed in court to stop the order many tech companies comprise workers who are first generation immigrants or who grew up in immigrant families
since then tech workers have watched their companies increasingly come under scrutiny for their moral and ethical behavior many tech employees have begun organizing against actions by their own companies xe in april for example thousands of google employees signed letter protesting the company xe involvement in pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence in weaponry
on monday the also demanded that amazon stop selling facial recognition software tool called rekognition to police and other government entities because it feared it could be used to unfairly target immigrants amazon did not immediately respond to request for comment
microsoft based in redmond wash publicly promoted its work with ice in january in blog post citing it as an example of the success of its technology
at the same time microsoft has been positioning itself as tech xe moral leader mr nadella and mr smith have publicly said they want to protect user privacy and establish ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence
xe cwe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do xe mr nadella said at microsoft xe developer conference last month
some microsoft executives earlier objected to the trump administration xe new immigration policy on sunday mr smith penned linkedin post saying the news of migrant children being taken from their families was xe cespecially poignant xe
yet criticism of microsoft xe work with ice began to grow one microsoft engineer larry osterman tweeted on monday to ask how working with ice matched with the company xe xe cethical stances xe
mat marquis an independent developer who works with microsoft also said in tweet on monday that he no longer planned to work with the company because of its ice contract when he receives his last payment from microsoft he said he plans to donate the money to group providing support to families that had been separated at the border
late monday microsoft issued statement saying that it was not working with federal agencies to separate children from their families at the border and that it was not aware of its services or products being used for that purpose it also said it was xe cdismayed xe by the immigration policy and urged that it be changed
but for many microsoft employees that was not satisfactory group of about dozen employees began working together to draft the protest letter in which they said the company xe statement xe cdoes not go far enough xe
the employees continued xe cwe are providing the technical undergirding in support of an agency that is actively enforcing this inhumane policy xe
the letter added that microsoft should not only cancel its contract with ice but be open to review of its contracts with government agencies domestically and internationally and that it should create policy stating it would not work with those xe cwho violate international human rights law xe
microsoft declined to comment on the employee letter which was posted internally on tuesday afternoon within hours it had received more than signatures
it was only later that the messages from mr nadella and mr smith decrying the immigration policy were released xe cwe will always stand for immigration policies that preserve every person xe dignity and human rights xe mr nadella said

that xe the premise behind one of the hottest developments in the beauty business customizable hair care
by courtney rubin
when ren xc xa bibby has good hair day people stop her on the street and tell her they love her short curly hair on bad hair day though xe ci look like dandelion puff xe said ms bibby graphic designer in tucson
over the years ms bibby who is of mixed race descent and describes her hair as xe ccoarse but not black hair xe has spent hundreds of dollars trying products to maximize the good days and minimize the bad six months ago she found winner custom made conditioner from start up called prose she does not shampoo her hair
xe cthe first day used it got out of the shower and the curl was already in my hair xe said ms bibby who used to have to work to bring the curl back xe cit xe probably taken minutes off my routine xe
prose whose founders include former xe or xc xa al vice president uses quiz artificial intelligence algorithms and square foot production space in the sunset park section of brooklyn to create what it hopes is each customer xe ideal product
the company has shipped bottles and will reach million in monthly sales by its first birthday in january and it is one of the biggest and most successful entrants in what has fast become one of the hottest spaces in the beauty industry customizable hair care on monday the company announced that it had raised million in new funding
another start up the four year old function of beauty uses its own quiz and algorithms along with willy wonka esque square foot factory of custom built machines it has sold million bottles according to zahir dossa massachusetts institute of technology trained computer scientist and the company xe chief executive prices start at for an eight ounce set of shampoo and conditioner
there is more competition coming schwarzkopf global cosmetics giant is conducting trials of custom products in japan with plans to bring them to the united states its system includes hand held device with an infrared sensor that can detect the hair xe molecular structure and analyze its moisture levels an in salon machine that looks like the world xe fanciest coffee maker whips up products in seconds along with label printed with bar code for reordering
unlike brands that offer different products for each hair xe cgoal xe say preserving color or thickening hair companies that customize say they can combine ingredients that will fulfill all your hair needs in single shampoo conditioner or hair mask
prose also adjusts based on environmental factors which it gleans from your zip code for example if it thinks you may be spending lot of time in indoor heating because it xe cold outside it adds corn derivatives that smooth and condition to fight static
xe cwe tackle all your problems xe said arnaud plas the chief executive of prose sitting in the company xe soho conference room which is decorated with illustrations of coconut mint and other good for hair ingredients xe cwe xe re not going to make you compromise xe the company says it has tested which ingredients could cancel one another xe benefits
it xe probably not surprising that there are skeptics maryanne senna dermatologist and the director of the hair academic innovative research unit at massachusetts general hospital in boston is unconvinced that customizable shampoos and conditioners work much better than standard ones
xe cthere are some things we very clearly know can be drying but then there xe lot of stuff they use that has no evidence to back it up xe dr senna said xe cwhether it xe the hair holy grail comes down to perception xe
unless patients have very oily hair or dandruff or known sensitivity or allergy she does not recommend specific products she tells them that everyone is different and they have to find one that works for them
perry romanowski cosmetic chemist and founder of thebeautybrains com site where scientists examine product ingredients and industry claims called customization xe ca marketing gimmick xe
xe cthere is nothing measurably different about their formulas in terms of performance xe mr romanowski said
he has run blinded home use tests of the top selling shampoos and conditioners pantene turned out to make the best performing product
moreover he found that expensive shampoos don xe work better than cheap ones but expensive conditioners work better than really inexpensive ones like or suave he said that xe because the pricey conditioners have more types of nourishing ingredients which all work differently and together are more effective
still he said xe csuper expensive ones aren xe better than pantene xe
but this is where things get knotty major driver of whether product works xe or really whether customer thinks it does xe is fragrance which of course has no visible effect unless you xe re allergic to it in its early days function of beauty had to spend more time tweaking scents than algorithms
xe cman people care lot more about fragrance than ever thought they would xe said mr dossa who when he started the company had shaved head but now has man bun so he can test products xe ccustomers won xe properly assess your product if they xe re not happy with the fragrance xe
prose does not offer customers who want moisturizing shampoo the option of choosing citrus fragrance mr plas learned from his time at xe or xc xa al that customers will insist the product doesn xe work because they associate that smell with grease removal xe cthen we give them the exact same formula with different scent and they think it xe great xe he said shaking his head
another thing customers can xe yet choose easily to ban particular ingredient because of allergies and sensitivities function of beauty is vegan and gluten free prose allows you to choose those options both allow you to avoid fragrance but you have to contact customer service to ban specific ingredient
lacey harris an athletic trainer in lemoore calif is allergic to coconut oil an ingredient contained in her function of beauty products she switched to prose which purely by luck didn xe add that to her shampoo and conditioner
ms harris said she could really tell how much volume and wave the prose products added to her hair when she bought dove which she once used to share with her husband on backpacking trip
xe ci couldn xe wait to get back to my custom shampoo xe she said

cambridge mass xe hal abelson renowned computer scientist at the massachusetts institute of technology was working the classroom coffee cup in hand pacing back and forth the subject was artificial intelligence and his students last week were mainly senior policymakers from countries in the nation organization for economic cooperation and development
mr abelson began with brisk history of machine learning starting in the next came description of how the technology works hands on project using computer vision models and then case studies the goal was to give the policymakers from countries like france japan and sweden sense of the technology xe strengths and weaknesses emphasizing the crucial role of human choices
xe cthese machines do what they do because they are trained xe mr abelson said
the class was part of three day gathering at including expert panels debate and discussion as the organization for economic cooperation and development seeks to agree on recommendations for artificial intelligence policy by this summer
but where are policymakers supposed to even start artificial intelligence seems to be everywhere much hyped much feared yet little understood some proclaim will be an elixir of prosperity while others warn it will be job killer even an existential threat to humanity
the organization xe declarations when they come will not carry the force of law but its recommendations have track record of setting standards in many countries including guidelines going back to that called on nations to enact legislation to protect privacy and defined personal data as any information that can be used to identify an individual
the recommendations carry weight because the organization xe mission is to foster responsible economic development balancing innovation and social protections
xe cwe xe re hoping to get out in front and help create some sort of policy coherence xe said andrew wyckoff the group xe director for science technology and innovation
here are few themes that emerged at the gathering xe ideas that could help shape the debate for years to come
regulation is coming that xe good thing rules of competition and behavior are the foundation of healthy growing markets
that was the consensus of the policymakers at but they also agreed that artificial intelligence raises some fresh policy challenges
today xe machine learning systems are so complex digesting so much data that explaining how they make decisions may be impossible so do you just test for results do you put self driving cars through driver xe test if an system predicts breast cancer better than humans on average do you just go with the machine probably
xe cit xe very clear xe you have to use it xe said regina barzilay an computer scientist and breast cancer survivor
but handing off growing array of decisions is uncomfortable terrain practical rules that reassure the public are the only path toward adoption
xe cif you want people to trust this stuff government has to play role xe said daniel weitzner principal research scientist at the computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory who was policy adviser in the obama administration
new regulation is often equated with slower growth but the policymakers at the event said they did not want to stop the train instead they said they want their countries fully on board nations that have explicit strategies like france and canada consider the technology an engine of growth and seek to educate and recruit the next generation of researchers
xe cmachine learning is the next truly disruptive technology xe said elissa strome who oversees strategy at the canadian institute for advanced research government funded organization xe cthere are huge opportunities for machine learning in fields like energy environment transportation and health care xe
international cooperation the attendees said would help ensure that policymaking was not simply left by default to the superpowers the united states which is member of the organization for economic cooperation and development and china which is not
xe cwe think there can be new model for the development of artificial intelligence that differs from china or california xe said bertrand pailh xc xa the national coordinator for france xe strategy
in the view of mr pailh xc xa and others china is government controlled surveillance state in the american model coming from silicon valley in california handful of internet companies become big winners and society is treated as data generating resource to be strip mined
xe cthe era of moving fast and breaking everything is coming to close xe said david edelman an adviser in the obama administration and the director of the project on technology policy and national security at
in japan artificial intelligence is being seized as lever to spur dynamism in its stodgy hierarchical corporate culture japan is investing heavily to encourage the development of technology with particular emphasis on xe cstart ups small companies and young people xe said osamu sudoh professor at the university of tokyo and senior adviser to the japanese government on strategy
one specific policy issue dominated all others the collection handling and use of data
fast computers and clever algorithms are important but the recent explosion of digital data xe from the web smartphones sensors genomics and elsewhere xe is the oxygen of modern
xe caccess to data is going to be the most important thing xe for advancing science said antonio torralba director of the quest for intelligence project so much data is held privately that without rules on privacy and liability data will not be shared and advances in fields like health care will by stymied
artificial intelligence can magnify the danger of data driven injustice public interest advocates point to the troubling missteps with the technology xe software for example that fails to recognize the faces of black women or crime prediction programs used in courtrooms that discriminate against african americans
in such cases data is the problem the results were biased because the data that went into them was biased xe skewed toward white males for facial recognition and the comparatively high percentage of african americans in the prison population
xe care we just going to make the current racist system more effective or are we going to get rid of embedded bias xe asked carol rose executive director of the american civil liberties union of massachusetts
these are issues of both technology design and policy xe cwho is being mistreated who is being left out xe mr abelson asked the class xe cas you think about regulation that is what you should be thinking about xe

san francisco xe flying cars are just starting to inch their way out of science fiction but that is not stopping some companies from planning for flying taxi services
growing collection of tech companies aircraft manufacturers automakers and investors are betting that fleets of battery powered aircraft will give rise to air taxi services perhaps as soon as the next decade some of those taxis the companies hope may even use artificial intelligence to fly themselves
the deal making technology exploration and perhaps wishful thinking around this new sort of flying transportation xe please the companies ask don xe call them flying cars xe are reminiscent of the work done on self driving cars just few years ago
no one can say for certain if these new vehicles will turn out to be real business but many companies are already worried about being left behind
the european aerospace company airbus said tuesday that it was making an investment in blade an aviation start up in new york and forming partnership to expand blade xe helicopter hailing service in more cities around the world last week dara khosrowshahi uber xe chief executive said he expected the ride hailing company to start flying passengers on service called uber air in five to years
in november boeing acquired aurora flight sciences company specializing in flight systems for pilotless aircraft for an undisclosed sum before the acquisition aurora had been working with uber to develop flying taxi and joby aviation start up in santa cruz calif building its own air taxi said this month that it had raised million in venture funding from consortium of investors including the venture capital arms of intel toyota motor and jetblue airways
xe cthis is the natural progression of the vehicles we make xe said ben bridge head of global business for airbus helicopters xe cwe want seat at the table and voice in the conversation that is happening xe
flying cars even played bit role in the recently settled legal fight over trade secrets between uber and waymo the self driving car service spun out of google
in court testimony this month travis kalanick uber xe former chief executive said he had heard that larry page xe the chief executive of waymo xe parent company alphabet who has side project building new types of aircraft xe was upset because uber was xe cdoing their thing xe with flying cars
whatever you imagine flying car to be xe stop what these companies envision is something like helicopter but much quieter and more affordable think of hobbyist xe drone but big enough to fit people it would in theory be welcome in urban environments and affordable to more than well heeled businesspeople at least that xe the dream
before there can be too much enthusiasm for these flying taxi services it xe worth noting that self driving cars have yet to turn into notable business for anyone despite about decade of research at tech giants like google and billions in investment from silicon valley and the auto industry
regulators are just starting to agree on rules for large scale tests of self driving cars on public roads how would they deal with flying taxis the details of the future service are far xe very far xe from being ironed out
still there are some reasons for the new enthusiasm battery improvements and the wide use of drones have spawned technological breakthroughs the taxis would take off and land vertically like helicopter so they xe take up less room because they would be battery powered they would be more environmentally friendly
for now airbus executives hope to gain from blade xe experience with an app that allows customers to reserve seat on helicopter airbus is expected to invest up to million in blade which would represent about percent stake in the company according to person who is familiar with the transaction but not permitted to discuss the investment details publicly
both companies see helicopters as an intermediate step until new type of aircraft and taxi service hits the market rob wiesenthal blade xe chief executive said quieter and less expensive alternative to helicopters xe copens up whole new world xe
airbus said it was preparing for test flight by year end for its cityairbus aircraft which carries up to four passengers and can reach cruising speed of about miles per hour it plans to deploy the cityairbus in
uber has said it expects to begin testing of its urban air taxis in the dallas fort worth area los angeles and dubai in the company has landed exclusive deals for vertical takeoff and landing spots with real estate companies including in the dallas fort worth area
uber declared its interest with its uber elevate initiative in forecasting future when it could offer minute uber air rides from san francisco to san jose for the mile ride with uber pool its car pooling option usually takes about two hours in rush hour traffic and costs
it did not put date on that future
in concept video for uber elevate woman opens the uber app which gives her choice of taking ride with uber pool uberx or uber air she enters nearby building and rides the elevator to the top floor where she boards an air taxi in uber skyport
uber is also establishing performance guidelines for its flying taxis including asking that the new aircraft make only one quarter of the noise of small four seat helicopter uber also has supplier deals in place with five manufacturers including textron xe bell helicopter
xe cwe believe the best way to get this idea off the ground is to partner with world class companies and stakeholders that have diverse set of specializations xe an uber spokesman matt wing said in statement
daniel wiegand co founder and the chief executive of the german air taxi company lilium said investors considered him totally crazy when he pitched the company in
xe cit has completely changed xe mr wiegand said like many of his competitors he dismisses the phrase xe cflying cars xe because other companies are working on cars that fly as well as drive on the road in september lilium announced that it had raised million from investors including the chinese internet giant tencent
and then there is google xe or to be more specific mr page google xe co founder and alphabet xe chief executive he has invested part of his personal wealth in kitty hawk start up that has demonstrated personal aircraft that flies using propellers over water kitty hawk division called zee aero is also reportedly working on an air taxi concept aircraft
mr kalanick said he told mr page that he believed flying service xe csounds pretty cool xe even though uber wasn xe building one but once the aircraft are available he said xe ci will make sure that our million or so customers at the time can push button and get flying car xe

hi xe steve lohr write about the technology industry from the old titans like ibm to start ups working on the future of artificial intelligence
in this week xe newsletter we xe re largely taking break from the consumer internet giants and the various controversies swirling around them exception amazon xe surprise announcement on thursday to abandon its plans to build headquarters in new york see below
instead we xe re going to look at recent research and reports that track how digital technology is moving into mainstream industries and the implications
let xe start with smart piece this week by my colleague erin griffith xe cthe next wave of xe unicorn xe start ups xe erin asked cb insights research firm that studies start ups and venture capital to create list of the next wave of young companies likely to reach valuations of billion or more she then reported on some of the companies
the first round of well known unicorns led by uber and airbnb she writes exploited smartphones and cloud computing to upend old line businesses the next companies poised to become unicorns are going narrower deeper and into more fields
xe cthey largely focus on software xe she writes xe cfor specific industries like farms banks and life sciences companies xe
that kind of broad based adoption across the nation xe trillion economy is what will deliver growth and higher living standards for many yet the advance of data driven artificial intelligence will also provide real world evidence of how much and how quickly this technology may widen income disparities and kill jobs
the short answer it seems is not as fast as techno pessimists fear xe progress is impressive but limited an article this week by cade metz xe ca shows promise assisting physicians xe underlines that point
the piece describes an research program whose accuracy matched or slightly surpassed human physicians in diagnosing common childhood diseases like influenza the software was trained on the medical histories lab tests and other clinical data in more than electronic health records of children in southern china
it was an encouraging demonstration but the experimental system relied on the easy access to personal data in china where privacy regulations are less restrictive and was confined to diagnosing common ailments
that step by step approach is the counsel for business in new book by thomas davenport xe the ai advantage how to put the artificial intelligence revolution to work xe mit press mr davenport professor of information technology and management at babson college is seasoned expert in using digital data to streamline operations and spot opportunities and he xe been at it since well before the current wave which is both technological evolution and branding craze
his advice to mainstream companies is that the best course is often to use basic tools to automate mundane office tasks in operations like accounting billing payments and customer service xe and to avoid xe cmoon shots xe
one of mr davenport xe prime examples of misguided moon shot was ibm xe initial efforts to apply its watson technology to diagnosing cancer that was high profile science project that proved more difficult time consuming and costly than anticipated though ibm continues that work with several leading cancer centers
speaking of ibm the company was out in san francisco this week for its annual think conference which attracted more than attendees its executives presented its watson and cloud technology as the trusted path for companies across the industrial spectrum that want to embrace
ibm cannot compete head on with amazon microsoft and google in the big spending game of building out massive data centers to provide the infrastructure layer of cloud computing to one and all so it is seeking to shift the competition
ibm talks about xe cchapter two xe in the cloud market increasingly it says companies will run not only new applications but also their legacy software on the cloud either private clouds in their own data centers or on ibm xe cloud the next stage of cloud computing virginia rometty ibm xe chief executive told jon fortt of cnbc xe cis going to be driven by the modernization of mission critical apps that xe our sweet spot xe
and in nod to reality ibm announced watson anywhere initiative its technology will run on the popular clouds of amazon microsoft or google as well as ibm xe cloud

xe xa david goodman city hall reporter for the times deftly explained the shifting politics before amazon withdrew its plan in xe cwhy amazon is caught in an unexpected brawl in new york xe
but what happened in queens is part of broader resistance to the tech boom and its consequences after the protests surfaced last year fred wilson the dean of new york venture capitalists told me that xe cit xe partly from sense that amazon coming in is not going to help them and will only drive up their costs to really be success in new york the benefits of the tech sector have to extend to every borough and every neighborhood xe
that concern across the country as technology marches ahead is the subject of lengthy analysis this week by mark muro senior fellow at the brookings institution

palo alto calif xe before the car can drive without human one must first get behind the wheel
as the driver at this company accelerates stops and turns on local streets sensors on the car record what he sees and track how he responds then team of engineers builds software that can learn how to behave from that data
the software is installed in the car and it can drive on its own in the end the car mimics choices made by the human driver
this is how things work at aurora innovation start up founded by three veterans of autonomous vehicle research including chris urmson who previously led the self driving car project at google
the company xe methods are part of change sweeping across the world of self driving cars kind of so called machine learning technology that promises chance for little companies like aurora to compete with the giants of both the tech and automotive industries with it researchers can build and improve autonomous vehicles at far more rapid pace xe one of the reasons aurora believes it can close the gap on companies that have been working on self driving technology for years
on thursday the year old start up said that it had agreed to supply self driving technology to the volkswagen group and hyundai two of the world xe largest car companies johann jungwirth the chief digital officer at the volkswagen group which owns audi porsche and six other major automotive brands including the flagship vw brand said the company has been working with aurora for several months with an eye toward developing both autonomous cars and driverless taxi services
in when mr urmson and his colleagues at google launched the autonomous vehicle movement writing the computer code to guide their vehicles was painstaking line by line effort but in recent years type of computer algorithm called deep neural network has come in from the edges of academia to reinvent the way many technologies are built including autonomous vehicles
these algorithms can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data xe cit used to be that real smart ph sat in cube for six months and they would hand code detector xe that spotted objects on the road mr urmson said during recent interview at aurora xe offices xe cnow you gather the right kind of data and feed it to an algorithm and day later you have something that works as well as that six months of work from the ph xe
the google self driving car project first used the technique to detect pedestrians since then it has applied the same method to many other parts of the car including systems that predict what will happen on the road and plan route forward now the industry as whole is moving in the same direction
but this shift raises questions it is still unclear how regulators and lawyers xe not to mention the general public xe will view these methods because neural networks learn from such large amounts of data relying on hours or even days of calculations they operate in ways that their human designers cannot necessarily anticipate or understand there is no means of determining exactly why machine reaches particular decision
xe cthis is big transition xe said noah goodall who explores regulatory and legal issues surrounding autonomous cars at the virginia transportation research council an arm of the state department of transportation xe cif you start using neural networks to control how car moves and then it crashes how do you explain why it crashed and why it won xe happen again xe
the seeds for this work were planted in working with two other researchers at the university of toronto graduate student named alex krizhevsky built neural network that could recognize photos of everyday objects like flowers dogs and cars by analyzing thousands of flower photos it could learn to recognize flower in matter of days and it performed better than any system coded by hand
soon mr krizhevsky and his collaborators moved to google and over the next few years google and its internet rivals broke new ground in artificial intelligence using these concepts to identify objects in photos and to recognize commands spoken into smartphones translate between languages and respond to internet search queries
over the holiday break at the end of another google researcher anelia angelova asked for mr krizhevsky xe help on the google car project neither of them officially worked on the project they were part of separate lab called google brain but they saw an opportunity
rather than trying to define for computer what pedestrian looked like they created an algorithm that could allow computer to learn what pedestrian looked like by analyzing thousands of street photos their system could begin to identify the visual patterns that define pedestrian like the curve of head or the bend of leg the method was so effective that google began applying the technique to other parts of the project including prediction and planning
xe cit was big turning point xe said dmitri dolgov who was part of google xe original self driving car team and is now chief technology officer at waymo the new company that oversees the project xe was pretty magical xe
mr urmson described this shift in much the same way he believes the continued progress of these and other machine learning methods will be essential to building cars that can match and even exceed the behavior of human drivers
mirroring the work at waymo aurora is building algorithms that can recognize objects on the road and anticipate and react to what other vehicles and pedestrians will do next as mr urmson explained the software can learn what happens when driver turns the vehicle in particular direction at particular speed on particular type of road
learning from human drivers in this way is an evolution of an old idea in the early researchers at carnegie mellon university built car that learned relatively simple behavior last year team of researchers at nvidia the computer chip maker published paper showing how modern hardware can extend the idea to more complex behavior but many researchers question whether carmakers can completely understand why neural networks make particular decisions and rule out unexpected behavior
xe cfor cars or flying aircraft there is lot of concern over neural networks doing crazy things xe said mykel kochenderfer robotics professor who oversees the intelligent systems laboratory at stanford university
some researchers for instance have shown that neural networks trained to identify objects can be fooled into seeing things that aren xe there xe though many including mr kochenderfer are working to develop ways of identifying and preventing unexpected behavior
like waymo toyota and others aurora says that its approach is more controlled than it might seem the company layers cars with backup systems so that if one system fails another can offer safety net and rather than driving the car using single neural network that learns all behavior from one vast pool of data xe the method demonstrated by nvidia xe they break the task into smaller pieces
one system detects traffic lights for example another predicts what will happen next on the road in particular kind of situation third chooses response and so on the company can train and test and retrain each piece
xe chow do you get confidence that something works xe asked drew bagnell machine learning specialist who helped found aurora after leaving the self driving car program at uber xe cyou test it xe
mr goodall the virginia department of transportation researcher said car designers must reassure both regulators and the public that these methods are reliable
xe cthe onus is on them xe he said
an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of researcher at the virginia department of transportation he is noah goodall not goodhall

detroit xe for years as china emerged as the world xe largest producer of automobiles american car companies have wondered when chinese manufacturer would try to enter the united states market
now they have an answer
at the detroit auto show on monday officials of gac motor based in guangzhou outlined broad plan to build up its operations in the united states and begin selling vehicle here next year possibly in partnership with fiat chrysler automobiles
gac also expects to open development center in michigan and design center in los angeles in the first half of this year the executives said the company had already established technology lab in silicon valley last year
xe cwe intend to gain foothold in the xe yu jun gac motor xe president said at news conference xe cif we can make it in the we can make it anywhere and enhance further possibilities of future growth xe
gac xe which sold about vehicles last year and markets several models under the name trumpchi xe is considering selling its car through dealerships tied to fiat chrysler the two companies are already partners in china where gac manufactures jeeps for the italian american automaker
xe cin the first half of this year we will establish north american sales company that will be responsible for developing the dealership network xe mr jun said xe cwe will explore all sorts of channels including partnering with as well as others xe
sergio marchionne fiat chrysler xe chief executive said his company was ready to assist gac xe cwe are talking to them about how and if we can help if they come to the xe mr marchionne told reporters at his own news conference earlier in the day
the potential for cooperation in the united states is sure to fuel further speculation about whether the two companies will move toward an even closer alliance fiat chrysler has been in discussions with number of chinese companies about potential equity investments prospect that took on greater significance after mr marchionne tried and failed to persuade general motors to consider merging with his company in
mr marchionne has said he hopes to merge or partner with another automaker to improve fiat chrysler xe long term prospects as technology and new global markets reshape the industry while the company is profitable it has not earned enough to make significant investments in the kind of technologies that appear crucial to the future of the industry such as electric vehicles and self driving cars
whether or not his company enters partnership with gac or another company mr marchionne will probably not be around to see if it pays off during his news conference he confirmed that this will be his last year running fiat chrysler he began as the chief executive of fiat in and under his direction the company took control of chrysler just as it was undergoing wrenching bankruptcy reorganization engineered by regulators in washington in
mr marchionne said his successor will be named sometime after march when fiat chrysler expected to present new business plan that will serve as road map to guide the company xe operations through two internal candidates richard palmer the chief financial officer and mike manley head of the highly profitable jeep and ram brands are expected to be among the top contenders
mr marchionne said that fiat chrysler xe chas no intention xe of breaking up the company and selling jeep or ram xe cthe answer is no xe he said
but partnership to sell gac cars in the united states could make sense fiat chrysler xe dodge and chrysler brands no longer offer small or mid sized cars having dropped them from their lineups in dealers selling fiat brand small cars meanwhile are desperate for additional models to offer many fiat dealers sell only handful of new cars each month and do most of their business in variety of used models
xe cfiat has limited potential in the xe mr marchionne acknowledged
furthermore fiat chrysler does not have an electric car in its lineup and mr marchionne opposes the idea of investing the money to develop one
xe ci don xe know of any organization making money on electric vehicles xe he said hybrids and electric cars together make up only percent of all new cars sold in the united states he noted xe cthat is not good economic basis in which to do any type of investment xe
some dealers however said they saw need for fiat chrysler to get back into the mid sized car segment and offer at least one electric model xe cit may be shrinking segment but still have customers who want cars xe said wesley lutz owner of extreme dodge in jackson mich xe cand it would be nice to at least have one hybrid and electric vehicle because you do have those green customers out there xe
the first model gac plans to offer in the united states is sport utility vehicle called the gs the engineering center that gac plans to build in or near detroit would help design two additional models that the company plans to introduce in america mr jun said
two models that gac showed off in detroit were making their only stateside appearance small car called the ga and concept for an all electric called the enverge that mr jun said has mile range do not figure in the company xe united states plans

this year three washington based museums of the smithsonian institution deployed half dozen four feet tall humanoid robots nicknamed pepper to answer visitors xe questions and tell stories using voice gestures and an interactive touch screen they also dance play games and pose for selfies
rachel goslins director of the smithsonian xe arts and industries building and overseer of the robots xe deployment said she has been xe cblown away xe by visitors xe reactions to them
pepper she added xe cfeels totally aligned with the museums xe mission we are asking people to be present engaged to have communal experience we xe re not making you look at your phone even more we xe re creating playful joyful human experience xe she said more robots eventually would be rolled out helping to guide the work of the smithsonian xe educators and docents
the museums using pepper are the national museum of african american history and culture the hirshhorn museum and sculpture garden and national museum of african art as well as the smithsonian castle which is using eight robots four of which can travel elsewhere the robot was created by softbank robotics
the smithsonian venture into artificial intelligence to engage visitors is just one example in rapidly moving trend mixing art and technology
artificial intelligence is increasingly being used today by museums of all sizes worldwide which employ it to develop everything from robots chatbots and websites to tools that help them analyze visitor data and their collections and determine admission policies and exhibition content
the akron art museum is encouraging visitors to use their phones to interact with dot its chatbot digital tour guide which sports dark glasses and pink pageboy introduced in august dot is accessible by the facebook messenger platform when visitors enter the museum they are directed to kiosk that explains how dot works
she takes visitors on six stop xe cchoose your own adventure xe tour of the museum xe permanent collection discussing works of art and asking visitors questions in front of sol lewitt mural in the museum xe lobby for example she explains that lewitt did not personally paint the mural but that drafter did she calls this process delegating and asks xe cwhat part of your job do you wish you could assign to someone else xe
mark masuoka director of the museum called dot xe ca great way to connect people with art and each other and she doesn xe require prior knowledge of the artwork xe he said the museum would analyze usage of the chatbot which he said could help it make xe cmore informed decisions about how we want to develop projects and exhibitions xe
the museum of tomorrow in rio de janeiro collaborated with ibm to develop an iris chatbot that uses ibm xe watson artificial intelligence technology and was introduced last year
on arrival museum visitors receive card embedded with chip to use iris when they finish touring the core exhibition iris asks via an ipad xe cafter everything you learned in the main exhibition what are your concerns in today xe world xe
during the conversation that follows the app exchanges data with ibm xe cloud and suggests initiatives suited to the visitors xe concerns basing these in part on personal information the visitors are invited to provide such as their date of birth and where they live
visitors also are encouraged to take selfie for wall at the end of the core exhibition this wall displays visitors xe photographs along with their first names and personal interests the wall also tracks and graphically displays all visitors xe top concerns
the barnes foundation used artificial intelligence when it introduced new collection website last year as part of the celebration of the fifth anniversary of its move to downtown philadelphia
emulating the criteria the museum xe founder albert barnes used to display his art collection in ensembles the new website lets visitors search the collection by visual properties such as light line color and space filtering images according to aesthetic similarities more than of the roughly works in the barnes xe collection have been published on the site the number of visitors going to the barnes xe website has tripled since the new collection display was introduced according to shelley bernstein the museum xe consulting creative technologist
the new museum in new york which was founded in to exhibit new works by living artists has also worked often with artificial intelligence rhizome an affiliate of the museum since that is dedicated to what it calls xe cborn digital art and culture xe recently commissioned project enron email which was developed by sam lavigne and tega brain and explores the more than emails relating to enron xe corporate fraud working with nokia bell labs through new inc the museum xe incubator is fei liu an artist who is teaching robots how to play simple games as way to better understand the human capacity for empathy new inc is also working with channel studio group of artists that is mining two decades of original music to make new interactive apps to create compositions
the museum of modern art is using artificial intelligence to analyze visitors xe comments while the broad in los angeles is using it to analyze visitors xe behavior such as ticket and gift shop purchases and website visits diana pan chief technology officer of moma which is now undergoing expansion said the data produced by artificial intelligence could help it determine new signage and navigation requirements heather hart director of information technology for the broad said the data it collects could not only help it improve ticket distribution and exhibition planning but also possibly what it sells in its gift shop and publishes in its newsletter
artificial intelligence has allowed the art institute of chicago to track how long visitors stay in its galleries leading it to offer more small exhibitions focusing on its permanent collection
and is aiding the conservation and attribution efforts of robert erdmann senior scientist at the rijksmuseum in amsterdam he is developing tools that allow visitors to his museum xe website xe which contains over digital photographs of objects in its collection xe to use artificial intelligence when they try to make comparisons among these objects exploring for example all works xe beside the museum xe famous vermeer painting of milkmaid xe of women preparing food
another possible application of artificial intelligence according to elizabeth merritt director of the american alliance of museums xe center for the future of museums could be the ability of visitors to interact with historical figures at history museums through chatbots developed using the figures xe published writings and archives as well as oral histories
robert stein executive vice president and chief program officer of the american alliance of museums warned that museums must be aware of privacy issues as they use artificial intelligence for example protecting whatever personal information their visitors provide
xe cany time you talk about an emerging technology museums have an important role to play teaching the public about it artificial intelligence is going to be incredibly important in shaping the world we live in in profound ways we need to understand the technology and the issues it raises xe added ms merritt
because of an editing error picture caption in an earlier version of this article misstated the name of an art museum it is the akron art museum not the akron museum of art
an earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that channel studio is working with nokia bell labs through new inc while channel studio is working with new inc it is not working with nokia bell labs

beijing xe the fog of cyberespionage concerns surrounding huawei has for years kept the chinese technology giant largely out of the united states now it has cost the company potentially lucrative business in another country australia
huawei said on thursday that the australian government had barred it and another chinese company zte from providing equipment to support the country xe new telecommunications networks mobile carriers around the world have been preparing to build infrastructure using fifth generation or wireless technology which promises to enable the ultrafast communications necessary for technologies such as self driving cars
on twitter huawei called the decision an xe cextremely disappointing result for consumers xe in statement the company said it xe cwill continue to engage with the australian government and in accordance with australian law and relevant international conventions we will take all possible measures to protect our legal rights and interests xe
zte spokeswoman declined to comment
we have been informed by the govt that huawei amp zte have been banned from providing technology to australia this is extremely disappointing result for consumers huawei is world leader in has safely amp securely delivered wireless technology in aust for close to yrs
huawei one of the world xe largest makers of telecom gear and smartphones already sells equipment to major australian telecom carriers the company wrote to australian lawmakers recently arguing that concerns that its gear could be used by the chinese government for spying were xe cill informed and not based on facts xe
but in statement on thursday two australian ministers indicated that the government would move to exclude certain equipment vendors from the nation xe networks companies that xe care likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from foreign government xe pose unacceptable security risks the ministers said
one of those ministers scott morrison is challenging australia xe prime minister malcolm turnbull for leadership of the country
neither huawei nor zte was specifically named in the australian statement but the two companies xe ties to beijing have long been cited by united states officials to justify keeping them out of american mobile networks
huawei has said repeatedly that it is private company owned by its employees and that it obeys the law wherever it operates still large american wireless carriers have for years shunned both its and zte xe equipment
with such concerns about chinese technology continuing to spread globally it seems increasingly unlikely that the tech cold war between china and the united states will be reconciled quickly
more and more the two economic powerhouses view the race to develop key technologies wireless included in strategic as well as commercial terms both have stood up for their own national tech champions and they have each sought to kneecap the other xe
zte was nearly driven out of business this year after the united states department of commerce barred american firms from selling components to the company the sanctions imposed as punishment for illegal sales made by zte in iran and north korea were later lifted to help defuse tensions between president trump and china xe leader xi jinping
even chinese firms xe research partnerships with universities in the united states and canada have come under scrutiny in june group of washington lawmakers wrote to betsy devos the education secretary calling for review of american universities xe collaborations with huawei
in response huawei xe deputy chairman eric xu hit out at the politicians saying that xe ctheir minds are still in the agrarian age xe
mr xu added xe ctheir behavior shows not just an ignorance of how science and innovation works today but also their own lack of confidence xe

san francisco xe uber which has had reputation for aggressive pursuit of market share even at the expense of profitability reported rare quarterly profit on wednesday that was driven by taking the opposite approach waving the white flag in challenging overseas markets
in march uber agreed to sell its ride and food delivery businesses in southeast asia to grab rival based in singapore uber received percent stake in grab in exchange for withdrawing from the market and last year it agreed to combine its ride sharing operations in russia and other eastern european countries for minority stake in joint venture owned by yandex russian internet giant
both deals closed during the first three months of swinging the money losing company into profitability take away those transactions and uber xe business is still burning cash xe albeit at slower pace than in previous quarters
uber said it made billion in the first three months of on revenue of billion that is an improvement over the previous quarter when the company recorded loss of billion on revenue of billion stripping out one time gains and charges uber reported loss of million
on wednesday uber also said it was retrenching in another huge area of investment its self driving car operations the company said it was shutting down operations in arizona laying off about employees in the area the decision comes two months after one of uber xe driverless cars struck and killed woman in tempe ariz while in autonomous mode
after the crash uber sidelined all of its self driving cars pending the results of an investigation from the national transportation safety board week later the arizona governor doug ducey who had initially welcomed uber xe autonomous vehicle project with open arms ordered the company to suspend testing in the state
uber said it was winding down its driverless car operations in arizona because it wanted to focus its testing efforts near its autonomous vehicle engineering hubs in pittsburgh and san francisco uber said it hopes to resume testing its self driving cars on streets in pittsburgh this summer after the federal investigation concludes
xe cwe xe re committed to self driving technology and we look forward to returning to public roads in the near future xe said sarah abboud an uber spokeswoman
in statement william peduto pittsburgh xe mayor said he learned of uber xe plan to start testing again in the city through social media and that the company had not informed him its plans xe cthis is not the way to rebuild constructive working relationship with local government especially when facing public safety matter xe he said
but ms abboud uber xe spokeswoman said the company has been engaged in ongoing discussion with the mayor xe office and the state about restarting testing
this was not the first quarterly profit at the company it also recorded profit in the third quarter of when it completed another retreat from tough overseas market selling its china operations to rival didi chuxing uber received percent stake in the combined entity
as private company uber is not obligated to report quarterly results it provides fairly detailed earnings statement but its results are not audited and excludes some useful data like user growth and breakdown of its ride hailing business versus food delivery
dara khosrowshahi the chief executive of uber said in statement that the performance of its ride hailing service exceeded its internal xe and undisclosed xe projections he said it planned to continue investing in other areas this year an indication to investors that they should not expect regular profitability from the company in the near future
mr khosrowshahi has pledged to take uber public within the next year raising the pressure on the company to prove that it can turn those losses into profits
although an is coming the company also said on wednesday it was selling existing uber shares to trio of investors in process called tender offer uber said the investment funds coatue altimeter and tpg will buy up to million worth of stock in uber valuing the company at around billion that is more than the billion valuation softbank group and consortium of investors placed on the company in tender offer earlier this year
the latest offering will again allow some of uber xe earliest investors and employees to sell shares

chatbots and other computers are learning but we still have skills they don xe
by thomas friedman
opinion columnist
bangalore india xe fifteen years ago came to bangalore india xe silicon valley to do documentary on outsourcing one of our first stops was company called whose main business was answering customer service calls and selling products like credit cards for companies half world away
the beating heart of back then was vast floor of young phone operators most with only high school degrees save for small pool of techies who provided xe chelp desk xe advice these young indians spoke in the best american english perfected in class that we filmed where everyone had to practice enunciating xe cpeter piper picked peck of pickled peppers xe xe and make it sound like they were from kansas not kolkata
the operations floor was so noisy from hundreds of simultaneous phone conversations that installed white noise machine to muffle the din but even then you could still occasionally hear piercing through the cacophony some techie saying to someone in america the likes of xe cwhat ma xe am your computer is on fire xe
well xe founders xe kannan and shanmugam nagarajan xe invited me back last week for an update their company is now called ai and their shop floor is so quiet that the operators are encouraged to play their own music the only noise is from the tapping on keyboards because every query xe from customers of retailers banks and media companies xe is coming in by text messaging from smartphones tablets desktops and laptops
these text queries are usually answered first by ai chatbot or xe cvirtual agent xe powered by artificial intelligence and only get handed over to person using human intelligence if the chatbot gets stuck and can xe answer the transformation of ai from perfecting its accents to perfecting its insights illustrates in miniature how is transforming the whole work landscape
in nutshell the and indian middle classes were built on something called the high wage middle skilled job in an driven world such jobs are becoming extinct now there are mostly high skilled high wage jobs and low skilled low wage jobs and dwindling number in between
virtually all of the ai human operators today have college degrees because they need to be able to text with good grammar in english understand the interaction between the chatbot and the person calling for service and communicate with expertise and empathy when the chatbot runs out of answers
at the training class sat in on last week peter piper was gone he was replaced by competition among trainees over who could grasp first exactly when the chatbot xe which ai calls by the woman xe name aiva for artificially intelligent virtual assistant xe could no longer understand the xe cintent xe of the customer and what that intent actually was
it xe at that critical point that the human agent not only has to step in and answer the question that aiva couldn xe but also to xe ctag xe the customer xe queries that stumped the bot and feed them to ai xe data scientists who then turn them into new deeper layer of artificial intelligence that enables aiva to answer this more complex query the next time kannan is about to publish book on called xe cthe age of intent xe
the data scientists who figure out the upgrades for chatbots that handle text are called xe cdigital conversation designers xe for another small part of the business data scientists for chatbots that speak in computer generated natural language are called xe cvoice conversation designers xe
xe cit xe cool job xe santhosh kumar year old conversation designer who came up through the system said to me xe cyou are designing what the chatbot should be saying to the customers xe it is all about xe chow to make computer sound like human xe banks want their bots to be formal retailers prefer more conversational bots
another new term learned here was xe ccontainment xe that measures how deep into conversation your chatbot can go without having to hand the customer over to human agent company xe xe ccontainment rate xe is like its batting average
today ai xe containment rate ranges from percent to percent of queries depending on the company it is serving its goal is percent as the bots grasp more of each customer xe intent the skilled humans are redeployed to more complex services and sales and that said kannan xe cturns into better sales and keeping customer satisfaction high xe
his chatbots kannan explained are built with xe cnegative sentiment detector xe to identify angry customers so xe cwe auto generate sympathy when we can xe but for the most part xe ccomplexity and empathy xe are left to the humans
hollywood and bollywood movies lately xe chave created really bad impression that robots are going to take over xe said irene clara trainer xe ci don xe think that fear is justified think we grow together when you xe re teaching aiva you xe re getting skilled yourself and without that aiva becomes incompetent xe
so xe for now xe if you have critical thinking and empathy skills aiva is your friend but wonder what happened to all those indian high school grads met years ago because if you don xe have those skills xe and just have high school degree or less which applies to hundreds of millions of indians xe or you are doing routine tasks that will be easily roboticized well aiva the robotic fruit picker aiva the file clerk or aiva the trucker will not be your friend
so what will country like india with so much unskilled labor do about this challenge it xe coming but so is possible savior it xe also called technology and
while technology taketh it also giveth india xe newest high speed mobile network jio in just the past couple years dramatically slashed the price of cellphone connectivity this has taken smartphone diffusion much deeper into indian society than ever before connecting those making only few dollars day to the mobile network and creating vast new tool kit to lift them from poverty
in mumbai for example met with sagar defense engineering founded by nikunj parashar which is using technology spun off from the defense industry to create simple vessel connected to satellites that rag pickers the poorest of the poor here can be quickly trained on to target and collect the pools of waste that float atop so many indian rivers and lakes xe and get paid for it by the ton
also met with leanagri founded by siddharth dialani and sai gole it is using to create simple cellphone based app to make poor indian farmers more successful the app creates xe cdynamic calendar xe that tells each farmer which and how much seed and fertilizer to use the quantity of water to apply and at what time based on changing climate conditions leanagri xe pilot has been serving farmers in three indian states where some have already seen tenfold increases in their incomes the company said
in bangalore visited the ekstep foundation it was started by nandan nilekani co founder of infosys his wife rohini and the social entrepreneur shankar maruwada ekstep xe cone step xe in hindi argued that if india xe current youth bubble gets left behind by globalization and technology india xe future will be tied to giant ball and chain for the rest of the century
ekstep has created free open source digital infrastructure called sunbird for making personal learning platforms the indian government leveraged it to create national teachers xe platform diksha which enables different states to put qr codes linked to all kinds of topics in their millions of old paper textbooks
now all that student or teacher or parent has to do is point cellphone at the paper qr code and it opens up universe of interactive content xe lesson plans for teachers and study guides for students and parents xe giving india chance to improve numeracy and literacy at whole new speed and scale
so don xe write the conclusion of this story yet thanks to peter piper just might be able to pick lot more than peck of pickled peppers xe so many more that not only the top of india xe society will rise but also the bottom

no one at the wheel driverless cars and the road of the future by samuel schwartz pp publicaffairs
an appalling statistic appears toward the end of xe cno one at the wheel xe samuel schwartz xe valuable primer on self driving cars in the century since the automobile arrived on the scene million people have been killed by it and four billion injured
schwartz who served as new york city xe traffic commissioner in the was nicknamed xe cgridlock sam xe for his devotion to the conundrum of traffic and for coining the loathsome term he knows everything about how cars and people don xe get along having been on the front lines this book xe written in an earnest conversational style xe is his attempt to grapple with fresh threat that xe appeared after decades of progress
futurists may have promised us flying cars but what we xe re going to get instead are driverless ones and schwartz xe is the first comprehensive analysis of what that will mean on the ground most likely there will be far fewer fatalities with nearly people killed in in the united states alone that xe huge benefit but cars that can drive themselves will bring with them other knotty societal problems
by next year both general motors xe self driving unit cruise and alphabet xe waymo formerly the google car aim to have driverless cars available for ride hailing services in major american cities and that xe just the beginning schwartz figures that autonomous vehicles or will arrive in huge numbers in the decades ahead bringing cheaper mobility options improved safety reduced pollution thanks to the electric motors they will favor but also profound ethical dilemmas xe namely the restaging of the conflict between walking and driving
schwartz is in it for pedestrians and bicyclists for centuries shocking as it might seem now people could walk pretty much wherever they pleased sure they had to dodge the occasional mule cart or arriving stagecoach but for the most part they ruled the crude paths and humble cobblestones from ancient rome to belle xc poque europe
the automobile constrained them jaywalking became crime cars mowed them down schwartz and fellow urban enthusiasts successfully fought to reclaim space for the basic human act of walking and now the have appeared
xe cif history warns us about anything xe schwartz notes xe cit xe that pedestrians and cyclists have to be better organized more vocal and more vigilant if they are going to ensure that will not completely eliminate walking on many streets except in fenced in locations or at different levels from the roadway xe
the advent of smartphone enabled businesses like uber and lyft has accelerated this disruption as schwartz points out the riches are plainly in sight cruise was valued at over billion and one wall street bank thinks waymo could be worth billion these players want to launch autonomous mobility services quickly to gain market share leaving until later the debugging of the ensuing mayhem
will pedestrian deaths go down in an future almost certainly but there are other factors to consider even before the robots take over like congestion pricing which schwartz forcefully supports for both human driven cars and
xe someone who enthusiastically drives cars for living and who without reservation admits that the automobile has brought menace and avoidable carnage right along with the freedom to set out on the open road we should have better thought it through the last time around if we heed gridlock sam and this valuable humane book as we move toward future in which we largely surrender the wheel we can avoid messing up again from his perspective we don xe have choice

technology meant to save us from distraction is making us less attentive
by vatsal thakkar
dr thakkar is psychiatrist
was backing my wife xe car out of our driveway when realized wasn xe watching the backup camera nor was looking out of the rear window was only listening for those xe caudible proximity alerts xe xe the high pitched beeps that my car emits as approach an object while in reverse the problem was that my wife xe car an older model doesn xe offer such beeps
had become so reliant on this technology that had stopped paying attention problem with potentially dangerous consequences
backup cameras mandatory on all new cars as of last year are intended to prevent accidents between and the percentage of new cars sold with backup cameras doubled but the backup fatality rate declined by less than third while backup injuries dropped only percent
perhaps one reason is as report from the national highway traffic safety administration put it xe many drivers are not aware of the limitations xe of the technology the report also found that one in five drivers were just like me xe they had become so reliant on the backup aids that they had experienced collision or near miss while driving other vehicles
the fact that our brains so easily overdelegate this task to technology makes me worry about the tech industry xe aspirations xe the fully autonomous everything could technology designed to save us from our lapses in attention actually make us even less attentive
uber xe march toward self driving car hit major speed bump last year in tempe ariz when one of its self driving volvos struck and killed pedestrian while lot of focus was on how vehicle with cameras and radar sensors could completely miss human being on the road less has been said about the failure of the most intricately programmed system in the vehicle xe the brain of the human in the driver xe seat
an investigation revealed that the driver was watching hulu until the moment of the crash because the human brain is impeccable in its ability to filter out extraneous information this type of behavior should have been predicted during normal driving our brains are in near constant state of vigilance but let someone or something do the driving for us and this vigilance easily fades
something similar seems to have happened with handful of fatalities involving tesla xe autopilot mode it seems that the drivers made little to no effort to intervene
the introduction of safety technology has resulted in unintended accidents in other contexts as well in december patient died at major medical center when nurse searched for an anti anxiety medication in an automated dispensing cabinet by typing only its first two letters she chose the first drug that appeared in the results xe vecuronium instead of versed vecuronium is paralytic drug that is sometimes used in executions when it was administered the patient xe vitals crashed and she died within days
technology seems to have turned against us once again in the deadly crashes of two boeing max aircrafts in october pilots on lion air flight in indonesia seem to have struggled against the plane xe supposedly lifesaving technology investigators suspect that sensors incorrectly interpreted the plane xe ascent as too steep causing the plane xe xe cmaneuvering characteristics augmentation system xe to kick in it brought the plane xe nose down ultimately into the java sea at miles per hour
boeing had begun to develop software fix but it wasn xe ready in time for ethiopian airlines flight which just this month crashed possibly because of the same bug killing all people on board in these cases no one can criticize the pilots for failing to pay attention still the crashes were wake up call especially because pilots weren xe required to be trained on the new technology
though supercomputer will always surpass the human brain in terms of pure speed the brain is beyond complex in its ability to reprioritize salient data inputs from multiple sources if one input becomes less relevant our cognitive systems shift their attention to the next most relevant one which these days is usually our mobile devices
but there xe one feature available on some cars today that can increase driver xe vigilance instead of diminishing it xe the manual transmission
car with stick shift and clutch pedal requires the use of all four limbs making it difficult to use cellphone or eat while driving lapses in attention are therefore rare especially in city driving where driver might shift gears hundred times during trip to the grocery store
xe ve owned stick shift vehicle for the last years bought my first upon graduating from med school xe used bmw years later my best man wrote xe cjust married xe on the back windshield and the next year my wife and drove our newborn son home from the hospital in it
sadly sales of manual transmissions are falling and many automakers including audi are discontinuing the option in the united states it appears that xe ll have to keep my model until if want to teach my kids to drive stick
when bought that first five speed bmw my dad cautioned me about safety thinking that driving stick would be more distracting and less safe he was wrong though research on the safety of manual transmissions is scant one study on the driving performance of teenage boys with revealed that cars with manual transmissions resulted in safer more attentive driving than automatics this suggests that the cure for our attentional voids might be less technology not more

some in china are building future that isn xe quite ready still the exuberance may be good thing as useful products find their place and bad ones disappear
by paul mozur
shanghai xe the mind reading headsets won xe read minds the fire detecting machine has been declared safety hazard the robot waiter can xe be trusted with the soup
china is ready for the future even if the future hasn xe quite arrived
china has become global technological force in just few years it is shaping the future of the internet its technology ambitions helped prompt the trump administration to start trade war hundreds of millions of people in china now use smartphones to shop online pay their bills and invest their money sometimes in ways more advanced than in the united states
that has led many people in china to embrace technology full tilt no matter how questionable robots wait on restaurant diners artificial intelligence marks up schoolwork facial recognition technology helps dole out everything from kentucky fried chicken orders to toilet paper china is in competition with itself for the world record for dancing robots
that embrace of tech for tech xe sake xe and the sometimes dubious results it leads to xe were on display at the global intelligence and world business summit held last month in shanghai which several luminaries in chinese tech and academia were supposed to kick off with their minds
donning black headbands that looked like implements of electroshock therapy the seven men and two women onstage were told to envision themselves pressing button the headbands would transmit their brain activity to the robotic hand sharing the stage which would then push button to officially start the conference
countdown began camera put the robotic hand onto huge screen above the stage the people onstage seemed to concentrate and then nothing happened the hand remained motionless the camera panned away
spokesman for yiou the tech consultant that hosted the event declined to comment except for xf xf
all of this embarrasses some people in the chinese tech scene they warn that the excess exuberance is one sign of venture capital bubble which may be about to burst rather than show china xe newfound tech might they argue spectacles like dancing robots and ineffective mind readers cover up the country xe lack of progress in other areas
those deficiencies were made clear in april when the united states forbade american companies to sell chips software and other technology to zte chinese telecom company zte was found to have violated american sanctions by selling products to iran and north korea the ban brought the company to virtual standstill
chinese people shouldn xe lose touch with reality warned liu yadong chief editor of the state run science and technology daily in recent speech he said that china still lagged the united states in tech and that those who argued otherwise ran the risk of xe ctricking leaders fooling the public and even fooling themselves xe
china isn xe the first country to get ahead of itself in tech japan at the height of its economic powers had robots that prepared sushi more recently silicon valley has gone gaga over more than few pointless products like yo xe the app that said only xe cyo xe xe and juicero the juicer ultimately the exuberance could be good thing for china as useful products find their place and bad ones disappear when the boom matures
and china has come long way what was an agrarian backwater years ago is home to the world xe single largest group of internet users and some of its most valuable internet companies
now it xe pushing ahead into emerging tech in chinese start ups took up nearly half the dollars raised globally for artificial intelligence according to cb insights research firm that follows venture capital by china is expected to account for more than percent of worldwide spending on robotics according to technology research firm idc
many in china see the country xe supremacy over the united states in tech as inevitable and they are eager to get to that day
xe cchinese are much more willing to try something new just because it looks cool xe said andy tian chief executive of beijing based asia innovations group which runs mobile apps xe cit sounds superficial it is superficial but that xe the driver of progress in lot of cases xe
the patrol robotic sheriff could fill that bill it is among several security robots that have shown up at train stations and airports around china in recent months the patrol robotic sheriff xe which looks like the camera lens from the hal computer in xe space odyssey xe mounted on white trash tub xe patrols the high speed rail station in the central chinese city zhengzhou tasked with using facial recognition to find and follow suspicious characters as well as to measure air quality and detect fires
during winter visit to the station the robot was nowhere to be found first it had missed fire officials said it also had tendency to collect so many selfie seeking fans that it became safety hazard spokesman for the train station said it was getting an upgrade and would eventually return
robots in particular have captured the chinese imagination beijing television station this year made robot dominated version of the country xe annual lunar new year television special robots and humans performed tai chi and comedy routines and sang and danced
companies and local officials often have good reason to show off their splashiest and silliest wares china frequently takes top down approach to technology with local governments rushing to follow plans that come down from on high gizmos with bit of futuristic verve are often the best symbols of progress
dancing robots for example became something of fixture of company and government presentations last year xe cthey were everywhere xe said david li co founder of shenzhen open innovation lab government supported platform that supports small hardware start ups in shenzhen he estimated that he had seen dancing robot shows in single week
alibaba the chinese online shopping giant has also gotten into the act though in more sophisticated way at one of its new hema grocery stores in shanghai rolling robots take cooked food out onto sort of runway that connects the kitchen to seating team of waiters standing nearby said human hand was required for soup and steamed dishes lest the robots inadvertently splash someone with hot liquid
an alibaba spokeswoman said in an email that the store was prototype that sought to combine digitization with unique consumer experience xe cthe system has driven significant traffic to the hema store xe she added
robot restaurants have been popping up across china one in shanghai xe xujiahui district robot magic restaurant cultivates space age mini golf ambience diners enter through door on which animated fairies flap their wings inside robot with hearts for eyes charged its batteries in an ersatz cave rimmed by silver stalagmites tipped with glowing white lights on the ceiling fake stars twinkled
waiters said their automated counterparts caused more work than they saved the robots take trays of food out to customers but are unable to lower them to the table real waiters stand back so photos and videos can be taken before shuffling in and serving food the old fashioned way
the robots also break down three times during an hour lunch waiter had to lean robot on its side and take blowtorch to the undercarriage to burn out food and trash caught in its axles when asked whether he was worried that the robots would take his job the waiter laughed
still patrons were impressed
xe ci xe ve just been to america and didn xe see many new things at all xe said xie aijuan retiree in her xe ci don xe think they have anything like robotic restaurants there xe
xe cchina is surpassing america xe agreed her dining companion zhuang jiazheng xe crobots are coming tech is advancing it xe all matter of time xe

as politicians debate how to improve the nation xe expensive xe and some would say broken xe health care system americans are eagerly turning to the latest tech devices in hopes of preventing and detecting medical problems early and avoiding costly trips to the doctor or emergency room
xe ctechnology every day is playing more important role in preventing and even diagnosing illness xe said gary shapiro chief executive of the consumer technology association and author of xe cninja future secrets to success in the new world of innovation xe xe we are just beginning this journey of revolutionizing health care and reducing trips to the doctor xe
among the new inventions are many that use artificial intelligence sensors or so called internet of things iot connectivity do host of groundbreaking tasks from detecting alzheimer xe from the sound of your voice to telling breast cancer patients in real time if their chemotherapy treatment is working
some patients seek out new devices as if their lives depend on it and for some it does
take jeff brue tech guru for hollywood films mr brue was on his honeymoon in mexico in when his spleen ruptured and he was rushed to hospital in the town of zihuatanejo for splenectomy upon returning home to los angeles doctors wrongly gave him diagnosis of angiosarcoma rare form of cancer and began an aggressive chemotherapy regimen to treat it
xe cthey told me had year to live xe mr brue who was then said refusing to blindly accept the prognosis he frantically searched the internet for data on his symptoms xe which included degree temperature xe and rushed the pathology reports to other major hospitals in the united states for additional opinions
month later doctors confirmed an error had been made and said he actually had non hodgkin xe lymphoma which was treatable but by then his immune system and liver had been damaged from the wrong chemotherapy treatments and from seven biopsies he xe now awaiting liver transplant in pittsburgh
mr brue attributes much of the misdiagnosis to outdated imaging tools and poor communication between radiologists and oncologists xe cit xe systemic problem xe he said
so between biopsies and positron emission tomography or pet scans he set out to try and change the system mr brue took his opendrives digital storage system which had made him tech rock star in the film and entertainment industry where he worked on productions like xe cgone girl xe xe chouse of cards xe and xe cdeadpool xe and brought it to the health care sector
his system will allow hospitals to store high resolution and scans and other images on its network without having to compress them most hospital networks compress stored images which can make the images fuzzy and potentially cause doctors to miss information said chad knowles chief executive of opendrives
and it xe fast pet scan that might take four minutes to retrieve from network now takes five seconds mr brue said all of this makes it quick and easy to pull multiple high resolution images xe past and present xe from the network and share them with oncologists and radiologists in different offices he said he xe also adding tools to help with diagnosis
the steadman clinic in vail colo leading orthopedic surgical hospital became the first health facility to bring in the opendrives system and talks are underway with several others according to mr brue
voice analysis technology which can detect mental and physical health conditions like coronary artery disease alzheimer xe and even sleep apnea from the sound of someone xe voice is another promising area of advancement
the technology uses to assess hundreds of metrics xe like pitch tone pauses word choices breathing and how person describes photo xe to detect problems
xe cthe manner in which we speak and the word choices we make can be evaluated to accurately detect growing list of clinical conditions xe said rich ross health care research director at gartner research and advisory firm
sonde health winterlight labs and beyond verbal are among the companies developing this technology
xe cwe look at about different metrics xe said liam kaufman chief executive and co founder of winterlight labs whose firm focuses on detecting cognitive medical conditions xe cwe published number of studies in and that found we could predict alzheimer xe at the time with percent accuracy xe and today we xe re at about percent xe he said
pharmaceutical companies like johnson amp johnson cortexyme and alector are using the winterlight lab xe voice technology for drug trials according to mr kaufman but considerably more research and testing is needed before the technology is available to the masses
an increasing number of researchers are using to help radiologists make more accurate diagnostic decisions especially in the area of breast cancer
about women died from breast cancer in the united states in and women have in chance of developing breast cancer in their lifetime according to the american cancer society early detection is seen as key to survival
regina barzilay professor at and member of xe computer science amp artificial intelligence laboratory and constance lehman chief of breast imaging at the department of radiology at massachusetts general hospital in boston created an system to improve the detection and diagnosis of lesions seen on mammograms
current diagnostic tools make it tough to know definitively whether suspicious lesion is high risk benign or malignant especially if the patient has dense breast tissue said dr barzilay who is breast cancer survivor herself she received the diagnosis and was treated in this can result in false positive results that lead to unnecessary biopsies and surgeries
roughly percent of lesions are benign percent malignant and percent high risk following needle biopsy and percent of those xe chigh risk xe lesions are found to be benign following surgery she said
xe cthis means that every year thousands of women go through painful expensive scar inducing surgeries that weren xe even necessary xe dr barzilay said
her team xe system uses machine learning to detect similarities between patient xe breast and database of images for which the malignant or benign outcome was known
she expects that her early detection technology which is being used at massachusetts general will be tested in to more hospitals by the end of the year
at boston university xe biomedical optical technologies lab or botlab researchers have created wearable probe that can monitor in real time if chemotherapy is working on breast cancer patient patients typically wait weeks or even months to see if treatment is working because scans are too costly to do every day or week and they aren xe particularly good for tracking some treatments among other factors according to darren roblyer assistant professor of biomedical engineering at boston university and the head of botlab
xe cso there are patients who have been treated for three to six months of chemotherapy with absolutely no benefit who are suffering the toxic side effects like hair falling out xe dr roblyer said
this device uses near infrared spectroscopy or nir light technology to measure the tumor xe hemoglobin metabolism water and fat levels in noninvasive way to determine whether the chemo is working if not treatments can be adjusted or stopped
the american cancer society recently teamed up with the global center for medical innovation xe labs to invest in the project to help bring the technology from the lab to the commercial market dr roblyer said he expects to begin testing the device on breast cancer patients at boston medical center in the next few months but commercialization is likely several years away
another promising technology is xe so called xe cx ray vision xe technology yes ray vision xe phenomenon usually exploited by comic book characters or mad scientists in science fiction movies but in this case using wi fi and radio waves to see through walls to monitor patients with movement disorders or those prone to falling dina katabi professor at and member of xe computer science amp artificial intelligence laboratory is testing wireless smart home system called emerald that uses sensors and radio signals to track person xe movements sleep stages heartbeat breathing gait and other metrics xe even through the walls in home xe as long as wi fi is present basically radio signals bounce off the person xe body sending the reflection onto the device xe screen xe in the form of stick figure xe that walks sits stops and moves its limbs just as the person does
the technology is aimed at making it easy to collect health and motion data in nonintrusive way to monitor conditions like parkinson xe multiple sclerosis or even sleep apnea so that doctors can adjust medications as needed it can detect side effects or wrong drug doses through changes in heartbeat breathing or other metrics and monitor falls by older people who live alone
xe ctoday if you have sleep issue and want to know how much deep sleep you xe re getting you go to sleep lab and they put electrodes on your head other sensors on your body and then ask you to sleep like that xe dr katabi said with xe csmart xe wi fi box all of this data would be collected without the need for body sensors
emerald is used by some pharmaceutical companies to measure safety and efficacy during drug trials but it xe not yet available to the general public
although many of these new technologies have shown promising early results it could be years if ever for some of them to reach the public
scientists say it xe been an uphill battle just convincing medical journals to publish studies on or agencies to fund them said dr barzilay the reason many don xe have computer scientists sitting on their boards who understand the technology
xe cthey xe re not really equipped to read machine learning proposals because the vast majority work in other areas like biology or something else xe she said xe ci feel constantly have to fight xe
dr barzilay says the winds are slowly changing though and she believes the technology will ultimately prevail xe cit xe absolutely the future it xe even the present xe she said xe cthe question is how fast do we adopt it xe

cambridge england xe when you step off the train here and walk into the city square outside the railway station you will not see the spires of king xe college chapel or the turrets atop the trinity great court the university of cambridge is still cab ride away but you will see stone and glass office building with rooftop patio this is where amazon designs its flying drones
just down the block inside stone building of its own microsoft is designing some sort of computer chip for artificial intelligence and if you keep walking you will soon reach third building marked with powder blue apple logo where engineers are pushing the boundaries of siri the talking digital assistant included with every iphone
for years journalists city planners and other government officials have called this xe csilicon fen xe envisioning the once sleepy outskirts of cambridge as britain xe answer to silicon valley the name xe nod to the coastal plain or fenlands that surrounds cambridge xe never quite stuck but the concept certainly did so much so that the world xe tech powers have moved in snapping up engineers and researchers particularly in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence
their arrival provides welcome fillip for the british economy that xe expected to be bruised by its departure from the european union apple amazon and google established research and engineering hubs in britain by acquiring companies that emerged from local universities spending millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars
there are more than high tech firms in cambridge employing nearly people many of them commuters from other communities according to cambridge network city business group
just across the street from amazon xe cambridge headquarters arm the computer chip company owned by softbank the japanese tech giant recently moved team of engineers into row of temporary offices and new building is going up just yards away this is where samsung the south korean tech conglomerate will soon open another artificial intelligence lab hiring as many as researchers engineers and other staff
xe cfor anybody who hasn xe been here for years they may say xe is this the same place xe xe said claire ruskin the chief executive of cambridge network as she drove through the city on recent afternoon
but those buildings outside the train station are reminders that britain xe like europe as whole xe does not have its own internet powerhouse corporate power capable of pushing the world in new technical cultural and political directions the closest match was arm and that was acquired by softbank in
in london minute train ride from cambridge you will find deepmind perhaps the world xe leading lab deepmind is at the forefront of technological revolution that many believe will shift economic and societal norms across the globe and it was acquired by google in
xe cwe welcome the big existing companies xe said matthew hancock the british secretary of state who oversees digital policy xe cbut we xe re incredibly determined to ensure that the next generation of companies are built here xe
on recent friday morning chris bishop who oversees microsoft research cambridge looked out his fifth floor office window with its panoramic view of cambridge and pointed to the spires of king xe college chapel rising over the trees in the distance xe calan turing was at king xe xe he said
in with his essay xe ccomputing machinery and intelligence xe turing the british mathematician codebreaker and computing pioneer asked whether machines would ever think on their own mr bishop an researcher who studied at oxford and took professorship at the university of edinburgh before moving to cambridge views his work as another link in long british legacy
mr bishop joined the lab in just after it was founded in those days microsoft was the one tech giant paying big money to lure top academics into this kind of corporate research now as artificial intelligence takes center stage at leading tech companies paying big dollars for academics is common
five years ago microsoft moved its lab to the city block size building near the rail station many of mr bishop xe former students and colleagues now work at other big tech companies
neil lawrence university of sheffield professor who studied with mr bishop at cambridge now works at the new amazon cambridge development center just down the street two prominent researchers who worked under mr bishop at microsoft have since moved to google and deepmind
many of these researchers like number of other top researchers in britain were born outside the country still local policymakers are concerned about local talent moving into foreign companies
xe cwe have some of the top researchers in the world in the xe said dame wendy hall computer science professor at the university of southampton xe chow do we stop the brain drain to the xe or to the companies anyway xe
last year the british government commissioned report on the country xe landscape from dame hall and jerome pesenti the chief executive of benevolentai an artificial intelligence start up based in london within weeks of the report xe release mr pesenti moved to facebook he is now vice president of artificial intelligence in the company xe new york office
xe cit does illustrate the point xe dame hall said xe conce your head is above the parapet in this world you draw interest particularly from the big silicon valley giants xe
the report called for increased financing for universities and in the months following the government responded saying it would fund new ph in artificial intelligence and related fields by and invest total of million in math digital and technical education across britain
in cambridge there are bigger questions about the boundaries between academia and industry even those who have prospered financially from the dynamic aren xe sure where to draw the line
zoubin ghahramani cambridge professor who sold start up to uber and is now the company xe chief scientist while still maintaining his ties with the university worries about brain drain from europe in artificial intelligence he has called for the creation of european research institute to recruit people in the region who may otherwise go work for silicon valley firm
his colleague at cambridge steve young respected speech recognition researcher who has sold companies to microsoft google and apple noted that it was xe calmost impossible xe for the university to compete for staff against tech companies limiting who will teach the next generation of students xe cthat could have some very severe consequences xe he said
his comment came with laugh mr young splits time between the university and apple where an important part of his job is recruitment for the company xe ci don xe recruit from cambridge xe he joked
vishal chatrath was the first employee and the chief business officer at vocaliq cambridge speech technology start up that apple acquired in late and transformed into local siri development center now just two blocks from apple xe cambridge outpost he oversees new start up called prowler which aims to automate business decisions that are typically made by humans
for mr chatrath prowler shows how acquisitions by foreign companies can spur the creation of new start ups second vocaliq employee left and recently founded start up called polyai which is trying to build truly conversational computing systems
xe ca lot of capital is now flowing in cambridge and that capital helps push the next wave of entrepreneurs xe mr chatrath said
for others the question is whether start ups like this will evolve into vibrant companies xe or just disappear into company like apple or google
the big american companies are also attracted by the salaries they can pay here according to the recruitment website hired the average tech salary in london is year versus in silicon valley
xe cit remains one of the huge competitive advantages that you can get the same or better talent for cheaper and less churn xe said matt clifford co founder of entrepreneur first start up incubator in london that recruits students from cambridge and oxford entrepreneur first helped create magic pony yet another company which twitter acquired for million in
but some wonder whether these companies could better serve britain by staying independent
ian hogarth trained as machine learning researcher at cambridge founded the live music app songkick and is now an angel investor in britain he argued that if deepmind had remained an independent it may have grown into the country xe first tech superpower
following similar path were start ups like vocaliq acquired by apple and evi the company that amazon acquired in as part of its effort to build the alexa digital assistant evi was the foundation for amazon xe cambridge operation
many have applauded the enormous economic change these acquisitions are helping to drive in london and cambridge but not everyone is clapping
last year in cambridge new housing development was vandalized with graffiti written in latin xe clocus in domos loci populum xe as the bbc reported this translates to xe clocal homes for local people xe as the tech workers land the big salaries home prices are skyrocketing and the locals are being squeezed out it is yet another example of silicon fen xe looking lot like silicon valley

the future of work robots ai and automation by darrell west pp brookings institution
there is little doubt humanity is on the precipice of massive change in how we work the only question is whether it is future of shared prosperity and leisure or one of mass unemployment and turmoil
xe cthe future of work xe offers quick introduction to the basic concepts that underlie the debate we find here all the current buzzwords from xe cmachine learning xe to xe cthe internet of things xe to xe cprecision medicine xe
however it never scratches far beneath the surface or tries to answer the many questions it raises that makes xe cthe future of work xe quick read but ultimately leaves the reader wanting like computer with too little data to draw any conclusions
the second section of the book for example addresses the need for enormous societal change including shift to lifetime learning need for new social contract and new definitions of work these are laudable goals but how do we achieve them
the notion of universal basic income in which everyone receives enough money to live gets mentioned and defined but the huge cost and attendant challenges are barely addressed
perhaps the most interesting observations in the book relate to the rise of donald trump xe ctrump himself may be transitional political leader but the cleavages he identified are real and enduring xe west writes noting that political and economic turmoil are likely only to grow
the biggest challenges shaping the future of work west writes will demand greater political will at time when it xe hard to imagine any politician enacting legislation that might demand long term thinking or lead to shared sacrifice among his recommendations are abolishing the electoral college and implementing significant campaign finance reform xe but we might have to wait until the robots actually take over for either of those things to come to pass
the fourth age smart robots conscious computers and the future of humanity by byron reese pp atria
xe cthe fourth age xe not only discusses what the rise of will mean for us it also forces readers to challenge their preconceptions and it manages to do all this in way that is both entertaining and engaging
reese whose day job is chief executive of the technology research company gigaom begins by grounding the reader in what he sees as the three major changes in human civilization the first characterized by the discovery of fire and language led humans to greatly increase their brain size paving the way for future advancement the second was the development of agriculture which led to the birth of cities and finally writing and the wheel have shaped much of everything until the present
robots and meanwhile promise fourth age characterized by new challenges including what the place of humans will be in world filled with devices that are stronger and potentially smarter than us
reese makes the possibility of impending doom quite palpable with an array of anecdotes it xe not light read in large part because the issues reese is grappling with are complicated and filled with ethical problems the likes of which humans have never confronted
will robots and take all the jobs or will just as many new ones be created will all of society benefit or only those who own the robots assuming we could should we build computers that are as broadly intelligent as humans and if we do to what ends can computers become conscious and if computer does become conscious does it deserve rights
you don xe have to have all the answers xe even the experts don xe agree but xe cthe fourth age xe successfully forces us to face just how thorny those questions are
prediction machines the simple economics of artificial intelligence by ajay agrawal joshua gans and avi goldfarb pp harvard business review
compared with the amount of ink spilled over the prospects of artificial general intelligence and all its accompanying fears xe the singularity xe there xe been much less attention to the smaller changes already happening in the realm of and their quite profound economic implications
enter xe cprediction machines xe which looks at just how far xe cnarrow xe has come over the past few years computers are already good at performing single task for which they have been trained making them more efficient and cost effective than humans in many cases
of course decision making involves more than just being able to make accurate predictions but is also being drafted for higher level functions including using predictions to weigh outcomes and pass judgment
for all their gains though computers are significantly better under certain conditions xe say when they have lot of past data xe and decidedly weaker in others like predicting xe cunknown unknowns xe xe cprediction machines xe does good job of showing where computers work best and where humans still have an edge
the authors argue though that we shouldn xe see this as an either or fight to the death in many cases the best answer is to combine the powerful pattern recognition of computer with the insight of trained human
take one example they offer from the field of medicine well trained algorithm was able to find certain type of breast cancer with percent accuracy human pathologists were able to do so at percent stop there and you would say that computers are getting quite good but not quite as good as highly skilled humans at least at this task
but one need not stop there and thankfully the researchers didn xe combining the work of computers and humans resulted in percent accuracy in part that xe because humans and computers made different kinds of mistakes it xe certainly happier outcome to imagine that we and the machines could work together

san francisco xe alphabet google xe parent company is spending like it is beginning to prepare for life after advertising
currently alphabet makes nearly percent of its money from selling advertising on the internet and gobbles up heaps of data about its users to help marketers target those ads more effectively
but close reading of alphabet xe financial results for the first quarter of which were announced on monday showed that the silicon valley giant is accelerating its efforts to diversify into other businesses
alphabet has made investments in areas like self driving cars and online computer services for businesses for years but spending in those areas was up dramatically in the first quarter the company xe capital expenditures which included installing undersea cables and the construction of new data centers were billion xe more than triple the same period last year
ruth porat alphabet xe chief financial officer said that increase reflected xe ccommitment to growth xe because the company had spent heavily on computing infrastructure for both its own internal use and customer needs like google cloud xe the unit that provides technology services to other companies
alphabet xe expenses rose percent in the quarter ms porat said the heaviest spending came from research and development costs xe mainly the hiring of additional technical staff the company said its total employees had increased to from in the same period year ago
over all alphabet said its net income rose percent to billion from the same period year earlier boosted in part by an increase in the value of its outside investments revenue rose percent to billion
ms porat also pointed out an increase in spending for advertising to promote newer products including google xe own hardware xe relatively new business manufacturing branded smartphones laptops and smart speakers xe and the company xe artificially intelligent digital assistant
xe cthey are thinking about their future xe said collin colburn an analyst at forrester research who focuses on search advertising xe cthey want to diversify beyond just advertising being such big part of their business xe
that focus on variety comes as the data collection practices that underpin the entire digital advertising industry are under intense scrutiny after the personal information of up to million facebook users ended up in the hands of the political research firm cambridge analytica google xe advertising business is more than twice the size of facebook xe and the company xe portfolio of data about its users is as expansive xe if not more so xe than that of the social network
still the search giant xe core business showed no sign of slowing in the first quarter revenue from google xe advertising business which includes ads shown on google search and commercials running before youtube videos increased percent during the quarter
however google xe advertising profits were weighed down by an increase in traffic acquisition costs xe the fees that it pays companies like apple to make sure that its search engine is the default option when people open browser on the iphone
also among the company xe expenditures in the quarter billion to buy the chelsea market building in manhattan where the company had set up some of its new york offices
on conference call with investment analysts sundar pichai google xe chief executive avoided answering questions about the potential effects of new regulations concerning data privacy in europe the new law which goes into effect on may will restrict how companies like google can collect store and use personal data from users across europe
mr pichai said the company has been preparing for the law for more than months but didn xe discuss how the new regulations may affect the company xe bottom line

san francisco xe don xe look now storm clouds are gathering over tech
chinese consumers have pulled back their spending blowing billion hole in apple xe recent quarterly revenue china was again culprit when nvidia warned last month that its revenue would come in percent below expectations though the graphics chip maker also blamed slack demand from bitcoin miners and cloud data centers
intel the big chip maker cited intensifying xe ctrade and macro concerns xe for financial results in january that did not meet expectations and samsung another semiconductor powerhouse said sales plunged percent in the fourth quarter because of weakening demand for its memory chips from data centers and smartphones
china smartphones bitcoin and cloud computing have been among the major drivers of the long tech boom which in turn has powered the global economy for the last decade the ingredient common to all of these sectors is computer chips which form the brains of devices and whose ubiquity means they provide early signals about changes in supply and demand
warnings about sales slowdown this year have come in recent weeks from big chip suppliers that also include taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company micron technology and western digital it xe an abrupt reversal coming on the heels of stellar results in for the business that gave silicon valley its name
last year manufacturers shipped staggering trillion chips and other semiconductor devices percent more than the year before ic insights estimates but is shaping up to be much different story now that several important sources of chip demand appear to be dampening
the notion that chip dip could lead to general downturn evokes memories of when one day tech had an unlimited future and the next it was crashing in what became known as the dot com bust
back then investors showed no mercy intel made what seemed modest adjustment to its revenue forecast for the third quarter of saying it would be up to percent instead of to percent the value of the company immediately fell by nearly percent over the next few days
this year with similar downgrade investors largely shrugged it off intel shed about percent of its value over week
while acknowledging the parallels to gene munster research director for loup ventures venture capital firm said xe ci think it xe different this time xe
back then among the best customers for the established chip firms were start ups which had more dreams than revenue as the start ups faltered the chip firms were imperiled the storm lasted for years
xe cthese are all real companies now with real customers xe mr munster said xe cpeople are willing to look past few bumpy months xe
even if the problems do not linger they are reminder that demand is not eternal that seems to be what happened with smartphones which use multiple varieties of chips to run software process data and connect to cellular networks
consider apple which gave muted forecast in october for the holiday season and followed up early last month with its first full fledged revenue warning in years the iphone maker faces stiff competition and slumping demand in china total smartphone shipments fell percent in that country in the fourth quarter according to research firm canalys
michael wolf who surveys consumers annually about their technology and media usage for his management consulting firm activate said people seem to be shifting to lower priced phone models and cheaper service plans but he said demand seems strong for digital subscription services like netflix video games online advertising and business to business sales for companies like microsoft
xe cfrom all of our research don xe see some general consumer malaise xe mr wolf said
yet several other businesses appear to be softening as well including the market for server systems used by cloud service operators including amazon microsoft and google sales of high priced chips for such hardware have driven profits for companies like intel and nvidia but they now say that equipment buyers for data centers have turned cautious
xe ccloud service providers shifted from building capacity to absorbing capacity xe robert swan who was then intel xe chief financial officer and acting chief executive said on conference call after intel released its fourth quarter results on thursday mr swan became intel xe chief executive
longtime tech industry watchers began picking up trouble signs late last spring in the market for memory chips an essential component in computers that in decades past prompted trade tensions between the united states and rivals in japan and south korea makers of key category called dynamic random access memory or dram have suffered product shortages and gluts that whipsawed pricing and heralded changing fortunes for the broader industry
during the dot com bust of dram revenue plummeted percent while total semiconductor revenue fell percent according to gartner data
but conditions changed dramatically over the years as manufacturers fled from the lack of profits leaving three major dram makers xe samsung hynix and micron they have been slow to boost production enabling them to keep their prices high and they also benefited as memory became more important in smartphones data center hardware and other products beyond the personal computers that once drove most sales
xe cthe markets today are structurally different xe sanjay mehrotra micron xe chief executive said in recent interview
yet market cycles haven xe disappeared entirely dram prices peaked last june and began sliding prompting micron and samsung to issue their recent profit warnings dramexchange taiwan based firm that tracks the market predicts dram prices will fall an additional percent in the first quarter
memory chips xe cbehave like onions or steel or any other commodity xe said jim handy market researcher at objective analysis xe cif there is an oversupply prices fall xe
nvidia presents an extreme example of both boom and bust the year old company which pioneered the specialized processors that generate images in video games became one of silicon valley xe most valuable companies in as those chips were adapted for artificial intelligence uses by internet giants
but nvidia xe processors also became extremely popular for the mathematical process of mining digital currency driving surge in demand that inflated prices and created shortage of chips buyers wound up placing multiple or overly ambitious orders making it hard for the company to get handle on conventional demand for its technology
the cryptocurrency bubble faded suddenly last year causing nvidia xe revenue and stock price to tumble as the company wound up with extra inventories of unsold chips the crypto issue xe cended up being way way bigger xe for the company than expected said hans mosesmann an analyst at rosenblatt securities xe cit xe been crazy story xe
for all the turmoil industry executives and analysts said that business conditions remain lot healthier than past semiconductor slumps for one thing series of mergers has reduced price competition companies like micron which routinely lost money in past cycles are expected to remain solidly profitable even if sales dip
beyond that there is the glorious future
xe ceventually the storm will pass and these companies xe nvidia apple samsung xe will have pole position in the next tech growth curve including health care self driving cars xe said mr munster the loup analyst xe cthe curve is so exciting so juicy so full of opportunity xe

they are leaving many xe casualties of history xe in their wake
by thomas edsall
mr edsall contributes weekly column from washington on politics demographics and inequality
the growing use of work robots and the deployment of artificial intelligence have been most disruptive in just those areas of the country that provided president trump with crucial margins of support in
in paper that was published earlier this year xe robots and jobs evidence from labor markets xe daron acemoglu and pascual restrepo economists at and boston university demonstrate that the midwest and sections of the south have far higher ratios of robots to population than other regions of the united states
they calculate the job losses resulting from the addition of one robot in xe commuting zone xe their bottom line xe cone more robot in commuting zone reduces employment by about six workers xe
these job losses are concentrated
in blue collar occupations such as machinists assemblers material handlers and welders workers in these occupations engage in tasks that are being automated by industrial robots so it is natural for them to experience the bulk of the displacement effect created by this technology
the adverse effects of automation fall disproportionately on the voters who cast most of their ballots for trump in white men much more than women and whites without college degrees
donald trump xe trillion tax cut has increased incentives to replace workers with robots contradicting his campaign promise to restore well paying manufacturing jobs in the nation xe heartland
the trump tax bill permits xe cu corporations to expense their capital investment through so if corporation buys robot for thousand it can deduct the thousand immediately to calculate its taxable income rather than recover the thousand over the life of the robot as under prior law xe steven rosenthal senior fellow at the urban institute and specialist in tax policy wrote me by email
have addressed the impact of robotics on trump voters in previous columns but today want to explore these developments in greater detail as tools to gather and analyze information have improved
one of the most striking developments in recent decades is the ongoing decline in work force participation among men from percent in july to percent in september according to the federal reserve
this drop in participation has been sharpest for men without college degrees
in an email david autor who is also an economist at explained the situation
we find that automation displaces employment and reduces labor xe share of value added in the industries in which it originates in the case of employment these own industry losses are reversed by indirect gains in customer industries and induced increases in aggregate demand
overall according to autor
employment is growing steadily and its growth in terms of number of jobs has not been discernibly dented by technological progress but the sum of wage payments to workers is growing more slowly than economic value added so labor xe share of the pie of net earnings is falling this doesn xe mean that wages are falling it means that they are not growing in lock step with value added
automation and productivity improvements autor wrote
tend to grow the economic pie in aggregate while simultaneously considerably diminishing some slices and yet expanding others xe dramatically most new workplace technologies displace some worker tasks and entire jobs devalue certain skills and disrupt livelihoods this is individually and socially costly and politically disruptive
thompson author of the classic work of british history xe the making of the english working class xe described the brutality of economic transformation during the industrial revolution in britain
the experience of immiseration came upon them in hundred different forms for the field laborer the loss of his common rights and the vestiges of village democracy for the artisan the loss of his craftsman xe status for the weaver the loss of livelihood and of independence for the child the loss of work and play in the home for many groups of workers whose real earnings improved the loss of security leisure and the deterioration of the urban environment
while there are parallels between conditions of workers during industrialization in england and during the deindustrialization of regions of this country now one big difference stands out from political vantage point in england workers turned sharply to the left while here they have moved sharply to the right
autor identified contemporary source of discontent he noted that even if automation creates xe can opportunity for every citizen to gain in theory xe that
will almost never happen without forceful social policy and tax policy that spreads the gains and buffers the individual losses absent those policies which the has little of in general and even less so today than in earlier decades losses will tend to be highly concentrated among displaced workers and in communities in which legacy employers are located
the major concern for the labor market in the united states autor wrote
is not the number of jobs per se but the decline in labor xe share of value added and even more urgently the steep falls in earnings among less educated workers which certainly have technological origin
acemoglu and restrepo worry that the robot related dislocations in automated industries will harm and thus inflame the discontent of key voters even as jobs are created elsewhere in their january paper xe artificial intelligence automation and work xe they write
last but not least the development and adoption of productivity enhancing ai technologies cannot be taken for granted if we do not find way of creating shared prosperity from the productivity gains generated by ai there is danger that the political reaction to these new technologies may slow down or even completely stop their adoption and development this underscores the importance of studying the distributional implications of ai the political economy reactions to it and the design of new and improved institutions for creating more broadly shared gains from these new technologies
acemoglu and restrepo agree with autor that
greater use of robots in commuting zone is likely to generate benefits for the rest of the economy by reducing the prices of tradable goods now produced using robots and by creating shared capital gains
but acemoglu and restrepo contend that even after calculating xe cthese positive spillovers across commuting zones xe there are still xe cuniformly negative aggregate effects xe
their calculations suggest that
one more robot per thousand workers reduces aggregate employment to population ratio by about percentage points or equivalently one new robot reduces employment by about workers and wages by about percent as opposed to percentage points and percent respectively without trade
asked acemoglu whether these findings challenge the economic argument that technological advance is almost always beneficial he replied
it does challenge the conventional wisdom to some degree but this conventional wisdom is really up for challenge the view that technological change always and everywhere benefits most groups is completely devoid of historical context this isn xe what has happened in history this isn xe what has happened in the early th century
he cited key developments in the late and early
during mechanization of agriculture we have also experienced rapid creation of new jobs and tasks in industry both for production workers and for clerical workers if it weren xe for these other changes many of them technological and social in nature mechanization of agriculture would have created much more hardship and today we tend to forget how much hardship it did create in the first place
acemoglu restrepo and autor are not alone in exploring the economic and political consequences of robotics and artificial intelligence
jeffrey sachs professor of economics at columbia has parallel take writing by email
until now automation robotics machines more generally smart systems has mostly replaced activities that require brawn agriculture mining lifting warehousing repetitive physical activity assembly line cutting sowing basic data management ledgers various logistics while being complementary with complex management human judgment highly contextual activities
the demographic group most hindered by the rise of automation sachs wrote xe chas been the proverbial white male with less than college degree and living in rural and semirural areas xe
sachs believes that
the next wave of job losses will be in basic business services wholesale and retail trade warehousing and transport which will mean another hit for workers with relatively lower educational attainment
in terms of incomes according to sachs xe cautomation including ai will raise overall output but lower the earnings of some or even all workers while raising the returns to many forms of capital xe
without the adoption of redistributive tax and spending policies he argued
the old the skilled and the rich who will make intergenerational transfers within families to their own children will benefit at the expense of the young the less skilled and the poor all of this seems to be underway
jason furman professor of economics at harvard xe kennedy school who served as chairman of the council of economic advisers in the obama administration writing with robert seamans professor of management at has broader view of the positive and negative effects of automation and artificial intelligence
in their june paper xe and the economy xe furman and seamans argue that from theoretical perspective innovation has four effects on labor markets
the first is that xe cautomation can directly displace labor in the affected sector xe second is that xe cautomation can create new jobs in new areas xe the authors note that xe cjob losses at brick and mortar department stores were more than made up for by new opportunities at fulfillment and call centers xe the third effect is that xe chigher incomes increase demand for jobs throughout the economy including in ways that are not directly linked to technology for example the share of workers in leisure and hospitality in the united states has steadily trended upward as household incomes have risen enabling people to afford more restaurants and travel xe and the fourth effect is that xe ctechnology may replace specific tasks rather than entire jobs xe leaving substantial room for human employment in jobs that will be changed by worker xe having new tool at their disposal xe
both the upside and the downside of artificial intelligence furman and seamans point out have xe cthe potential to dramatically change the economy xe adding that
on the one hand the potential for increased productivity growth is welcome given the decades long slowing in productivity growth in the united states and other advanced economies on the other hand the potential for ai induced labor disruptions could potentially exacerbate existing problems in the labor force including the decades long decline in male labor force participation rate
the trump tax cut not only boosted incentives for corporations to replace workers with robots it has also created incentives for american companies to move production overseas even as it directed resources toward xe opportunity zones xe in what the trump administration defines as xe cneglected and underserved communities xe xe incidentally providing bounty of lucrative grants guarantees and breaks for real estate developers
while trump is clearly attuned to the political power of white working class anger xe in he ignited blue collar insurgency and mobilized white men in particular xe his campaign rhetoric is also expedient he is highly attuned to the agenda of the republican party he leads not to mention the corporate establishment and its antipathy to corporate taxation and it goes without saying that the tax cut was enormously beneficial to trump and to his family xe by conservative estimates he will personally save from to million annually and his estate will reap millions
the reality for the voters who believed in trump is not so bright take two counties alger and ontonagon both on michigan xe upper peninsula which voted overwhelmingly for trump in and two years later their respective unemployment rates are and percent compared with the low national rate of percent these two counties have median household incomes of and far below the national median which is
on monday the daily mining gazette in next door houghton county mich reported that the xe copioid crisis has hit the ontonagon county region hard xe with xe cone of the highest opioid related hospitalization rates in michigan xe
andrew shotwell local attorney told the county board that opioid use is increasing and that xe contonagon in the top for that in the state of michigan xe the gazette reported that prescriptions xe crose from per people in the county in to in more than the number of people xe
thompson looking at th century england put the plight of similarly technologically displaced people best
their crafts and traditions may have been dying their hostility to the new industrialism may have been backward looking their communitarian ideals may have been fantasies their insurrectionary conspiracies may have been foolhardy but they lived through these times of acute social disturbance and we did not their aspirations were valid in terms of their own experience
ontonagon county is at an extreme but at the extreme it illuminates the bleak dislocation much of trump country has suffered
from to the county population plummeted from to young people are leaving in droves percent of the population is or older more than twice the national average which is percent percent of county residents are under compared with percent nationally
per capita retail sales measure of economic vitality were last year in the county according to the census compared with nationally
these are men and women to quote thompson again who xe clived through these times of acute social disturbance xe if thompson continued xe cthey were casualties of history they remain condemned in their own lives as casualties xe
erik brynjolfsson and andrew mcafee professors at with specialization in the economics of automation are conducting research project on xe cdigital technologies and their impact on the earnings prospects of american workers xe they report that some of the news
is clearly bad the median american household earns less than it did fifteen years ago labor xe share of national income peaked in the early and has been falling pretty steadily since then long term unemployment has emerged as vexing problem and start ups are creating many fewer jobs than they used to
carl benedikt frey and michael osborne of the oxford martin program on the impacts of future technology in britain have estimated that about percent of total employment in the united states is susceptible to computerization they note that xe cwages and educational attainment exhibit strong negative relationship with an occupation xe probability of computerization xe in addition frey and osborne write that
high skilled workers have moved down the occupational ladder taking on jobs traditionally performed by low skilled workers pushing low skilled workers even further down the occupational ladder and to some extent even out of the labor force
in separate study frey and thor berger also of the oxford martin school have found that xe cthe bulk of low skilled and low income workers are now for the first time susceptible to computerization xe adding that xe cworkers with extraordinary social and creative skills will still remain in the work force in xe
trump is convinced that he has extraordinary skills boasting last month xe ci have gut and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else xe brain can ever tell me xe at moment like this do voters want to be governed by president who as his first secretary of state publicly pointed out is xe cundisciplined xe and xe cdoesn xe like to read xe xe and that was after calling him xe cmoron xe behind closed doors
would argue that we have been warned xe the situation that obtains in the country today has to be grasped with the head as much as with the gut

arizona prosecutors said tuesday that they had not found evidence to charge uber with crime in connection with an accident in which one of its autonomous cars hit and killed pedestrian in tempe year ago
on march volvo sport utility vehicle one of several self driving vehicles that uber was testing was traveling about miles per hour when it hit elaine herzberg as she was walking her bicycle across the street at night the authorities said
while the car was in autonomous mode safety driver was sitting in the driver xe seat
the yavapai county attorney xe office which reviewed the case said in letter dated monday that there was xe cno basis for criminal liability for the uber corporation xe
but it added that investigators should look into what the safety driver xe cwould or should have seen that night given the vehicle xe speed lighting conditions and other relevant factors xe
the yavapai county attorney xe office said an investigation into the case was continuing
in june the tempe police department released report that said the safety driver was streaming the television show xe cthe voice xe on her phone in the minutes leading up to the crash the arizona republic reported
uber declined to comment tuesday as did the tempe police the yavapai county attorney xe office did not answer further questions about how it reached its decision
the march crash is believed to be the first pedestrian death resulting from self driving technology and many wondered how prosecutors would approach criminal investigation
the crash raised questions about the safety of the technology as well as the comprehensiveness of the rules governing it few such federal or state rules exist
xe cit xe not very well trod at all xe said frank douma research scholar at the university of minnesota xe center for transportation studies xe cto my knowledge there is not any sort of real bright line statement about who xe liable when xe
mr douma said prosecutors xe announcement tuesday tracked with how typically people and not car manufacturers are held responsible for crimes they commit behind the wheel but as autonomous vehicles become more sophisticated he said such cases raise questions about that way of thinking
xe cis this driver or was this driver behaving in any way different than what most drivers are going to be behaving like when the car is doing this much driving xe he said xe cit xe very conventional way of thinking to say we can expect and we should expect people to sit and monitor technology that is otherwise doing all the decision making xe
the yavapai county attorney xe office did its review at the request of the maricopa county attorney xe office which had potential conflict of interest in the case because of an earlier partnership with uber in safety campaign the maricopa county attorney xe office did not respond to requests for comment on tuesday
the new york times reported last march that uber xe autonomous cars in arizona struggled to meet the company xe expectations and required drivers to intervene more frequently than those of the company xe competitors
uber suspended testing of self driving vehicles after the crash in december the vehicles returned to public roads though at reduced speeds and in less challenging environments
in preliminary report about the crash released in may the national transportation safety board said the uber car xe computer system had spotted ms herzberg six seconds before impact but classified ms herzberg who was not in crosswalk first as an unrecognized object then as another vehicle and finally as bicycle
the uber car equipped with uber xe sensing technology comes with an automatic emergency braking system from the manufacturer
but uber had disabled that function as well as other safety features to xe creduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior xe according to the report putting the onus on the safety driver to intervene
the agency said uber xe safety driver grabbed the steering wheel to swerve at the last second but did not start braking until after impact
the republic reported last march that family members of ms herzberg had xe cresolved xe case against uber the republic said that the family was represented by the law firm bellah perez which said tuesday that it could not comment on whether the firm had been involved in the case

san francisco xe basketball players have pickup games rappers have freestyle cyphers tech entrepreneurs according to the former chief executive of uber riff on big ideas in something they call xe cjam sesh xe
travis kalanick the former chief executive of uber who is known for pushing boundaries in business kept his answers short and his demeanor neutral as he testified on tuesday in high profile court fight between waymo and his former employer over intellectual property
waymo the self driving car unit of google xe parent company alphabet called mr kalanick to the stand during the first full day of testimony in the federal trial it hoped to reveal how uber xe win at all costs attitude had pushed the company to acquire otto an autonomous vehicle start up created by former google engineer anthony levandowski
waymo contends xe and uber denies xe that the deal was part of uber xe plan to steal intellectual property from google xe self driving car project which would later be renamed waymo in order to close the gap in an area of technology essential to its business
as he waded through questions from waymo xe lawyers mr kalanick who resigned in june as uber xe chief executive offered unusual insight into how deals get done in silicon valley and the freewheeling xe some might say self parodying xe business culture at the biggest technology start ups
mr kalanick said he and other uber executives had xe cjam sesh xe or jam session with mr levandowski on sunday while mr levandowski was still employed by google in fact mr kalanick was such fan of these sessions that profile of him revealed that his home was called xe cjam pad xe
jam sesh as mr kalanick explained it is business meeting akin to session in which jazz ensemble spontaneously works out music creative people come in with their own ideas and create xe cbeautiful music xe or business plans the group discussed laser sensor technology that was critical to the operation of self driving cars handwritten note on whiteboard read xe claser is the sauce xe
mr kalanick wearing dark gray suit blue shirt and silver tie in court tuesday didn xe deny that uber had wooed mr levandowski and met with him at uber xe offices before he left google he said he was xe ca big fan xe of the engineer one of the first employees at google xe self driving car project and wanted to hire him
but there was hangup mr levandowski wanted to venture out on his own
xe ci wanted to hire anthony and he wanted to start company so tried to come up with situation where he could feel like he started company and could feel like hired him xe mr kalanick said choosing his words carefully between long sips of water he polished off four bottles of water in less than an hour on the witness stand
uber acquired otto for reported million in just six months after it was started it is unclear how much mr levandowski already wealthy man thanks to million bonus from his time at google personally made in the deal an uber spokesman matt kallman said the company had fired mr levandowski in may before otto could meet any of its performance targets as result he lost out on an estimated million worth of equity in uber
waymo contends that the clever solution xe let mr levandowski create his own company and then buy it xe was simply obfuscation for plot to steal important technology from waymo
while the deal was unusual it xe not rare for an executive to want to ensure his independence inside larger company technology giants often have to sell founders of start ups on the idea that they will maintain some independence as well as big payday in an acquisition facebook for example acquired instagram and kept the photo sharing app separate unit within the company
otto is still an independent unit within uber and is technically separate defendant in this case
waymo is trying to portray mr kalanick and mr levandowski as pair of aggressive money hungry conspirators who worked together to steal google xe intellectual property
before mr kalanick testified uber xe lawyers objected to waymo xe presenting text message that mr levandowski sent to mr kalanick with clip from the movie xe cwall street xe in which gordon gekko played by michael douglas passionately argues that xe cgreed for the lack of better word is good xe no ruling was made
on wednesday mr kalanick is expected to be asked how much he revealed to uber xe board about mr levandowski and what the engineer had taken with him from google
in deposition testimony before the trial bill gurley an investor and former board member at uber said the company xe board had not been shown due diligence report before the acquisition of otto
mr gurley who stepped down from uber xe board in june said he wouldn xe have voted in favor of the acquisition had he known the report indicated that mr levandowski possessed files from google
nathan ballard spokesman for mr levandowski said after the session in the federal courthouse in san francisco that xe calthough great many things have been said about anthony over the last two days we are confident that he will eventually be vindicated xe

two years ago the ford motor company boasted about having been named interbrand xe best global green brand and said it was committed to working to meet stricter fuel economy standards last week after lobbying with the rest of the industry to strike down those standards ford announced that it would largely abandon the american passenger car market in favor of building more trucks crossovers and
ford xe announcement marks significant turning point for the american auto industry the only heritage united states carmaker that didn xe go bankrupt in the great recession of it had become one of its greenest but its decade xe worth of investment in developing more fuel efficient cars is now taking back seat to profit
to be sure today xe crossovers and are safer cleaner and more fuel efficient than their predecessors but they xe re still no real match for passenger cars xe sedans hatchbacks and wagons xe when it comes to fuel economy and reduced emissions high riding resist the wind more which decreases economy and hurts handling as does the additional weight of these big tired behemoths
ford received billion loan from the department of energy in to build more fuel efficient vehicles and indeed it developed several internal combustion engines with notably reduced thirst for gasoline within few years it had fine full line of passenger cars the company was well positioned for greener future but something changed
automakers have spent billions in the past decade to improve gas mileage and while ford will add more hybrid and pure electric vehicles to the market it now plans to pack pounds back on xe cby almost percent of the ford portfolio in north america will be trucks utilities and commercial vehicles xe ford announced it plans to keep in production the relatively low volume mustang sporty car that sells for higher prices than ordinary sedans and forthcoming rugged variation on its focus hatchback
so what changed the return of cheap gas for one thing it makes larger less fuel efficient vehicles affordable again to many consumers american carmakers spent the years around their great bailout professing their ardor for new generation of fuel efficient vehicles but in the end they were only too happy to steer people back into which are more profitable
call it the profit paradigm added height elevates the price people are prepared to pay for what is essentially the same vehicle and crossovers sell at higher prices than cars of equivalent size but they cost little if anything more to build
the unwillingness of congress to tax gasoline more heavily did not help nor did the readiness of the obama administration to accommodate so much of detroit xe pro agenda in its regulations though they did raise federal mileage standards the rule makers rewarded companies that built bigger vehicles by setting standards matched to vehicle size with large cars allowed to burn more gas and pollute more and now the trump administration is moving to reduce even those standards
even in times of robust fueled profit carmakers have not seen their share prices rise much especially compared with the tech companies that may in the era of self driving cars become their competitors last october ford proclaimed it would cut its future spending by billion its stock did nothing last week it announced it would trim an additional billion xe cwe xe re going to feed the healthy parts of our business xe ford xe chief executive jim hackett told analysts xe cand deal decisively with the parts that destroy value xe
it xe stunning moment the head of great american car company is calling the great american family sedan value destroyer and walking away from percent of the vehicle buying population and hundreds of thousands of passenger car sales year
what xe more the move effectively cedes the passenger car market in north america to competitors old japanese korean and new chinese
ford xe race to the bottom is consistent with xe recent decision to sell its german opel division virtually quitting europe and with it its most advanced small car development operation fiat chrysler too announced the cancellation of its small and medium size car lines in the united states in
american carmakers have been trying to impress the market with radical short term surgeries whatever the momentary boost to share prices the decision to go all out for poses long term risk ford will be much more susceptible to the ill effects of rising oil prices one severe oil price spike could send consumers back to passenger cars the ones ford is no longer making
high oil prices at least ford understands autonomous cars and ride sharing on the other hand could spell the end of business as ford knows it so while american automakers are preparing or at least thinking of preparing for the world of tomorrow they are also trying to make as much money as they can as fast as they can they don xe know what this future will be and they xe re kind of afraid of it but they sure hope it includes xe

re xe for doctors age may be more than number xe by haider javed warraich sunday review jan
the article troubles me for many reasons mostly for its hubris but also for its conceit dr warraich who is writes xe cin medicine lack of experience may not actually be bad thing xe
as recently retired general and vascular surgeon who was privileged to be part of the training of some surgical residents feel qualified to comment happily admit that the xe ctraining xe went both ways all those years xe like to think the benefits were mostly in favor of the residents after all they learned when why and especially how to operate and most important when not to operate
would you want an inexperienced pilot or pilot in training to fly your next flight there is no doubt that medical students and residents are the lifeblood of the future of medicine but there is no substitute for experience
steven kahn princeton
to the editor
agree with dr haider javed warraich young doctors have many good qualities that have nothing to do with age for better or worse but when he writes that xe cnothing is more reassuring to patients than seeing silver haired doctor walk up to their bedside xe have to disagree
to the contrary seeing silver haired doctor walk up to my bedside could give me plenty of concern about his experience with modern techniques and recent medical research
fiona bayly new york
to the editor
when started medical school was when start my neurology residency in july will be will my age in and of itself make me any more likely to order unnecessary imaging studies or prescribe opioid painkillers than my year old peers of course not
dr haider javed warraich means to suggest rather that those who have been in practice for fewer years are more open minded with more innovative inclinations and that these traits may lead to better outcomes for patients but what will keep the vibrantly unprejudiced young doctors of today from becoming obstinate and old fashioned senior attendings tomorrow
or should we simply insist that physicians stop practicing once they reach crucial tipping point on the longitudinal scale of clinical experience
perhaps instead of correlating improved health outcomes with the life years that the youngest doctors lack we should focus on determining which educational professional experiences closely correspond with novice doctors xe patient care successes and focus on making those accessible to and even required of doctors of every age at every stage of their careers
adina wise philadelphia
to the editor
dr haider javed warraich correctly identifies the worst of old school medical practice arrogant doctors who rely on anecdotal experience as psychiatrist and medical school clinical faculty member for years have learned lot from my students they are dedicated to social justice attentive to language and more aware of policy ethics and social determinants of health
what they struggle with however and what remains an area poorly addressed in their training is the more nuanced interpersonal domain if tradition blinds older doctors ideology can blind younger ones
holding impeccable values does not help them engage authentically with honest insightful emotional awareness needing to understand an individual patient requires more than machine learning big data political correctness or treatment algorithms
psychological depth may be the real new frontier of sound medical care it can also reduce error burnout and patient dissatisfaction

to the editor
after years in orthopedic practice my small community hospital in upstate new york affiliated with medical school and suddenly we were inundated with medical students residents and fellows from my standpoint this was the best thing that had happened to my practice since left my fellowship could no longer just do what had been doing needed to explain it not only to the students but also to myself
the presence of younger colleagues whether trained surgeons or students or doctors in training gave new life and meaning to my practice passing on my knowledge is gift that will keep on giving but learning from them in turn has been enlightening
cannot imagine better way to approach my final years get to bask in the excitement of new learners and to leave mark on the next generation in the last four years have learned not to take anything have done for granted this serves me and more important my patients well
beth dollinger elmira
to the editor
am an year old neurologist and too have been asked my age all the time since started in practice when patients ask how old their doctor is find that it is always question of relevant knowledge skills and attitudes
in medical school and residency doctors learn what can be done and how to do it but not whether when or why to do it nothing is more difficult for me than treating patient who has had stroke or some other adverse event during procedure or an operation that believe should have never been undertaken in the first place
it is the delicate balance between technical skills and judgment that is at issue in choosing doctor and there is no easy answer my own experience suggests that people should rely on well trained primary care physician to guide their care and not self refer to specialists for the great majority of medical problems

new essay explores the possible real life examples for the lorax character and truffula trees
credit credit dr seuss enterprises
supported by
by joanna klein
what inspired the creature who was xe cshortish and oldish and brownish and mossy xe the one who spoke in voice that was xe csharpish and bossy xe he spoke for the trees yet he called them his own all that he left xe cin this mess was small pile of rocks with the one word xe xa xe unless xe xe
in millions of people observed earth day for the first time and the environmental protection agency was born joni mitchell xe xe cbig yellow taxi xe topped the charts
and in la jolla calif theodor geisel also known as dr seuss was fighting to keep suburban development project from clearing the eucalyptus trees around his home but when he tried to write book about conservation for children that wasn xe preachy or boring he got writer xe block
at his wife xe suggestion to clear his mind they traveled to the mount kenya safari club an exclusive resort where guests watched animals along kenya xe laikipia plateau
and if you haven xe guessed by now it was there that xe cthe lorax xe took shape xe on the blank side of laundry list nearly all of its environmental message created in single afternoon
today it has been translated into more than dozen languages sold more than million copies and adapted into film it was dr seuss xe favorite book and one that was much discussed for its environmental resonance
in it the lorax who xe cspeaks for the trees xe pops up from chopped down tree stump and angrily demands that businessman called the once ler stop cutting down truffula trees to knit xe cthneeds xe but the once ler doesn xe listen and eventually is left alone in crumbling empty factory on barren landscape
despite an unsuccessful attempt by the logging industry to ban xe cthe lorax xe in the many have embraced the storybook as critical tale about environmental policy especially for children ultimately heeding hopeful message that future generations can save the environment by caring for it but some have worried that lorax with his possessive use of xe cmy xe when referring to the trees and other creatures isn xe really good teaching model because he comes off as self righteous eco warrior with an unfounded anger
in an essay published monday in nature ecology amp evolution the authors argue that the lorax may not have been as bossy and ineffectual as he seems rather the authors posit that lorax may have been involved in type of symbiotic relationship with the truffula trees and his surroundings threatened and defensive
xe cthe prevailing sense among literary critics is that the lorax is too angry and that environmentalists can xe afford to adopt that kind of rhetoric because it will never work with policymakers xe said nathaniel dominy an anthropologist and evolutionary ecologist at dartmouth college and lead author of the paper xe cif you see the lorax not as some indignant steward of the environment but instead as participating member of the ecosystem then think his anger is so much more understandable and think forgivable xe
the case for the lorax xe kenyan inspiration emerged after dr dominy grasped for something to talk about at dinner with donald pease an english professor at dartmouth college praised for his lectures and biography on dr seuss and it evolved into scientific process that including feeding the lorax xe cartoon face into sophisticated monkey face recognition software
dr dominy also father raised the topic of xe cthe lorax xe suggesting that the fuzzy mustachioed protagonist of the book resembled the patas monkey fluffy orange real life creature with raspy alarm call that he had observed while working in kenya
the monkey gets most of its nutrients from gnarly tree called the whistling thorn acacia in type of interaction called commensalism wherein one organism benefits from another without harming it the tree also looks like barren trees in the story xe cif dr seuss would ever make monkey xe he told dr pease xe cthat would be the one xe
dr pease questioned the notion that creative master like dr seuss would ever use real life reference but became convinced after considering how the lorax appeared from that chopped down tree stump suggesting in way that the lorax was part of it this made the character xe use of xe cmy trees xe more reasonable
like the science times page on facebook sign up for the science times newsletter
xe cthe lorax no longer sounded like an eco policeman xe said dr pease xe cbut instead was creature that could be understood as the spirit in place for the entire ecosystem xe
to him dr dominy xe otherwise silly conversation topic deserved attention because it enriched previous understanding of the work and addressed critical concerns in what became their passion project they searched for clues to support dr dominy xe hypothesis
after scouring the literature and talking with audrey geisel the author xe wife they determined that dr seuss likely had devised his story after observing the relationship between the patas monkey and whistling thorn acacia during his kenyan vacation
they also teamed up with an anthropologist at new york university who had developed machine learning algorithm for analyzing similarities among large database of african monkey faces together they fed the faces of five real kenyan monkeys the cartoon lorax and character from xe cthe foot book xe its most common seussian ancestor they figured into program analysis revealed that the lorax looked more like the patas monkey than the foot book creature
xe cwe xe re taking real tools from biology and applying them in super serious way xe dr dominy said xe ci hope people find the humor in this xe
in the book once the forest and all its inhabitants vanish and the once ler is left with his empty factory the lorax blasts off into the sky leaving behind the rocks and the word xe cunless xe
years pass and regretful once ler finally understands these words when visitor asks what happened to the lorax he throws the last truffula tree seed to the child and says xe cunless someone like you cares whole awful lot nothing is going to get better it xe not xe
matthew teorey an english professor at peninsula college in washington state who was not involved in the study has likened the lorax to the writer wallace stegner an environmentalist who wrote an article in using the term xe cunless xe in similar argument to that of xe cthe lorax xe still he said he appreciated the new interpretation of the lorax as an indigenous person or creature of the exploited land that can speak for the environment
real monkey tree connection or not by simply acknowledging this comparison dr pease said we learn about important ecological concepts and environmental interactions xe like how removal of keystone species like the truffula tree can lead to ecosystem collapse
we xe ll never know for certain the inspiration of this cautionary tale but it doesn xe really matter dr dominy said xe cecosystems are communities they xe re assemblages of species that are interacting and if you affect one you affect all of them that xe what xe important and he nailed that beautifully xe

san francisco xe mark zuckerberg thought his fellow silicon valley billionaire elon musk was behaving like an alarmist
mr musk the entrepreneur behind spacex and the electric car maker tesla had taken it upon himself to warn the world that artificial intelligence was xe cpotentially more dangerous than nukes xe in television interviews and on social media
so on nov mr zuckerberg facebook xe chief executive invited mr musk to dinner at his home in palo alto calif two top researchers from facebook xe new artificial intelligence lab and two other facebook executives joined them
as they ate the facebook contingent tried to convince mr musk that he was wrong but he wasn xe budging xe ci genuinely believe this is dangerous xe mr musk told the table according to one of the dinner xe attendees yann lecun the researcher who led facebook xe lab
mr musk xe fears of distilled to their essence were simple if we create machines that are smarter than humans they could turn against us see xe cthe terminator xe xe cthe matrix xe and xe space odyssey xe let xe for once he was saying to the rest of the tech industry consider the unintended consequences of what we are creating before we unleash it on the world
neither mr musk nor mr zuckerberg would talk in detail about the dinner which has not been reported before or their long running debate
the creation of xe csuperintelligence xe xe the name for the supersmart technological breakthrough that takes to the next level and creates machines that not only perform narrow tasks that typically require human intelligence like self driving cars but can actually outthink humans xe still feels like science fiction but the fight over the future of has spread across the tech industry
more than google employees recently signed petition protesting million contract the company had signed with the pentagon xe deal worth chicken feed to the internet giant but deeply troubling to many artificial intelligence researchers at the company last week google executives trying to head off worker rebellion said they wouldn xe renew the contract when it expires next year
artificial intelligence research has enormous potential and enormous implications both as an economic engine and source of military superiority the chinese government has said it is willing to spend billions in the coming years to make the country the world xe leader in while the pentagon is aggressively courting the tech industry for help new breed of autonomous weapons can xe be far away
all sorts of deep thinkers have joined the debate from gathering of philosophers and scientists held along the central california coast to an annual conference hosted in palm springs calif by amazon xe chief executive jeff bezos
xe cyou can now talk about the risks of without seeming like you are lost in science fiction xe said allan dafoe director of the governance of program at the future of humanity institute research center at the university of oxford that explores the risks and opportunities of advanced technology
and the public roasting of facebook and other tech companies over the past few months has done plenty to raise the issue of the unintended consequences of the technology created by silicon valley
in april mr zuckerberg spent two days answering questions from members of congress about data privacy and facebook xe role in the spread of misinformation before the election he faced similar grilling in europe last month
facebook xe recognition that it was slow to understand what was going on has led to rare moment of self reflection in an industry that has long believed it is making the world better place whether the world likes it or not
even such influential figures as the microsoft founder bill gates and the late stephen hawking have expressed concern about creating machines that are more intelligent than we are even though superintelligence seems decades away they and others have said shouldn xe we consider the consequences before it xe too late
xe cthe kind of systems we are creating are very powerful xe said bart selman cornell university computer science professor and former bell labs researcher xe cand we cannot understand their impact xe
pacific grove is tiny town on the central coast of california group of geneticists gathered there in the winter of to discuss whether their work xe gene editing xe would end up harming the world in january the community held similar discussion in the beachside grove
the private gathering at the asilomar hotel was organized by the future of life institute think tank built to discuss the existential risks of and other technologies
the heavy hitters of were in the room xe among them mr lecun the facebook lab boss who was at the dinner in palo alto and who had helped develop neural network one of the most important tools in artificial intelligence today also in attendance was nick bostrom whose book xe csuperintelligence paths dangers strategies xe had an outsized xe some would argue fear mongering xe effect on the discussion oren etzioni former computer science professor at the university of washington who had taken over the allen institute for artificial intelligence in seattle and demis hassabis who heads deepmind an influential google owned research lab in london
and so was mr musk who in had donated million to the cambridge mass institute that same year he also helped create an independent artificial intelligence lab openai with an explicit goal create superintelligence with safeguards meant to ensure it won xe get out of control it was message that clearly aligned him with mr bostrom
on the second day of the retreat mr musk took part in nine person panel dedicated to the superintelligence question each panelist was asked if superintelligence was possible as they passed the microphone down the line each said xe cyes xe until the microphone reached mr musk xe cno xe he said the small auditorium rippled with knowing laughter everyone understood that mr musk thought superintelligence was not only possible but very dangerous
mr musk later added xe cwe are headed toward either superintelligence or civilization ending xe
at the end of the panel mr musk was asked how society can best live alongside superintelligence what we needed he said was direct connection between our brains and our machines few months later he unveiled start up called neuralink backed by million that aimed to create that kind of so called neural interface by merging computers with human brains
warnings about the risks of artificial intelligence have been around for years of course but few of those cassandras have the tech cred of mr musk few if any have spent as much time and money on it and perhaps none has had as complicated history with the technology
just few weeks after mr musk talked about his concerns at the dinner in mr zuckerberg xe house mr musk phoned mr lecun asking for the names of top researchers who could work on his self driving car project at tesla that autonomous technology was in use at the time of two fatal tesla car crashes one in florida in may and the other in march of this year
during recent tesla earnings call mr musk who has struggled with questions about his company xe financial losses and concerns about the quality of its vehicles chastised the news media for not focusing on the deaths that autonomous technology could prevent xe remarkable stance from someone who has repeatedly warned the world that is danger to humanity
there is saying in silicon valley we overestimate what can be done in three years and underestimate what can be done in
on jan google xe deepmind lab unveiled machine that could beat professional player at the ancient board game go in match played few months earlier the machine called alphago had defeated the european champion fan hui xe five games to none
even top researchers had assumed it would be another decade before machine could solve the game go is complex xe there are more possible board positions than atoms in the universe xe and the best players win not with sheer calculation but through intuition two weeks before alphago was revealed mr lecun said the existence of such machine was unlikely
few months later alphago beat lee sedol the best go player of the last decade the machine made moves that baffled human experts but ultimately led to victory
many researchers including the leaders of deepmind and openai believe the kind of self learning technology that underpins alphago provided path to xe csuperintelligence xe and they believe progress in this area will significantly accelerate in the coming years
openai recently xe ctrained xe system to play boat racing video game encouraging it to win as many game points as it could it proceeded to win those points but did so while spinning in circles colliding with stone walls and ramming other boats
it xe the kind of unpredictability that raise grave concerns about the rise of including superintelligence
but the deep opposition to these concerns was on display in march at an exclusive conference organized by amazon and mr bezos in palm springs
one evening rodney brooks roboticist at the massachusetts institute of technology debated the potential dangers of with the neuroscientist philosopher and podcaster sam harris prominent voice of caution on the issue the debate got personal according to recording obtained by the times
mr harris warned that because the world was in an arms race toward researchers may not have the time needed to ensure superintelligence is built in safe way
xe cthis is something you have made up xe mr brooks responded he implied that mr harris xe argument was based on unscientific reasoning it couldn xe be proven right or wrong xe real insult among scientists
xe ci would take this personally if it actually made sense xe mr harris said
moderator finally ended the tussle and asked for questions from the audience mr etzioni the head of the allen institute took the microphone xe ci am not going to grandstand xe he said but urged on by mr brooks he walked onto the stage and laid into mr harris for three minutes saying that today xe systems are so limited spending so much time worrying about superintelligence just doesn xe make sense
the people who take mr musk xe side are philosophers social scientists writers xe not the researchers who are working on he said among scientists the notion that we should start worrying about superintelligence is xe cvery much fringe argument xe
since their dinner three years ago the debate between mr zuckerberg and mr musk has turned sour last summer in live facebook video streamed from his backyard as he and his wife barbecued mr zuckerberg called mr musk xe views on xe cpretty irresponsible xe
panicking about now so early in its development could threaten the many benefits that come from things like self driving cars and health care he said
xe cwith especially xe really optimistic xe mr zuckerberg said xe cpeople who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios xe just don xe understand it xe
in other words you xe re getting ahead of reality elon relax
mr musk responded with tweet xe ci xe ve talked to mark about this xe mr musk wrote xe chis understanding of the subject is limited xe
in april mr zuckerberg testified before congress explaining how facebook was going to fix the problems it had helped create
one way to do it by leaning on artificial intelligence but in his testimony mr zuckerberg acknowledged that scientists haven xe exactly figured out how some types of artificial intelligence are learning
xe cthis is going to be very central question for how we think about systems over the next decade and beyond xe he said xe cright now lot of our systems make decisions in ways that people don xe really understand xe
tech bigwigs and scientists may mock mr musk for his chicken little routine on but they seem to be moving toward his point of view
inside google group is exploring flaws in methods that can fool computer systems into seeing things that are not there researchers are warning that systems that automatically generate realistic images and video will soon make it even harder to trust what we see online both deepmind and openai now operate research groups dedicated to xe ca safety xe
mr hassabis the founder of deepmind still thinks mr musk xe views are extreme but he said the same about the views of mr zuckerberg the threat is not here he said not yet but facebook xe problems are warning
xe cwe need to use the downtime when things are calm to prepare for when things get serious in the decades to come xe said mr hassabis xe cthe time we have now is valuable and we need to make use of it xe

san francisco xe you can think of it as world cup of biochemical research
every two years hundreds of scientists enter global competition tackling biological puzzle they call xe cthe protein folding problem xe they try to predict the three dimensional shape of proteins in the human body no one knows how to solve the problem even the winners only chip away at it but solution could streamline the way scientists create new medicines and fight disease
mohammed alquraishi biologist who has dedicated his career to this kind of research flew in early december to cancun mexico where academics were gathering to discuss the results of the latest contest as he checked into his hotel five star resort on the caribbean he was consumed by melancholy
the contest the critical assessment of structure prediction was not won by academics it was won by deepmind the artificial intelligence lab owned by google xe parent company
xe ci was surprised and deflated xe said dr alquraishi researcher at harvard medical school xe cthey were way out in front of everyone else xe
deepmind specializes in xe cdeep learning xe type of artificial intelligence that is rapidly changing drug discovery science growing number of companies are applying similar methods to other parts of the long enormously complex process that produces new medicines these techniques can speed up many aspects of drug discovery and in some cases perform tasks typically handled by scientists
xe cit is not that machines are going to replace chemists xe said derek lowe longtime drug discovery researcher and the author of in the pipeline widely read blog dedicated to drug discovery xe cit xe that the chemists who use machines will replace those that don xe xe
after the conference in cancun dr alquraishi described his experience in blog post the melancholy he felt after losing to deepmind gave way to what he called xe ca more rational assessment of the value of scientific progress xe
but he strongly criticized big pharmaceutical companies like merck and novartis as well as his academic community for not keeping pace
xe cthe smartest and most ambitious researchers wanting to work on protein structure will look to deepmind for opportunities instead of merck or novartis xe he wrote xe cthis fact should send chills down the spines of pharma executives but it won xe because they xe re clueless rudderless and asleep at the helm xe
the big pharma companies see the situation differently though merck is not exploring protein folding because its researchers believe its potential impact would be years away it is applying deep learning to other aspects of its drug discovery process
xe cwe have to connect so many other dots xe said juan alvarez associate vice president of computational and structural chemistry at merck
in the spring of after making headlines with systems that played complex games like the ancient board game go deepmind researchers were looking for new challenges so they held xe chackathon xe at company headquarters in london
working with two other computer scientists the deepmind researcher rich evans homed in on protein folding they found game that simulated this scientific task they built system that learned to play the game on its own and the results were promising enough for deepmind to greenlight full time research project
the protein folding problem asks straightforward question can you predict the physical structure of protein xe its shape in three dimensions
if scientists can predict protein xe shape they can better determine how other molecules will xe cbind xe to it xe attach to it physically xe and that is one way drugs are developed drug binds to particular proteins in your body and changes their behavior
in the latest contest deepmind made these predictions using xe cneural networks xe complex mathematical systems that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data by analyzing thousands of proteins neural network can learn to predict the shape of others
this is the same deep learning technology that recognizes faces in the photos you post to facebook over the past decade the technology has reinvented wide range of internet services consumer products robotic devices and other areas of scientific research
many of the academics who competed used methods that were similar to what deepmind was doing but deepmind won the competition by sizable margin xe it improved the prediction accuracy nearly twice as much as experts expected from the contest winner
deepmind xe victory showed how the future of biochemical research will increasingly be driven by machines and the people who oversee those machines
this kind of research benefits from enormous amounts of computing power and deepmind can lean on the massive computer data centers that underpin google the lab also employs many of the world xe top researchers who know how to get the most out of this hardware
xe cit allows us to be much more creative to try many more ideas often in parallel xe said demis hassabis the chief executive and co founder of deepmind which google acquired for reported million in
universities and big pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to match those resources but thanks to cloud computing services offered by google and other tech giants the price of computing power continues to drop dr alquraishi urged the life sciences community to shift more attention toward the kind of work practiced by deepmind
some researchers are already moving in that direction many start ups like atomwise in san francisco and recursion in salt lake city are using the same artificial intelligence techniques to accelerate other aspects of drug discovery recursion for instance uses neural networks and other methods to analyze images of cells and learn how new drugs affect these cells
the big pharma companies are also beginning to explore these methods sometimes in partnership with start ups
xe ceveryone is trending up in this area xe said jeremy jenkins the head of data science for chemical biology and therapeutics at novartis xe cit is like turning big ship and think these methods will eventually scale to the size of our entire company xe
mr hassabis said deepmind was committed to solving the protein folding problem but many experts said that even if it was solved more work was needed before doctors and patients benefited in any practical way
xe cthis is first step xe said david baker the director of the institute for protein design at the university of washington xe cthere are so many other steps still to go xe
as they work to better understand the proteins in the body for instance scientists must also create new proteins that can serve as drug candidates dr baker now believes that creating proteins is more important to drug discovery than the xe cfolding xe methods being explored and this task he said is not as well suited to deepmind style
deepmind researchers focus on games and contests because they can show clear improvement in artificial intelligence but it is not clear how that approach translates to many tasks
xe cbecause of the complexity of drug discovery we need wide variety of tools xe dr alvarez said xe cthere is no one size fits all answer xe

my recent reporting has highlighted why racial exclusion in xe cthe queen of the sciences xe xe may matter most of all
by amy harmon
times insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind the scenes insights into how our journalism comes together
for an article that ran on tuesday xe front page interviewed dozen or so black mathematicians about the subtle racial slights they have been subjected to by white and asian colleagues among them several took pains to note that theirs is not the only field typified by what one called xe cthe racism of educated people xe
xe cunconscious bias is problem for academics in general xe said danny krashen an algebraist at rutgers who has learned reliable techniques for deflecting race related skepticism from peers when it arises academics are prone to xe cassume we xe re immune xe to assorted prejudices he said xe cbecause we think of ourselves as smarter xe
medieval studies high energy physics journalism and hollywood have all drawn deserved scrutiny for their abiding tolerance for extreme racial imbalance xe xc xa not to mention corporate law and the silicon valley technosphere but the unusually candid blog post that served as the inspiration for my article happened to be written by black mathematician edray goins there were several reasons felt that the toll this type of bigotry xe which often goes undocumented xe takes on black mathematicians was worth reporting on
one is the sheer magnitude of the underrepresentation of black academics in research math according to the american mathematical society there are tenured mathematicians at the math departments of the united states universities that produce the most math ph no one tallies the number of black mathematicians in those departments but as best can tell there are that comes to seven tenths of percent of the total xe perhaps as far as any job classification gets from accurately reflecting the share of black americans in the general adult population which stands at percent
maybe it seems like splitting already ludicrously fine hairs but in biomedicine the share of black scientists who receive major research grants from the national institutes of health percent is about twice as high as the share of black mathematicians on the tenured faculty of top united states math departments the share of employees at facebook who are black percent is roughly six times higher the share of black graduates from united states medical schools percent nine times higher among the film and television agents at hollywood xe top four talent agencies according to recent new york times article black agents number in the dozens which makes their share roughly eight times that of the black mathematicians
xe cto say that feel isolated is an understatement xe dr goins wrote
then there is the cost of that underrepresentation to the public in the private sector shareholders bear the opportunity lost by excluding demographic groups but mathematics research is funded largely by taxpayers federal agencies distributed some million in grants to american universities for basic math research alone in and math xe xe cthe queen of the sciences xe as the th century mathematician carl friedrich gauss is said to have labeled his discipline xe underpins virtually all of the tens of billions of dollars worth of basic science research that americans support each year
xe chow much further forward might mathematics have gotten today xe richard taylor prominent white mathematician at stanford wrote in an email xe cif we had attracted that talent xe
and there is the matter of the people who don xe get shot at charting the mathematical universe for living most of the hand wringing about underrepresentation of racial minority groups in science technology engineering and math is centered for good reason on the economic injustice so called stem jobs whether in finance or machine learning or academia pay nearly twice the national average according to the bureau of labor statistics
but research mathematicians frequently suggest that their work is closer to poetry or painting than other sciences concept perhaps best illustrated by an xkcd cartoon bearing the legend xe cfields arranged by purity xe with physicists claiming dominion over chemists biologists psychologists and sociologists all spaced the same width apart xe cit xe nice to be on top xe until the figure representing the mathematicians far off in the distance turns to notice the cluster to her left xe coh hey xe she says xe ci didn xe see you guys all the way over there xe
as daniel zaharopol the director of program for mathematically talented low income middle school students put it when interviewed him for article xe cmath is beautiful and being part of that should not be limited to just some people xe
some people claim that there are not many black research mathematicians because african americans are not as intelligent as other races these people whom have reported on for other stories in recent months almost invariably use mathematical accomplishment as their yardstick for intelligence they note that no individuals of african descent have won the fields medal math xe equivalent of the nobel prize they lack any genetic evidence to explain the gap in average scores between white and black americans that they cite as the basis of their belief or reason to think that genetic trait would be impervious to social or educational intervention or that high is key to math ab lity which timothy gowers fields medalist has attributed largely to xe cthe capacity to become obsessed with math problem xe
but have been reporting on these topics for several years and am acutely aware that math prowess factors heavily into the popular conception of intelligence there xe vicious cycle at work the lack of african american representation in math can end up feeding pernicious biases which in turn add to the many obstacles mathematically talented minorities face which was one more reason it seemed especially important to hold up to the light all the racial biases that contribute to that underrepresentation
that includes the well documented racial disparities in public school resources the selection of students for gifted programs xe and the fact that having parent with ph is helpful to getting one in math while black children are less than half as likely as white children to live with such parent
learned some of the math specific history of racial exclusion too from dr goins xe speech at last month xe math conference in baltimore in when the leadership of the nearly all white american mathematical society counseled members to reject resolution to address the shortage of black and hispanic mathematicians in its ranks white mathematician lee lorch wrote in protest
xe cdo we care only for those already in the profession xe dr lorch had written xe cis the society willing to accept the present nearly complete exclusion from our mathematical manpower pool of black america xe
yesterday it echoed in my mind when saw tweet responding to sentence in my story referring to columbia university administrator xe conclusion that xe cprogress would hinge partly on majority group faculty members xe adjusting their personal behavior xe
xe cthat xe us xe kevin covey white astronomer at western washington university said xe cthings won xe change unless we change xe

there is probably never good time for an auto empire to have its leader thrown in jail but for nissan and renault the arrest of carlos ghosn comes at an especially inopportune moment
the two carmakers can ill afford turmoil in the alliance headed by mr ghosn when the global auto market is entering downturn trade war provoked by the trump administration is interfering with supply chains and silicon valley is spawning well financed new competitors
mr ghosn xe arrest in tokyo this week on suspicion that he deceived japanese authorities about his pay package exposed deep fissures in the union between renault and nissan that he engineered in and which mitsubishi motors joined in
whatever the outcome of legal proceedings against mr ghosn he is unlikely to regain his previous stature instead analysts said there could be destructive power struggle within the alliance as nissan tries to assert more control renault has been the dominant partner of the three carmakers even though nissan sells more cars state of affairs that appears to rankle executives in tokyo
hiroto saikawa the chief executive of nissan made no attempt to disguise his enmity toward mr ghosn after his arrest monday even though mr ghosn has not been formally charged with crime mr saikawa told reporters monday that his boss xe behavior had been intolerable and he would recommend his removal as the company xe chairman
the nissan board followed through on thursday with unanimous vote to remove mr ghosn as chairman and to eliminate greg kelly board member and former human resources director who has also been implicated in the financial misconduct allegation mr ghosn stepped down as nissan xe chief executive last year but remained chairman and continued to lead the alliance also serving as chairman at mitsubishi and chairman and chief executive at renault
the board also emphasized in statement that xe cthe long standing alliance partnership with renault remains unchanged and that the mission is to minimize the potential impact and confusion on the day to day cooperation among the alliance partners xe
the statement was telling xe and fell in line with the economic realities of the industry regardless of whatever problems the two carmakers may be having in their relationship analysts say they would be in much worse shape alone other car companies are trying to get bigger joining forces with onetime rivals so they can share the enormous costs of developing electric so called self driving cars
fiat chrysler automobiles has made no secret about its desire to merge with another big carmaker ford and volkswagen are discussing cooperation on the production of commercial vehicles honda and general motors have formed partnership to develop autonomous vehicles
xe cbreaking the alliance would be very negative thing for all of the parties xe said felipe munoz global analyst at jato dynamics market research firm xe ccarmakers are realizing that being alone is more difficult going out of the alliance would be going against the trend xe
even without the turmoil caused by mr ghosn xe arrest nissan and renault were facing serious problems both suffered declines in sales and profits this year nissan revenue fell percent from july through september to trillion yen or billion the company sold million cars worldwide percent decline and profit fell percent to billion yen
renault reported percent decrease in revenue from july through september to xe xac billion or billion including its stake in russian carmaker sales of renault brand cars fell percent to vehicles renault did not report profit for the quarter but said its net income in the first half of fell percent to xe xac billion
to some extent the companies were victims of circumstances beyond their control nissan was hit by slowdowns in the united states and china the world xe two biggest car markets renault suffered from declines in emerging markets like africa and india renault also felt some collateral damage in geopolitical conflict after it bet big on iran then was forced to withdraw after the united states restored sanctions
but analysts also question company strategies that mr ghosn the dominant personality at nissan renault mitsubishi and the alliance among them championed the united states is prominent example
nissan has long been perceived as the no japanese automaker in america after toyota and honda as the auto industry recovered after the recession mr ghosn laid out new global strategy that called for increasing the company xe market share to more than percent xe about percent increase from xe in hopes of pushing past honda
to drive sales nissan heavily discounted prices often in ways that caused dealers to lose money on some sales under strategy called xe cgrow or go xe it pushed small dealerships to sell or close their franchises at the same time it favored certain xe cpreferred xe dealers by secretly paying them up to million or more to help them build plush new showrooms
while nissan achieved its market share goal for while it also alienated many dealers and even some who were profitable sold their franchises because of the company xe practices
and this year with overall united states sales flat nissan xe sales have declined percent through october it has been particularly hard hit by slumping sales of sedans
xe cthey have increased market share xe said michelle krebs executive analyst at autotrader an online buying and selling platform xe cbut they have not done it in way that is healthy xe
nissan is not in good position now that the united states market is losing steam ms krebs said
xe ccar sales are edging downward xe she said xe cother carmakers are ramping up their incentives where have they got to go they already have big incentives xe
renault would be in an even weaker position as stand alone company it is minor player in china and has no presence in the united states without substantial footprint in those two giant markets it has little hope of achieving the scale needed to bargain for the best prices from suppliers and invest in new technologies
all traditional carmakers are trying to maintain their existing businesses rooted in internal combustion engines and at the same time they are investing heavily to develop autonomous electric vehicles those new products are not yet generating profits and there is competition from companies like uber and google which are using their formidable financial resources to move into the car companies xe turf
car companies also face higher prices for steel and aluminum because of tariffs that president trump has imposed on imports from foreign producers and the levies he has imposed on chinese goods prompting retaliatory tariffs from china have interfered with the flow of car parts
those challenges may help explain why renault has been more reluctant than nissan to cut mr ghosn loose the company appointed an interim replacement thierry bollor xc xa the company xe chief operating officer but mr ghosn remains chief executive even though he occupies jail cell in tokyo apparently prohibited even from communicating with his family
sooner or later though the companies will not be able to avoid painful re examination of their relationship
xe cwe have seen there are differences xe mr munoz of jato dynamics said xe cas beautiful as it seemed when ghosn was in charge xe

economy
the federal reserve aims to keep inflation rising at an annual rate of percent that has been the lodestar of monetary policy in the united states for the past years but growing chorus of voices inside and outside the fed think it xe time for change interest rates are expected to remain low for the foreseeable future and the combination of low rates and low inflation leaves little room for the fed to respond to future economic downturns experts have advanced variety of alternatives which can be sorted into two broad categories replace the percent target permanently or agree to replace it temporarily when the economy next needs the fed xe help on monday the brookings institution will hold discussion on the alternatives that will include the former chairman of the fed ben bernanke and the presidents of the boston fed and the san francisco fed among other experts binyamin appelbaum

economy
the european central bank on thursday will publish an account of its monetary policy meeting that was held in december analysts will read the minutes even more closely than usual to see if they confirm speculation that an increasingly strong faction on the central bank xe governing council is in favor of making the current round of monetary stimulus the last the central bank said last fall that it would cut its purchases of government and corporate bonds in half in january but promised to keep buying debt at least through september with the eurozone economy exceeding expectations many economists think there will be no reason to continue the purchases after that jack ewing

programs like these have many legitimate applications they can help computer security experts probe for weaknesses in their defenses and help self driving cars learn how to navigate unusual weather conditions but as the novelist william gibson once said xe cthe street finds its own uses for things xe so do rogue political actors the implications for democracy are eye opening
the conservative political activist james xe keefe has created cottage industry manipulating political perceptions by editing footage in misleading ways in low tech editing like mr xe keefe xe is already an anachronism imagine what even less scrupulous activists could do with the power to create xe cvideo xe framing real people for things they xe ve never actually done one harrowing potential eventuality fake video and audio may become so convincing that it can xe be distinguished from real recordings rendering audio and video evidence inadmissible in court

the technology isn xe quite there princess leia was little wooden if you looked carefully but it xe closer than you might think and even when fake video isn xe perfect it can convince people who want to be convinced especially when it reinforces offensive gender or racial stereotypes

the next step would be one we are already familiar with the exploitation of the algorithms used by social media sites like twitter and facebook to spread stories virally to those most inclined to show interest in them even if those stories are fake
it might be impossible to stop the advance of this kind of technology but the relevant algorithms here aren xe only the ones that run on computer hardware they are also the ones that undergird our too easily hacked media system where garbage acquires the perfumed scent of legitimacy with all too much ease editors journalists and news producers can play role here xe for good or for bad

this gives them built in incentive to spread informational viruses that enfeeble the very democratic institutions that allow free media to thrive cable news shows consider it their professional duty to provide xe cbalance xe by giving partisan talking heads free rein to spout nonsense xe or amplify the nonsense of our current president

ibm reported revenue growth for the first time in five and half years on thursday ending streak of consecutive quarters of shrinking sales
the gain was modest xe revenue rose by percent xe and one quarter does not make trend the quarterly result will also not erase the doubts of industry analysts who are skeptical that genuine turnaround is underway at ibm
but the company xe fourth quarter report is an encouraging sign that ibm xe financial performance is stabilizing and perhaps the transformation effort led by virginia rometty the chief executive is gaining ground the company xe long run of slipping revenue began shortly after ms rometty took over in
the corporate technology giant is remaking itself and investing heavily in new businesses like cloud computing data analytics and artificial intelligence the litmus test of success will be when those new units grow large enough to more than offset the steady erosion of its traditional hardware and software products delivering revenue growth consistently
in statement ms rometty noted the strong growth in the new businesses which ibm collectively calls xe cstrategic imperatives xe and now represent percent of the company xe revenue xe cwe are pleased with our overall revenue growth in the quarter xe she said company executives said they expected revenue growth to continue throughout
in after hours trading ibm shares fell percent the company xe shares had risen nearly percent this year and some investors were apparently expecting stronger results
like other large international corporations ibm has kept some of its global profits off its domestic books to avoid the previous percent federal corporate tax rate under the new tax law companies get one time repatriation of those profits at tax rates ranging from percent to percent
to benefit from the program ibm took billion charge against profits to pay those taxes but it did not immediately say how many billions of dollars would be repatriated or what the company plans to do with the money
ibm reported revenue of billion in the fourth quarter of surpassing the average estimate of analysts of billion as compiled by thomson reuters
revenue was helped by the weakness of the dollar since most of ibm xe sales are outside the united states excluding the currency gain the company xe sales rose percent
ibm reported net loss for the quarter of billion because of the billion charge
the company xe operating earnings per share were an percent increase and slightly above the consensus wall street estimate of share
ibm got lift in the quarter from strong sales of new line of mainframe computers revenue from its systems division which includes mainframes rose percent to billion
the company xe new businesses grew percent to billion over the full year ibm said and the cloud business alone grew by percent
but its big technology consulting and services business did not grow in the quarter and declined slightly without the currency gains in the quarter

tech we xe re using
by emma fitzsimmons
how do new york times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives emma fitzsimmons reporter for the times who covers new york city transit discussed the tech she xe using
what tech tools are most important to stay on top of your beat covering new york city transportation
take the subway to our newsroom in times square every day and experience the constant delays that new yorkers love to complain about right now xe focused on what xe being done to fix the system and whether it xe working monitor the metropolitan transportation authority xe website to see if trains are running on time and use twitter to find riders who are swept up in major incidents
the is working to overhaul its dilapidated equipment but it is also trying to communicate better with riders my station in washington heights recently got countdown clocks that show when the next train is coming also use the subway time app which lists train arrival information by station it makes such difference knowing if you xe re going to be waiting for two minutes or minutes there xe similar app for buses bus time
if need to be somewhere on time check the xe website before leave when moved to new york seven years ago didn xe have to do this the trains ran on time most of the time if see delays check the subway xe twitter account for more information because problems often pop up on twitter first xe ve learned what type of incidents could be small hiccup versus day ruining nightmare signal problems or xe ctrain with mechanical problems xe spells trouble and might switch to different line problem with sick passenger usually clears more quickly
also occasionally vent about my commute on twitter had my first child last fall and it really brought home the costs of the subway crisis my son xe day care closes at xe dreading the day that the subway makes me late to pick him up
what xe good about the xe informational tools and what could be better
the countdown clocks aren xe always accurate but they xe re better than nothing the xe service updates are often vague but the subway xe new leaders have promised to be more direct for instance riders will be informed when their train has hit someone on the track
you xe ve reported on the impact of uber on new york what are the pros and cons of ride sharing apps like uber and lyft
new york city is unique because it had thriving yellow taxi industry for decades before uber arrived in now lot of people have switched to uber and that has decimated the taxi business six professional drivers who owned taxis or drove for car services have killed themselves in recent months friends say they were hopeless over losing their livelihoods
but for new yorkers uber and lyft are cheap and easy travel option especially outside manhattan xe core where taxis are less common after series of controversies at uber some people are reconsidering the ethics of using the app uber drivers also complain about making low wages after the company takes its cut xe glad uber began to offer tipping option last year rarely have cash but tip my drivers few dollars in the app
how much do you rely on uber or lyft for your job
take the subway if can it xe still usually the quickest way to get around because street congestion keeps getting worse use uber for work sometimes but more often for personal trips when take my son outside our neighborhood it xe easier to use uber since the subway is not exactly stroller friendly fewer than one fourth of stations have elevators
is technology solving any of the headaches of transportation like delayed subway trains inaccurate bus schedules and never ending city traffic
technology is helping hopefully it will help even more in the coming years
elected officials in new york are considering congestion pricing proposal to toll drivers in manhattan that would raise money for the transit system while reducing traffic london and stockholm have already embraced the idea over the last decade the technology has advanced so that you can use sensors and cameras to charge drivers higher tolls at busy periods during the day
the bus time app uses gps to track buses and the uses equipment that allows bus to turn traffic light green so it can keep moving for the subway gov andrew cuomo of new york is pressuring the to embrace technology known as ultra wideband radio to upgrade its antiquated signals mr cuomo has pointed to self driving cars as model for the subway xe future
by the metrocard will be replaced by new fare payment system where you can tap smartphone or credit card on reader london already uses this technology and it xe so much easier hillary clinton and others have famously had trouble swiping the outdated metrocard at the right speed
outside work what tech products do you and your family use lot
like many millennials xe cord cutter haven xe paid for cable in decade last year my husband bought roku tv and an old school antenna it xe been nice to watch television on big screen again instead of on my phone or laptop we xe ve tried some of the streaming services like sling tv
we also use an app called snaps to share photos of our son xe self conscious about flooding facebook and instagram with photos snaps is for close family who want to see every ordinary moment
like that snaps sends email alerts to our parents when we upload new photo but there are ton of photo sharing apps and it would be great if there was one dominant service that our friends used so that we could have one place to keep tabs on all of the cuteness

the conversation started over fence dividing two backyards on one side an ecologist remarked that surveying animals is pain his neighbor an astronomer said he could see objects in space billions of light years away
and so began an unusual partnership to adapt tools originally developed to detect stars in the sky to monitor animals on the ground
the neighbors steven longmore the astronomer and serge wich the ecologist both of liverpool john moores university in england made their backyard banter reality that may contribute to conservation and the fight against poaching
the scientists developed system of drones and special cameras that can record rare and endangered species on the ground day or night computer vision and machine learning techniques that help researchers study the universe xe oldest and most distant galaxies can now be used to find animals in video footage
claire burke an astrophysicist at the university now leading the project presented the team xe latest findings at the european week of astronomy and space science on tuesday
keeping track of elusive animals especially those that are endangered isn xe trivial first it takes time and money to conduct manual counts on the ground or to shoot photos from planes in the sky with video cheaper drones and software identifying animals has become more efficient
but cameras made for daylight can miss animals or poachers moving through vegetation and the devices don xe work at night infrared cameras can help dr wich had been using them for decades to study orangutans
these cameras yield large amounts of footage that can xe be analyzed fast enough so what do animals and stars have in common they both emit heat and much like stars every species has recognizable thermal footprint
xe cthey look like really bright shining objects in the infrared footage xe said dr burke so the software used to find stars and galaxies in space can be used to seek out thermal footprints and the animals that produce them
to build up reference library of different animals in various environments the team is working with safari park and zoo to film and photograph animals with these thermal images xe and they xe ll need thousands xe they xe ll be able to better calibrate algorithms to identify target species in ecosystems around the world
the experts started with cows and humans in england on sunny summer day in the team flew their drones over farm to see if their machine learning algorithms could locate the animals in infrared footage
for the most part they could
but accuracy was compromised when drones flew too high cows huddled together or roads and rocks heated up in the sun in later test the machines occasionally mistook hot rocks for students pretending to be poachers hiding in the bush
last september the scientists honed their tools in the first field test in south africa there they found five riverine rabbits in relatively small area these shy creatures are among the world xe most endangered mammals only thousand have ever been spotted by people
the tests helped the scientists calculate an optimal height to fly the drones the team also learned that animals change shape in real time rocks don xe as drones fly over and the researchers found that rain humidity and other environmental atmospheric and weather conditions can interfere with proper imaging
the scientists are refining their system to account for these issues and in two years dr burke said they plan to have fully automatic prototype ready for testing within five years she hopes to sell systems at cost xe today just around
in the meantime these astro ecologists are also working with search and rescue groups to help find people lost at sea or in fog and starting in may they will collaborate with conservation groups and other universities to look for orangutans and spider monkeys in the dense forests of malaysia and mexico as well as for river dolphins in brazil xe murky amazon river
an earlier version of this article misstated the animal order to which riverine rabbits belong they are lagomorphs not rodents

there are parallels today to the strongest period of growth and prosperity in recent decades
by neil irwin
painful recession was fading into memory yet the expansion felt unsatisfying to many there was evidence of huge technological leaps everywhere except in the data on worker productivity and the unemployment rate was falling to levels that forecasting models predicted would trigger burst of inflation
that was the economic situation in the mid and it also describes an intriguing xe and optimistic xe possibility for the years ahead is that the parallels with the won xe end there
back then technological advances that had been building for years finally started to translate into higher rates of productivity growth economywide some feared inflation but alan greenspan the federal reserve chairman decided not to move pre emptively to choke off the expansion instead he advocated patience to see just how hot the economy could get without setting off spiral of rising prices
the result was the strongest period of growth and prosperity in recent decades
history of course may not repeat itself the mix of technological advances and sound economic policy that generated the boom simply may not materialize this time plenty of threats could send this expansion hurtling toward recession instead
trade war or emerging markets crisis or economic policy mistake could prove more powerful than economic fundamentals and some of the technological advances that seem on the verge of fueling productivity boom may take longer to develop than their enthusiasts assert
but it xe clear that some senior economic policymakers are at least open to the possibility of boom in speech last month the federal reserve chairman jerome powell discussed the experience in detail suggesting that mr greenspan xe strategy at that time was one to emulate
in many fed policymakers wanted to raise interest rates to head off the risk of inflation xe cbut chairman greenspan had hunch that the united states was experiencing the wonders of xe new economy xe in which improved productivity growth would allow faster output growth and lower unemployment without serious inflation risks xe mr powell said
xe cmeeting after meeting xe he added the fed xe policy committee xe cheld off on rate increases while believing that signs of rising inflation would soon appear and meeting after meeting inflation gradually declined xe
mr powell wasn xe forecasting that the same would happen in coming years rather he was preaching the virtues of mr greenspan xe strategy of risk management that allowed the boom to emerge
the expansion of the last nine years has been steady and successful at putting millions of people to work but it has fallen short in overall growth or in generating substantial boosts to incomes
the culprit productivity the amount of output per hour of labor has been growing slowly in the last five years it has risen about percent annually compared with percent on average since
if that changes and businesses find ways to get more production of goods and services out of each hour of work it should set the stage for higher wages and faster growth that xe what happened in the annual productivity rose an average of percent from to then leapt to percent annual rate from to
what are the chances of similar jump in the coming years with similar beneficial results economists don xe have great understanding of what drives productivity advances but there are three realistic possibilities of where gains might come from xe and they aren xe mutually exclusive
in the economist robert solow joked that xe cyou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics xe that is even as there were remarkable advances in semiconductors software and desktop computing it wasn xe evident in any efficiency improvements in the overall economy
the surge didn xe arrive until well into the and that pattern xe long lag between technological innovation and its full economic impact xe makes sense when you think about it
for example fewer corporate executives have full time secretary now than they did in the in part because of innovations like voice mail email and desktop word processors but it xe not as if companies suddenly fired bunch of secretaries on the day they got voice mail system it was gradual process as more people became accustomed to answering their own phones and typing their own memos
just because some high performing companies have started using productivity enhancing technology doesn xe mean it has spread throughout the business world by the early walmart became efficient in using computers to manage its supply chain xe at time many retailers were still using old school cash registers it would be years before the bulk of the industry caught up the walmart catch up effect was major part of the late overall productivity surge according to research from the mckinsey global institute
moreover sometimes big innovations can actually make the economy less productive while they are being introduced an automobile factory that xe installing robotic assembly line might employ many robotics engineers but also autoworkers still making cars the old way even if the innovation eventually results in higher productivity the company might need more person hours of work per car produced in the short run
what are the potential parallels in
technological optimists have argued for years that artificial intelligence machine learning advanced robotics augmented reality and other areas offer huge potential efficiency gains as in solow xe paradox from an earlier era there xe no evidence yet in the economic data but perhaps that will change as it did with an earlier generation of advances
that xe exactly what mckinsey consultants found in research published in june
one day driverless cars may be boon for productivity xe but right now they are drag on it as thousands of skilled engineers work to develop the technology without generating dime of economic output
similarly farms may eventually increase their yield with artificial intelligence that allows them to automate the pulling of weeds and the application of fertilizer electrical utilities may be able to become more efficient using smart grids hospitals may be able to deliver better care for less money when computers help diagnose patients
will technologies like those be ready for prime time soon or ever that xe the part we don xe know for sure
but there are other forces that will more clearly affect the productivity outlook in the next few years
at the root of conservative economic philosophy is that low taxes on capital along with light regulation will encourage businesses to invest more heavily resulting in more productive economy in the long run
the next few years will be test of that proposition
the corporate income tax rate was cut to percent at the start of the year from percent the trump administration xe deregulation minded appointees have had year and half to go about their work
oh and the stock market is booming and interest rates remain low by historical standards implying companies should have plenty of access to capital on favorable terms if they want to make those investments
in short this should be conducive environment for businesses to increase their xe ccapital stock xe xe the accumulated facilities equipment software and other intangible investments xe to enable workers to be more productive
is this investment actually happening the evidence isn xe definitive at this point business investment rose at an percent rate in the first quarter of and percent in the second quarter both substantially faster than the economy as whole but that was fueled in part by boom in energy exploration that was probably more tied to the rise in oil prices in than tax policy
the nascent trade war may create layer of uncertainty for businesses that have major customer bases overseas as they weigh big ticket investments working at cross purposes with the stated goal of the tax legislation
but the verdict on whether pro business policy out of washington will drive surge in investment spending with big benefits for productivity will depend on more than couple of quarters and remains real possibility
finally the tight labor market could force businesses to find more efficient ways to deploy workers
with the unemployment rate at percent near several decade low companies in range of industries have been complaining about the difficulty of finding qualified labor
this shows up in headlines about trucker shortages construction worker shortages and oil field worker shortages it may eventually show up in faster growth in wages no matter what happens to technological advances or business investment
but one distinct possibility is that it will force businesses to act more creatively and aggressively about squeezing more economic output from each hour of labor
companies could invest more heavily in new capital xe think of automated checkout kiosks at retail stores or restaurants or companies could provide extra training so that each worker can get more done
it could also happen through experimentation with new management techniques or other business practices these would show up in what economists call xe ctotal factor productivity xe
this isn xe the traditional way economists think about productivity but we see it in other contexts when the minimum wage is raised companies sometimes try to replace human labor with machines or focus on making their workers more productive
the ultralow unemployment may have the same effect in the years ahead
there is for good reason tendency to focus on the risks of what can go wrong in the economy the current expansion could become the longest on record next year which makes the recession risk talk all the more relevant
but the are reminder that there can be good economic surprises as well as bad ones predicting the future is hard and the parallels aren xe perfect but there xe reason to wonder if economic history just might repeat itself

san francisco xe eight months after one of uber xe self driving cars struck and killed pedestrian the ride hailing company is close to putting its autonomous vehicles back on the road in drastically reduced version of earlier efforts
uber was driving its autonomous vehicles on public roads in four cities xe sometimes at night xe at speeds as high as miles an hour when testing was halted after the accident starting within few weeks it plans to run the vehicles on mile loop between two company offices in pittsburgh they won xe operate at night or in wet weather and they won xe exceed uber said wednesday
but even as the company has lowered expectations its autonomous car technology has faced considerable issues the cars have reacted more slowly than human drivers and struggled to pass so called track validation tests the last step before returning to city streets according to dozen uber documents and emails as well as interviews with seven current and former employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to talk publicly about the company
the scaled down street testing would be humble return for cutting edge effort that uber xe executives once considered key to its prosperity while uber is growing fast and is expected to make its debut on wall street next year it is wildly unprofitable the company lost billion in its most recent quarter
self driving cars were supposed to help cut uber xe losses by eliminating the need for drivers perhaps the company xe biggest expense but expectations were well ahead of the technology
at recent staff meeting dara khosrowshahi the chief executive acknowledged errors in uber xe earlier driverless car efforts xe cwe did screw up xe he said in comments provided by uber
the san francisco company took its autonomous vehicles to arizona in deploying more than on roads around phoenix in march woman in tempe was fatally struck at night by one that was going along mile route it was one of about uber self driving cars being tested on roads in arizona pittsburgh san francisco and toronto
some test drivers had worried that uber was too aggressive they complained for example that software update had led to erratic driving by the cars including once when the vehicles started running red lights two self driving vehicle test drivers said
after the crash uber vowed to keep its autonomous cars off public roads until it could ensure they was safe the company issued page safety report and added more rigorous testing on closed tracks and in simulations
but as recently as few weeks ago the company xe autonomous vehicle unit uber advanced technologies group or was still experiencing track testing xe cfailures xe on different versions of its software according internal company emails
to match the reaction time of human driver at the cars needed to drive xe slower than human xe brandon basso director at said in nov email even at slower speeds the cars were passing only percent of track tests according to company documents
week later eric meyhofer who heads the unit declared that uber was going back to the faster speed would prove that the cars were xe cunequivocally worthy of being back on the road xe he wrote in an email
some engineers thought there was another reason mr meyhofer wanted to demonstrate progress to his boss mr khosrowshahi and they worried that uber was taking shortcuts to hit internal milestones according to two current employees
an uber spokeswoman sarah abboud said the company would not compromise safety to meet development goals
xe cas we have said many times before our return is predicated on successfully passing our rigorous track tests and having our letter of authorization from the pennsylvania department of transportation in hand xe ms abboud said
while uber xe cars have been off the streets its competitors have pushed ahead with similar projects
google xe autonomous vehicle unit waymo started driverless ride hailing service in arizona on wednesday another contender lyft started robotic ride hailing service in las vegas this year with the manufacturer aptiv general motors acquired the self driving start up cruise in has since netted major investments from softbank and honda and has been testing the vehicles in san francisco and other locations
mr meyhofer was confident that uber xe cars could resume street testing in the summer and he instructed engineers to start planning party to celebrate their return according to five people familiar with the plan but employees worried that party would appear insensitive and it was set aside
some changes were easy when the uber self driving car struck pedestrian its solo safety driver was watching television show on her phone and didn xe hit the brakes until after the impact according to findings from the national transportation safety board and the local police to prevent conflicts between uber xe software and volvo xe uber had also disabled an emergency braking feature that was standard in the volvo sports utility vehicles the company used
government guidelines for autonomous vehicle testing are at best piecemeal but under rules the company set for itself the testing vehicles would always have at least two people driving and monitoring their systems xe standard among its competitors xe and the braking system would be turned on
xe cit xe kind of like the wild west xe said john thomas research engineer specializing in autonomous vehicle safety at the massachusetts institute of technology xe ceveryone is just doing what they think is best xe
in july uber put its self driving cars back on the road in pittsburgh but with human drivers the resumption of autonomous testing on city streets would take longer uber laid off the majority of its vehicle operators in pittsburgh and shut down an autonomous trucking unit to focus exclusively on cars
still uber received an important vote of confidence in august with million investment from toyota with plan to install uber xe self driving system in fleet of toyota minivans
by late summer uber was planning for an oct return date but executives worried that testing on closed tracks had been xe cuncoordinated and slow xe at september software leadership retreat in montana according to internal documents
when the deadline passed mr khosrowshahi wrote public blog post cautioning that uber would not rush
xe cwe are committed to anticipating and managing risks that may come with this type of testing but we cannot xe as no self driving developer can xe anticipate and eliminate every one xe he wrote
uber pushed the return date to nov but when test in early november ran uber xe vehicles through more than categories at they failed in of them including being slow to recognize another car that didn xe yield
in an email jon thomason who leads the software efforts at urged employees not to xe cpanic xe because this wasn xe the latest version of the autonomous software ms abboud the uber spokeswoman said that some of the failures involved xe cintermittent xe braking but that the company did not consider it safety issue
number of engineers on the team anticipated that they would miss another deadline but mr meyhofer sent an email on nov declaring that as of that day uber xe autonomous system was ready for on road testing
uber still hadn xe received permission from the pennsylvania department of transportation but management was ready to declare victory ms abboud said that as of wednesday the company had not received response from the state
xe cthis is huge win xe mr meyhofer wrote xe cwe are nearly there can hardly wait to see us hit this milestone xe

some of the most critical work in advancing china xe technology goals takes place in former cement factory in the middle of the country xe heartland far from the aspiring silicon valleys of beijing and shenzhen an idled concrete mixer still stands in the middle of the courtyard boxes of melamine dinnerware are stacked in warehouse next door
inside hou xiameng runs company that helps artificial intelligence make sense of the world two dozen young people go through photos and videos labeling just about everything they see that xe car that xe traffic light that xe bread that xe milk that xe chocolate that xe what it looks like when person walks
xe ci used to think the machines are geniuses xe ms hou said xe cnow know we xe re the reason for their genius xe
in china long the world xe factory floor new generation of low wage workers is assembling the foundations of the future start ups in smaller cheaper cities have sprung up to apply labels to china xe huge trove of images and surveillance footage if china is the saudi arabia of data as one expert says these businesses are the refineries turning raw data into the fuel that can power china xe ambitions
conventional wisdom says that china and the united states are competing for supremacy and that china has certain advantages the chinese government broadly supports companies financially and politically chinese start ups made up one third of the global computer vision market in surpassing the united states chinese academic papers are cited more often in research papers in key policy announcement last year the china government said that it expected the country to become the world leader in artificial intelligence by
most importantly this thinking goes the chinese government and companies enjoy access to mountains of data thanks to weak privacy laws and enforcement beyond what facebook google and amazon have amassed chinese internet companies can get more because people there so heavily use their mobile phones to shop pay for meals and buy movie tickets
still many of those claims are iffy chinese papers and patents can be suspect government money may go to waste it isn xe clear that the race is zero sum game in which the winner gets the spoils data is useless unless somebody can parse and catalog it
but the ability to tag that data may be china xe true strength the only one that the united states may not be able to match in china this new industry offers glimpse of future that the government has long promised an economy built on technology rather than manufacturing
xe cwe xe re the construction workers in the digital world our job is to lay one brick after another xe said yi yake co founder of data labeling factory in jiaxian city in central henan province xe cbut we play an important role in without us they can xe build the skyscrapers xe
while engines are superfast learners and good at tackling complex calculations they lack cognitive abilities that even the average year old possesses small children know that furry brown cocker spaniel and black great dane are both dogs they can tell ford pickup from volkswagen beetle and yet they know both are cars
has to be taught it must digest vast amounts of tagged photos and videos before it realizes that black cat and white cat are both cats this is where the data factories and their workers come in
taggers helped ainnovation beijing based company fix its automated cashier system for chinese bakery chain users could put their pastry under scanner and pay for it without help from human but nearly one third of the time the system had trouble telling muffins from doughnuts or pork buns thanks to store lighting and human movement which made images more complex working with photos from the store xe interior the taggers got the accuracy up to percent said liang rui an ainnovation project manager
xe call the artificial intelligence is built on human labor xe mr liang said
ainnovation has fewer than taggers but surge in labeling start ups has made it easy to farm out the work once mr liang needed to get about photos in supermarket labeled in three days colleagues got it done with the help of data factories for only couple thousand dollars
xe cwe xe re the assembly lines years ago xe said mr yi the co founder of the data factory in henan
the data factories are popping up in areas far from the biggest cities often in relatively remote areas where both labor and office space are cheap many of the data factory workers are the kinds of people who once worked on assembly lines and construction sites in those big cities but work is drying up wage growth has slowed and many chinese people prefer to live closer to home
mr yi was out of job and trying to get other ventures going with elementary school classmates when someone mentioned tagging after online searches he decided it wasn xe super technical but needed cheap labor something henan has in abundance
in march mr yi and his friends set up ruijin technology which rents offices the size of two professional basketball courts in an industrial park for year it was previously the park xe communist party committee xe event space so the ceiling lights are covered with red hammers and sickles
ruijin which means smart gold now employs workers but plans to expand to after the chinese new year holiday when many migrant workers come home
unlike workers and business around the world mr yi isn xe worried that will take his job
xe cthe machines aren xe smart enough to teach themselves yet xe he said
hiring is bigger worry
ruijin xe pay of to month is higher than average in jiaxian some potential job candidates worry that they don xe know anything about others find the work boring
jin weixiang said he would quit ruijin after the chinese new year and go to sell furniture in physical store in southern city guangzhou
xe ci xe people xe person xe said mr jin xe ci xe doing labeling for the money xe
but for some former migrant workers the job is better than working on assembly lines
xe cit was the same work same movement day after day xe said yi zhenzhen year old ruijin employee who once worked at an electronic component company xe cnow have to use my brain little bit xe
most of the time customers don xe tell these data factories what the task is for some are obvious labeling traffic lights road signs and pedestrians are usually for autonomous driving labeling many types of camellia flowers could be for search engines
once ruijin was given the task of labeling the images of millions of human mouths mr yi said he wasn xe sure what it was for maybe facial recognition
roughly miles to the north in the hebei city of nangongshi hou xiameng runs her data factory out of her in laws xe former cement factory her first job out of college was labeling faces for megvii the chinese facial recognition company with billion valuation that xe most famous for its technology platform called face to this day some facial recognition systems recognize her before they do her friends because she says xe cmy face is in the original database xe
but life in beijing was too tough and expensive she and her then fianc xc xa zhao yacheng decided to move back to their hometown and start data factory ms hou xe parents would pay for computers and desks they are renovating the warehouse next door to hire more people
like mr yi ms hou doesn xe spend time thinking about the implications of her work are they contributing to surveillance state and dystopian future that machines will control human
xe ccameras make me feel safe xe she said xe cwe xe re in control of the machines for now xe

on an initial walk through this year xe ces electronics trade show was reminiscent of years past thousands of tech and gadget enthusiasts flooded the las vegas convention center for the four day event which began on tuesday to see the newest electronics that are being introduced on the market
and many new products were unveiled samsung highlighted smart refrigerator with large touch screen and voice controls huawei the chinese manufacturer showed its first high end smartphone for the united states and lg demonstrated tv that can be rolled up like yoga mat
yet the clear darling of this year xe show was not gadget but the growing amount of artificial intelligence software helping these products run the race between amazon and google to be the go to service for integration of consumer products was on full display in many booths signs prominently advertised that products worked with google assistant or amazon xe alexa the smart home car and tv all seemed to have been touched by amazon or google
xe cit xe the year of and conversational interfaces xe said gownder an analyst for forrester research
zipping along the convention floor were robots yielding host of skills one robot loomo top doubles as hoverboard and companion that can take photos another robot ipal above serves as companion to older and younger users designed by avatarmind the humanoid robot can remind elders to take medicine or greet children at the door
sony xe new robot dog aibo also stopped conventiongoers who took time to rub their hands on its hard surface head
google xe presence was easily identifiable with activation centers games and presenters walking around the convention floor but amazon dominated the arena by the sheer volume of products that worked with the alexa voice assistant like robovacuums light dimmers and even mosquito zappers
this year xe event featured more than exhibitors including start ups and covered more than million square feet
home appliances like coffee makers vacuums ovens and even the cat litter box also received an upgrade samsung xe smart refrigerator which was on display allows consumers to control other home devices with their voice and large touch screen
the mercedes benz user experience known as mbux one of many vehicle systems showcasing connected car technology was crowd favorite the in vehicle system includes touch screen and understands voice commands
on wednesday the power went out for large portion of the convention center for more than an hour many attendees mocked the irony of giant electronics show lacking electricity
an earlier version of this article misidentified one of the robots on display at the ces trade show it is loomo which doubles as hoverboard and companion that can take photos not nimbo different robot that works as an intelligent security system that can be programmed to patrol specific routes

from to the author was chief counsel to the senate judiciary subcommittee on privacy technology and the law
mark zuckerberg promises that facebook can do better to protect our privacy three times during his testimony before congress on tuesday he used the same example face recognition technology he explained should require xe special consent xe from users he left out key fact this week lobbyists paid by facebook are working with illinois lawmakers backed by facebook to gut the state xe face recognition privacy law the strongest in the nation
this should make us very skeptical about any calls for broad european style privacy law that would apply across technologies and platforms we cannot underestimate the tech sector xe power in congress and in state legislatures if the united states tries to pass broad rules for personal data that effort may well be co opted by silicon valley and we xe ll miss our best shot at meaningful privacy protections
in the passed broad privacy laws that applied to almost all personal data the united states has taken different path companies that collect consumer data can xe defraud or mislead their customers and the federal trade commission is watchdog for those standards beyond those foundational protections congress has historically protected our data through xe csectoral xe laws that set specific rules for specific industries thus records on the videos you watch your credit report health history and other kinds of data are all protected by slightly different rules
this is far from perfect system and flood of tech sector lobbying has made it worse since facebook has increased its spending on lobbying fiftyfold and the million it spent in still ranked it third behind amazon and alphabet lobbying works congress hasn xe passed single new major privacy law since update to federal health privacy rules take second to think of technologies popularized in the last nine years drones self driving cars amazon echo google home among others if it blossomed after chances are it is not regulated by any federal privacy law
what does that flood of lobbying look like from to as staffer for senator al franken then chairman of the senate privacy subcommittee worked to pass bill to force companies to ask for users xe permission before collecting or sharing records of their movements the bill would have outlawed so called xe stalking apps xe that let abusers secretly track their victims xe locations through their smartphones industry lobbyists outnumbered our supporters to yet in thanks to small coalition of privacy women xe rights and anti stalking groups we managed to pass the bill out of the judiciary committee
that xe when the lobbying really started when called meeting of industry stakeholders had to move it from our person conference table to the full judiciary committee hearing room which seats four or five times that the bill stalled it was never again brought up for vote
passing strong industry specific privacy law is tough but at least it xe possible when the obama administration tried to pass an omnibus privacy bill the law xe original framework was promising it stressed that consumers needed control of their information transparency about how it was used and accountability when it was abused in after silicon valley weighed in the bill that the white house put forward was so toothless that almost every major consumer privacy group opposed it around the time our anti stalking bill stalled remember lobbyist telling me that we should really consider setting our bill aside until congress could pass comprehensive privacy law now know why
it could be that the cambridge analytica scandal will pave the way for previously impossible european style reforms facebook xe actions tell different story even as it yells mea culpa facebook is calculating that it can kneecap new privacy rules with impunity facebook is spending its lobbying money not only to gut the illinois biometric information privacy act but also to stop new california consumer privacy ballot initiative
those calculations are right xe if we make this broad debate about xe cpersonal data xe let xe make this debate about people and pass laws to address the threats they actually face let xe talk about the people who are still stalked every year through their smartphones or how retailers secretly use face recognition to spot shoplifters even though the technology misfires more often when trying to identify african americans and women let xe make this debate about how facebook tracked people to determine if they had an xe caffinity xe for african americans hispanics and asians and then let advertisers block those people from seeing real estate ads
it xe one thing to pit internet companies against the idea of xe cprivacy xe it xe another to show lawmaker the real people in her district who will be hurt by her failure to act in justice potter stewart declared that the fourth amendment xe cprotects people not places xe it xe time to recognize that privacy protects people not data
an earlier version of this story incorrectly described the illinois face recognition privacy law it is not proposed law it is in effect

san francisco xe over years at the giant computer chip maker intel ren xc xa james climbed to its no position becoming one of silicon valley xe prominent female leaders
now she is taking aim at intel xe most lucrative business one that she helped build
ms james who announced in that she would resign from intel on monday revealed start up backed by the private equity firm carlyle group to sell chips to handle calculations in servers those computers run most internet services and corporate back office operations
intel dominates that market accounting for percent of the microprocessor chips sold for the most popular variety of server the research firm idc estimates the group that sells such chips generated about billion in revenue last year and nearly half of intel xe operating profit
ms james emphasized her respect for her former employer and played down potential competition she said her new company ampere was designing chips for new specialized jobs at cloud services that aren xe intel xe primary focus
xe ci think they re the best in the world at what they do xe ms james said of intel xe ci just don xe think they xe re doing what comes next xe
an intel spokesman declined to comment analysts said the company had developed variety of products to serve the kinds of companies that ampere is courting
intel whose chips helped drive the personal computer revolution was once the underdog in the data center in the the company gradually increased the power of its chips and added features needed for servers the rising performance and much lower price of such machines eventually supplanted hardware from companies like ibm
ms james who received business degrees from the university of oregon and started in marketing jobs at intel aided the server push by encouraging development of software needed to thrive in the market among other efforts
xe cshe known as the person who put software on the map at intel xe said patrick moorhead an industry analyst at moor insights amp strategy
ms james later spearheaded major intel software acquisitions including billion purchase of the security specialist mcafee in six years later intel agreed to sell majority stake of that business to the investment firm tpg
ms james was considered candidate to succeed paul otellini who stepped down as intel chief executive in may instead she and brian krzanich successfully pitched intel directors on joint plan to run the company
she was named president the highest ranking job ever held by woman at the company and mr krzanich became chief executive ms james later decided to seek chief executive spot elsewhere opting in early to first become an operating executive at carlyle
ms james learned management skills from andrew grove the acclaimed former intel chief before he died in she said mr grove encouraged her to follow her dream of chip start up xe plan with parallels to the founding of intel as breakaway from chip pioneer fairchild semiconductor
xe che said xe just want you to know this is really hard job xe xe ms james recalled xe ci said xe know but it xe so much fun xe xe
her venture is the latest in series of largely unsuccessful attempts dating back more than seven years to shake up the server market with technology licensed by arm holdings that is used as mainstay of smartphones one selling point is reduced power consumption hot topic in data centers
ampere xe underlying technology originated at applied micro circuits which built three generations of arm based server chips the silicon valley company was acquired in early by macom technology solutions which in october agreed to sell the business to what is now ampere essentially all of applied micro xe person development team joined the new venture ms james said
she declined to disclose how much carlyle was investing but said ampere was well funded it has recruited intel veterans and other engineers and completed its first chip which is available in sample quantities she said the start up is based not far from intel xe headquarters
ampere won xe lack for competition besides intel longtime rival advanced micro devices has new line of server chips that have landed some customers qualcomm the biggest mobile chip maker unveiled an arm based server chip in november marvell technology and cavium which have agreed to merge also sell arm server chips
ms james sounds undaunted she said ampere xe chips topped rival products on price speedy connections to retrieve data from memory and other features more broadly she said the market has changed because of advances in software manufacturing technology and renewed investor interest in start ups pursuing specialties such as machine learning
xe cthere lot of excitement around silicon again xe she said

how to create more diverse workplaces and how to use artificial intelligence ethically are among the more challenging dilemmas facing business and government
while the issues may appear to have little in common besides their complexity they do overlap recently for example according to news reports amazon abandoned hiring tool that used artificial intelligence because it favored men
these topics were the subject of two separate task forces that met at last week xe dealbook conference each task force composed of about dozen experts and industry leaders met for an hour emerging with some specific guidelines and focus areas that were shared with the conference and could be taken back to companies and other organizations for discussion
companies must be aware of and recognize that algorithms are not neutral but created by humans with biases and beliefs and make every effort to eliminate those biases
it is far too easy to assume that technology has an objectivity that humans don xe but the reality is that xe cartificial intelligence and machine learning and algorithms in general are designed by none other than us xe people xe said dipayan ghosh fellow at the shorenstein center on media politics and public policy at the harvard kennedy school
xe ca takes input data and races off to make inference and decision making about the world at lightening pace xe he said and those inferences will include unacknowledged biases unless people are willing to recognize them and invest the time and money to weed them out
frida polli co founder and chief executive of pymetrics which uses to recruit employees for companies showed how biases could arise and how they could be diminished
algorithms used in are created using training data sets if training data has an overrepresentation of any gender or ethnicity the features that distinguish that group may be overweighted
to confront the problem she said her company tested an algorithm on reference group of people of different genders and ethnicities to check for bias if there xe an imbalance in the test run xe far more men for example or whites are predicted to be good hires rather than women or other races xe then xe cwe can look at de weighting features xe she said that alter the algorithm
technology companies can and should help the government xe and the military in particular xe develop and use artificial intelligence but it must be done thoughtfully and carefully
one of the first issues to arise in the task force was microsoft xe decision announced last month to bid on billion cloud computing contract for the pentagon this was after google dropped out of the bid and told the military it would not provide products to build more accurate drones or compete with china in creating weaponry
xe cthe debate is ongoing about when and how to share technology with the government and specifically should companies share digital technology with the military xe said peggy johnson executive vice president of business development at microsoft
most of the task force agreed that partnerships between technology companies and government on could be beneficial but serkan piantino founder and chief executive of spell company that builds tools for those building technology said there should be limits
xe cautomating the process to use lethal force is something wouldn xe be comfortable doing given how little we know with what is going on with algorithms xe he said
requires transparency within the companies building and using it and with the public
having company employees debate and speak out on potentially controversial issues involving xe such as at microsoft xe is one form of transparency dennis crowley co founder and executive chairman of foursquare said his company had internal discussions when making business decisions that might have ethical implications
xe csometimes we have the opportunity to create more evil than good and we need to talk about that xe he said one example he said was whether his company would work with fast food chains that wanted to target those using cannabis dispensaries where it was legal it hadn xe been done before
xe cthis was right on the edge so we went to the ethics committee xe mr crowley said in the end xe cwe decided to do the campaign it was legal and clever and good use of technology around category where we don xe see lot of advertising xe
cordell schachter the chief technology officer for the new york city transportation department noted that transparency would be crucial with those creating the city xe future transportation technology which would be driven by
xe cwe want to see the data xe and not cherry picked data xe before it goes on the streets xe he said
companies should set targets and goals along with incentives as way to foster more diverse staff but they shouldn xe be used in vacuum
xe caspirational goals are important but xe it xe just not enough xe said stephanie cohen chief strategy officer for goldman sachs xe cit xe not enough to say you want to get the world or your company to xe there needs to be transparency around that xe
that means what specifically is the goal and what is the company doing to achieve that goal xe xe cboth good and bad xe she said
xe cthere is growing body of evidence that suggests cognitive diversity contributes to better decision making at the board level xe said cyrus taraporevala president and chief executive of state street global advisors xe cstudies show that diverse boards pay more attention to risk management and are less susceptible to cronyism and group think xe
but there xe danger that goals become items to be checked rather than real change damien hooper campbell chief diversity officer at ebay said that while setting goals and targets for diversity was important xe and backing it up with real costs such as bonus deductions if the goals aren xe met xe you also have to xe cmeet company where it is xe
if company has just begun to focus on diversifying its work force it needs to be educated on how to do it over time he said xe cpeople talk about how businesses measure widgets and productivity so they can measure this too but there xe big difference between widgets and human beings xe
federal policies and legislation can play role in promoting diversity in the workplace
developing laws and policy to create diversity is not always popular idea but some say they believe that there are areas where government can help john hope bryant founder and chairman of operation hope community organization said there was need for federal policy to give credit to companies that offer internships and apprenticeships when the effort is aimed at women and people of color xe cyou should get double credit for that double reach xe
federal policy to encourage paid family leave would also play crucial role in promoting diversity said sallie krawcheck chief executive and co founder of ellevest digital financial adviser for women
federal policy could also help ensure that the information companies report on the makeup of their work forces and the compensation are truly transparent for example in britain many public private and voluntary sector companies are required to disclose average pay for men and women including bonuses
in the united states said lauren taylor wolfe managing partner of impactive capital xe ca lot of companies decide what they disclose and what not to disclose if it xe not done by level it xe not real transparency xe
to be truly diverse and inclusive company must change its culture xe and that has to come from the top down
xe cyou can have policy and tactics but if the culture is not ready to receive it it will be an organ reject xe said thasunda duckett the chief executive of consumer banking at jpmorgan chase
or as ms taylor wolfe noted xe ccompanies get what they celebrate and if they celebrate diversity they xe ll get it xe
no one expects cultural change to happen quickly but one of the important elements ms duckett said is that bosses need to xe cmanage to the difference xe don xe manage everyone the same and expect the same results
after all parents don xe expect each child to be the same xe they parent differently depending on child xe personality strengths and weaknesses she said managers have to do the same
she also noted that diversity was not the same as inclusion and companies must be aware of that xe cdiversity xe she said xe cis being invited to the party inclusion is being asked to dance xe
finally change may seem glacially slow but mr hooper campbell said people shouldn xe be surprised xe cit wasn xe but years ago that couldn xe go to school with some of the people in this room xe

blame has been cast on events like brexit but there are other changes that are reshaping the industry globally
by amie tsang
automakers in quick succession have moved in recent weeks to end parts of their operations in europe nissan is the latest on tuesday it confirmed that it would cease assembling infiniti cars at its plant in northeast england
the moves during britain xe wrenching debate over its departure from the european union known as brexit have raised the question is brexit forcing the carmaking industry out of britain
it xe not quite so simple traditional car manufacturers in britain and in europe over all have been buffeted by forces around the world and they assess where they want to make the next model of car every few years or so
as automakers allocate resources they have been balancing the need to respond to these changes with the justifications for producing cars in places like britain
here are some of the forces reshaping the industry
honda said it would close its plant in swindon england by and stop making one of its sedans in turkey the swindon plant employs and the turkish plant about
nissan reversed an earlier decision by deciding to produce the next generation of its trail sport utility vehicle in japan instead of sunderland england its luxury brand infiniti is withdrawing from western europe altogether
ford said in january that it would cut thousands of jobs across europe
jaguar land rover announced in january that it would be cutting people from its global work force most of the cuts are expected to be in britain
dyson which is developing an electric car moved its headquarters from britain to singapore the same month
general motors pulled out of europe in selling the opel and vauxhall brands
in the wake of volkswagen xe diesel cheating scandal in when it used software to trick emissions tests awareness of the harmful effects of fossil fuels has prompted stricter regulation throughout the continent
some german cities are banning older diesel engines in an effort to reduce pollution in urban areas london has initiated levy on drivers of older diesel vehicles britain and france plan to phase out sales of new diesel and gasoline powered cars by
volkswagen admitted that million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests this is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners
in the meantime more governments drivers and carmakers are pivoting to electric vehicles cars running on alternative fuels made up percent of new car registrations last year in europe up from percent in according to jato an auto industry research firm
norway is aiming to sell only electric cars by while india is aiming to be all electric by
carmakers are racing to respond volkswagen said tuesday that it intended to sell million electric cars over the next years compared with its previous goal of million and that the company would aim to be carbon neutral by
the investments necessary for building electric cars have added to cost pressures for automakers that in some cases have struggled to turn profit in europe
in justifying the closing of its swindon factory honda said it wanted to focus on electrification xe cthe significant challenges of electrification will see honda revise its global manufacturing operations and focus activity in regions where it expects to have high production volumes xe the company said
as carmakers channel billions of dollars into grabbing portion of the electric car market many are looking to china which is the world xe largest maker and seller of electric cars
china wants one in every five cars sold to run on an alternative fuel by and officials have said the country will get rid of internal combustion engines in new cars altogether the country xe rules also require carmakers to sell more alternative energy cars if they want to continue selling regular models
this has prompted car companies to realign where they make and develop cars
tesla has opened factory there volkswagen signed an agreement with the anhui jianghuai automobile group last year to develop an electric vehicle general motors has made china the hub of its electric car research and development while both renault nissan and ford have joint electric car ventures in china
in their efforts to grab share of the growing market for electric cars traditional car companies are competing not just with each other but also against technology companies
uber alphabet and tesla are channeling money into electric cars and autonomous cars while reshaping the way people travel with ride hailing services
this has prompted rivals to team up or to work with the technology companies so that they are not left behind
ford and volkswagen formed an alliance in january to share technology for electric and self driving vehicles and save money
bmw and daimler announced in february that they would collectively invest billion euros in joint venture focused on offering services like car sharing and electric charging points
audi bmw and daimler have joined forces to buy digital mapping company daimler has teamed up with uber on autonomous vehicles
bmw is working with the chip maker intel and mobileye an israeli tech company to develop self driving car it is also in partnership with ibm to use artificial intelligence to adapt vehicles to owners xe preferences
fiat chrysler is working with google on self driving cars general motors invested million into lyft and volvo provided the chassis for uber xe driverless car tests
this shift has accelerated change and added to costs said peter wells professor at the center for automotive industry research at the cardiff business school in wales and that has prompted companies to scrutinize whether they should maintain operations in markets that are not expected to grow and could become more difficult to serve
xe ccompanies around the world are having to re evaluate their positions xe mr wells said
the european car market is not growing annual car sales there peaked in at about million they xe re at about million now according to jato
it is also saturated market dominated by european marques and favors smaller cars carmakers hungry for profits generated by pickup trucks and are looking elsewhere for growth sales of in europe are still far behind those in china and the united states
the italian american company fiat chrysler said in february that it planned to expand its capacity in the united states by updating several plants they will produce large jeep models
certainly even promising regions face challenges in the united states many believe that car sales have peaked forcing the idling of some factories and the economic slowdown in china has sent car sales plummeting
but in announcing its withdrawal from western europe infiniti said it intended to focus on its in north america and its new models in china
against this backdrop the uncertainty surrounding britain xe departure from the european union has made it difficult for companies to plan ahead several car companies have said they will close their factories temporarily after the country leaves the bloc in order to adjust to the disruptions that could arise
the fear is that brexit could cause havoc with the carefully choreographed just in time production processes at assembly plants in britain more than half of the components in cars come from the european union entering seamlessly on trucks from the continent and arriving within minutes of being fitted in the final product
after brexit those trucks could face substantial delays if they must go through customs checkpoints without clear sense of the terms of britain xe scheduled departure in couple of weeks making plans for production few years down the line is more difficult investment into britain xe auto industry fell by half last year

for field that was not well known outside of academia decade ago artificial intelligence has grown dizzyingly fast tech companies from silicon valley to beijing are betting everything on it venture capitalists are pouring billions into research and development and start ups are being created on what seems like daily basis if our era is the next industrial revolution as many claim is surely one of its driving forces
it is an especially exciting time for researcher like me when was graduate student in computer science in the early computers were barely able to detect sharp edges in photographs let alone recognize something as loosely defined as human face but thanks to the growth of big data advances in algorithms like neural networks and an abundance of powerful computer hardware something momentous has occurred has gone from an academic niche to the leading differentiator in wide range of industries including manufacturing health care transportation and retail
worry however that enthusiasm for is preventing us from reckoning with its looming effects on society despite its name there is nothing xe cartificial xe about this technology xe it is made by humans intended to behave like humans and affects humans so if we want it to play positive role in tomorrow xe world it must be guided by human concerns
call this approach xe chuman centered xe it consists of three goals that can help responsibly guide the development of intelligent machines
first needs to reflect more of the depth that characterizes our own intelligence consider the richness of human visual perception it xe complex and deeply contextual and naturally balances our awareness of the obvious with sensitivity to nuance by comparison machine perception remains strikingly narrow
sometimes this difference is trivial for instance in my lab an image captioning algorithm once fairly summarized photo as xe ca man riding horse xe but failed to note the fact that both were bronze sculptures other times the difference is more profound as when the same algorithm described an image of zebras grazing on savanna beneath rainbow while the summary was technically correct it was entirely devoid of aesthetic awareness failing to detect any of the vibrancy or depth human would naturally appreciate
that may seem like subjective or inconsequential critique but it points to major aspect of human perception beyond the grasp of our algorithms how can we expect machines to anticipate our needs xe much less contribute to our well being xe without insight into these xe cfuzzier xe dimensions of our experience
making more sensitive to the full scope of human thought is no simple task the solutions are likely to require insights derived from fields beyond computer science which means programmers will have to learn to collaborate more often with experts in other domains
such collaboration would represent return to the roots of our field not departure from it younger enthusiasts may be surprised to learn that the principles of today xe deep learning algorithms stretch back more than years to the neuroscientific researchers david hubel and torsten wiesel who discovered how the hierarchy of neurons in cat xe visual cortex responds to stimuli
likewise imagenet data set of millions of training photographs that helped to advance computer vision is based on project called wordnet created in by the cognitive scientist and linguist george miller wordnet was intended to organize the semantic concepts of english
reconnecting with fields like cognitive science psychology and even sociology will give us far richer foundation on which to base the development of machine intelligence and we can expect the resulting technology to collaborate and communicate more naturally which will help us approach the second goal of human centered enhancing us not replacing us
imagine the role that might play during surgery the goal need not be to automate the process entirely instead combination of smart software and specialized hardware could help surgeons focus on their strengths xe traits like dexterity and adaptability xe while keeping tabs on more mundane tasks and protecting against human error fatigue and distraction
or consider senior care robots may never be the ideal custodians of the elderly but intelligent sensors are already showing promise in helping human caretakers focus more on their relationships with those they provide care for by automatically monitoring drug dosages and going through safety checklists
these are examples of trend toward automating those elements of jobs that are repetitive error prone and even dangerous what xe left are the creative intellectual and emotional roles for which humans are still best suited
no amount of ingenuity however will fully eliminate the threat of job displacement addressing this concern is the third goal of human centered ensuring that the development of this technology is guided at each step by concern for its effect on humans
today xe anxieties over labor are just the start additional pitfalls include bias against underrepresented communities in machine learning the tension between xe appetite for data and the privacy rights of individuals and the geopolitical implications of global intelligence race
adequately facing these challenges will require commitments from many of our largest institutions universities are uniquely positioned to foster connections between computer science and traditionally unrelated departments like the social sciences and even humanities through interdisciplinary projects courses and seminars governments can make greater effort to encourage computer science education especially among young girls racial minorities and other groups whose perspectives have been underrepresented in and corporations should combine their aggressive investment in intelligent algorithms with ethical policies that temper ambition with responsibility
no technology is more reflective of its creators than it has been said that there are no xe cmachine xe values at all in fact machine values are human values human centered approach to means these machines don xe have to be our competitors but partners in securing our well being however autonomous our technology becomes its impact on the world xe for better or worse xe will always be our responsibility

tech we xe re using
by the new york times
how do new york times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives mike isaac technology reporter for the times based in san francisco discussed the tech he xe using
you write lot about uber how many ubers or lyfts do you take week
it varies to be honest for while back in to was frequent user of both services in san francisco and new york plus since xe reporting on the companies need good grasp of what uber and lyft are up to in designing their products
but stopped using them both altogether for while because was uncomfortable with either company knowing my location even when wasn xe using the app in uber xe case and where was going to meet people while doing my job paranoia maybe but xe prefer to keep my whereabouts to myself
now xe an infrequent user mostly airport trips at or if xe stuck in no man xe land where san francisco xe public transit rarely runs call me old fashioned but like using the city metro services they xe re cheap
do you use any other transportation apps
yeah few don xe own car anymore so getting around the bay area can be pain if you need to get out of the city especially if you have pound dog in tow
if need to drive down to silicon valley for interviews usually rent car through getaround which is essentially an airbnb for people xe cars it xe pretty convenient and xe ve even struck up budding friendship with guy on my street whose car frequently rent
used car go lot in brooklyn when lived there it xe basically bunch of smartcars scattered around the city you find one using the app drive it where you want to and leave it parked wherever there xe street parking that isn xe metered it xe pretty rad
mostly right now xe using an app called transit which gives you the best route to where you want to go which could include combinations of public transit biking car sharing and just plain old walking
what is the most bizarre conversation you xe ve ever had with an uber or lyft driver
once had really scary one where guy hadn xe slept in hours and was straight up going off on all this unintelligible crazy conspiracy theory talk definitely couldn xe wait to get out of that car also reported him to lyft
other than that think xe ve been offered drugs once or twice mostly they complain about how uber treats them poorly even if they don xe know xe journalist probably not good look for these companies
you spend lot of time on social media you use twitter in way that is somewhat unconventional to many times standards does this help with work
you mean other times employees don xe use twitter the same way do am shocked
kid of course am all over the place on twitter and use it as kind of narrative of both my life and the things that interest me it xe fun stressful anxiety inducing and occasionally cathartic
but despite appearances it xe actually been very effective tool in doing my job talk to lot of people through twitter xe either in public or in private xe and feel that it xe facilitated many many connections that would have not otherwise made were not constantly rambling online for source development it xe been fantastic
outside your job what tech product are you and your family currently obsessed with
hmm probably hq trivia that app that xe literally game show on your phone my parents are even on it
oh also xe very late to this but am super into my pedometer on my iphone who knew counting my steps would motivate me to walk more editor xe note many people knew this
what xe so great about them and what could be better
hq is cool because it xe interactive it xe live and you can talk to people on twitter about it while you xe re playing it xe sort of the ideal experience of real time communicating on the internet in legitimately fun way the problem is tv shows are hits business where one is never enough so the creators will have to evolve their success into other shows over time
the iphone health app pedometer is perfect in every way am such dad
so why don xe you just buy car are you waiting for the self driving car of your dreams
between parking tickets insurance renting garage in the city monthly payment and gas it xe way cheaper for me to be car free and rent only when need one
maybe in years it xe ll be moot point and the streets will be filled with robot cars kind of hope so

christopher savoie founder and chief executive of start up called zapata offered jobs this year to three scientists who specialize in an increasingly important technology called quantum computing they accepted
several months later the cambridge mass company was still waiting for the state department to approve visas for the specialists all three are foreigners born in europe and asia
whether the delays were the result of tougher immigration policy or just red tape mr savoie xe predicament was typical of growing concern among american businesses and universities unless policies and priorities change they will have trouble attracting the talent needed to build quantum technology which could make today xe computers look like toys
it is story that is being told repeatedly in the tech industry in the united states as companies push into new technologies they are finding it harder to identify qualified engineers and researchers they are also facing tougher immigration rules for foreign born tech experts and competing with tech centers like montreal london paris and beijing
international competition is particularly thorny issue in quantum computing because one of these machines xe in theory xe could crack the encryption that protects sensitive information inside governments and businesses around the world if quantum computer can be built it will be exponentially more powerful than even today xe supercomputers
last month the white house office of science and technology policy invited experts from government industry and academia to washington for daylong policy meeting dedicated to quantum technologies several attendees including mr savoie expressed concern that the trump administration xe immigration policies could affect quantum research in academia and corporations
xe cthe concern is are we still the destination for the best and the brightest in science and engineering and technology xe said roger falcone professor of physics at the university of california berkeley who attended the meeting in washington
it xe greater problem when there aren xe that many people who understand the technology in type of artificial intelligence called deep learning for example fewer than people by some estimates can be considered genuine experts
the labor pool in quantum computing is even smaller by some accounts fewer than thousand people in the world can claim to be doing leading research in the field
the number of international students applying to physics doctoral programs in the united states fell by an average of percent this year according to study from the american physical society universities on the coasts have maintained their numbers the study said but the drop is noticeable in the middle of the country
for decades quantum computing was purely experimental when it was first proposed in the early the goal was to build system based on the seemingly magical principles of quantum mechanics over the past several years scientists have shown that they can build these machines if only on small scale
with traditional computers transistors store xe cbits xe of information and each bit is either or those are the fundamental slices of data that tell computer what to do
when some types of matter are extremely small or extremely cold they behave differently that difference allows quantum bit or qubit to store combination of and two qubits can hold four values at once as the number of qubits grows quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful
scientists who build these systems specialize in the physics of those very small or cold things which is nothing like the physics we experience from day to day
xe cthere just aren xe that many people who know how to do this xe said steven girvin professor of physics at yale university xe cthese machines are quasi hand built by ph in physics xe
over the past few years some of the country xe largest tech companies alongside growing number of start ups have begun building quantum machines for commercial customers they believe quantum computer that can surpass what computers can do now is just years away
because these machines could eventually break today xe encryption some believe there are reasons to be careful as large numbers of foreigners move into the field and to find ways of building larger pool of american born talent that can handle sensitive breakthroughs
xe cwe need to be cognizant xe of the potential for academic and industrial espionage said paul scharre senior fellow at the center for new american security washington think tank xe cthe answer is not to shut down the flow of people from abroad but to find ways of better protecting intellectual property xe
as american tech giants like google ibm intel and microsoft accelerate their quantum computing efforts work is speeding up in china and europe as well the chinese government is working on billion national lab for quantum research in hefei set to open in and the chinese commerce giant alibaba is building lab of its own in the european union invested billion euros xe roughly billion xe in quantum computing
could those efforts race past progress in the united states and possibly threaten national security xe cif you are talking about quantum computer in russia or china or anywhere else you are talking about weaponized technology xe said arthur herman senior fellow at the hudson institute think tank in washington
the good news is no one has been able to build commercially viable quantum computer so far so there is time to fix the talent problem lawmakers and government officials are exploring strategies to help ensure that the pool of available talent grows
jacob taylor veteran quantum researcher who oversees quantum strategy at the office of science and technology policy played down concerns that other countries could beat the united states to quantum computing xe cwe have been the leader in this world for long time xe he said
in artificial intelligence research many worry that too much talent is moving from academia into industry lured by high salaries bonuses and stock options in the quantum field policymakers like dr taylor hope to address this problem by funding projects at university and government labs
congress is considering bill that would allocate billion to quantum research from to the bill the national quantum initiative act has passed the house and is awaiting full vote in the senate
xe ci see the country at crossroads with quantum information systems xe said brian demarco professor of physics at the university of illinois who specializes in quantum computing and has worked with government organizations on the technology xe ci can see things not working out where the balance is not good and it derails our ability to compete xe

palo alto calif xe the medical profession has an ethic first do no harm
silicon valley has an ethos build it first and ask for forgiveness later
now in the wake of fake news and other troubles at tech companies universities that helped produce some of silicon valley xe top technologists are hustling to bring more medicine like morality to computer science
this semester harvard university and the massachusetts institute of technology are jointly offering new course on the ethics and regulation of artificial intelligence the university of texas at austin just introduced course titled xe ethical foundations of computer science xe xe with the idea of eventually requiring it for all computer science majors
and at stanford university the academic heart of the industry three professors and research fellow are developing computer science ethics course for next year they hope several hundred students will enroll
the idea is to train the next generation of technologists and policymakers to consider the ramifications of innovations xe like autonomous weapons or self driving cars xe before those products go on sale
xe cit xe about finding or identifying issues that we know in the next two three five years the students who graduate from here are going to have to grapple with xe said mehran sahami popular computer science professor at stanford who is helping to develop the course he is renowned on campus for bringing mark zuckerberg to class
xe ctechnology is not neutral xe said professor sahami who formerly worked at google as senior research scientist xe cthe choices that get made in building technology then have social ramifications xe
the courses are emerging at moment when big tech companies have been struggling to handle the side effects xe fake news on facebook fake followers on twitter lewd children xe videos on youtube xe of the industry xe build it first mind set they amount to an open challenge to common silicon valley attitude that has generally dismissed ethics as hindrance
xe cwe need to at least teach people that there xe dark side to the idea that you should move fast and break things xe said laura nor xc xa postdoctoral fellow at the center for data science at new york university who began teaching new data science ethics course this semester xe cyou can patch the software but you can xe patch person if you you know damage someone xe reputation xe
computer science programs are required to make sure students have an understanding of ethical issues related to computing in order to be accredited by abet global accreditation group for university science and engineering programs some computer science departments have folded the topic into broader class and others have stand alone courses
but until recently ethics did not seem relevant to many students
xe ccompared to transportation or doctors your daily interaction with physical harm or death or pain is lot less if you are writing software for apps xe said joi ito director of the media lab
one reason that universities are pushing tech ethics now is the popularization of powerful tools like machine learning xe computer algorithms that can autonomously learn tasks by analyzing large amounts of data because such tools could ultimately alter human society universities are rushing to help students understand the potential consequences said mr ito who is co teaching the harvard ethics course
xe cas we start to see things like autonomous vehicles that clearly have the ability to save people but also cause harm think that people are scrambling to build system of ethics xe he said mr ito is director of the new york times company
last fall cornell university introduced data science course where students learned to deal with ethical challenges xe such as biased data sets that include too few lower income households to be representative of the general population students also debated the use of algorithms to help automate life changing decisions like hiring or college admissions
xe cit was really focused on trying to help them understand what in their everyday practice as data scientist they are likely to confront and to help them think through those challenges more systematically xe said solon barocas an assistant professor in information science who taught the course
in another cornell course karen levy also an assistant professor in information science is teaching her students to focus more on the ethics of tech companies
xe ca lot of ethically charged decision making has to do with the choices company makes what products they choose to develop what policies they adopt around user data xe professor levy said xe cif data science ethics training focuses entirely on the individual responsibility of the data scientist it risks overlooking the role of the broader enterprise xe
the harvard course which has students focuses on the ethical policy and legal implications of artificial intelligence it was spurred and financed in part by new artificial intelligence ethics research fund whose donors include reid hoffman co founder of linkedin and the omidyar network the philanthropic investment firm of pierre omidyar the ebay founder
the curriculum also covers the spread of algorithmic risk scores that use data xe like whether person was ever suspended from school or how many of his or her friends have arrest records xe to forecast whether someone is likely to commit crime mr ito said he hoped the course would spur students to ask basic ethical questions like is the technology fair how do you make sure that the data is not biased should machines be judging humans
some universities offer such programs in their information science law or philosophy departments at stanford the computer science department will offer the new ethics course tentatively titled xe cethics public policy and computer science xe
the expectations for the course are running high in part because of professor sahami xe popularity on campus about students take his introductory computer science course every year
the new ethics course covers topics like artificial intelligence and autonomous machines privacy and civil rights and platforms like facebook rob reich stanford political science professor who is helping to develop the course said students would be asked to consider those topics from the point of view of software engineers product designers and policymakers students will also be assigned to translate ideal solutions into computer code
xe cstanford absolutely has responsibility to play leadership role in integrating these perspectives but so does carnegie mellon and caltech and berkeley and xe said jeremy weinstein stanford political science professor and co developer of the ethics course xe cthe set of institutions that are generating the next generation of leaders in the technology sector have all got to get on this train xe

the stunning success of alphazero deep learning algorithm heralds new age of insight xe one that for humans may not last long
by steven strogatz
in early december researchers at deepmind the artificial intelligence company owned by google xe parent corporation alphabet inc filed dispatch from the frontiers of chess
year earlier on dec the team had stunned the chess world with its announcement of alphazero machine learning algorithm that had mastered not only chess but shogi or japanese chess and go the algorithm started with no knowledge of the games beyond their basic rules it then played against itself millions of times and learned from its mistakes in matter of hours the algorithm became the best player human or computer the world has ever seen
the details of alphazero xe achievements and inner workings have now been formally peer reviewed and published in the journal science this month the new paper addresses several serious criticisms of the original claim among other things it was hard to tell whether alphazero was playing its chosen opponent computational beast named stockfish with total fairness consider those concerns dispelled alphazero has not grown stronger in the past twelve months but the evidence of its superiority has it clearly displays breed of intellect that humans have not seen before and that we will be mulling over for long time to come
computer chess has come long way over the past twenty years in xe chess playing program deep blue managed to beat the reigning human world champion garry kasparov in six game match in retrospect there was little mystery in this achievement deep blue could evaluate million positions per second it never got tired never blundered in calculation and never forgot what it had been thinking moment earlier
for better and worse it played like machine brutally and materialistically it could out compute mr kasparov but it couldn xe outthink him in game of their match deep blue greedily accepted mr kasparov xe sacrifice of rook for bishop but lost the game moves later the current generation of the world xe strongest chess programs such as stockfish and komodo still play in this inhuman style they like to capture the opponent xe pieces they defend like iron but although they are far stronger than any human player these chess xe cengines xe have no real understanding of the game they have to be tutored in the basic principles of chess
these principles which have been refined over decades of human grandmaster experience are programmed into the engines as complex evaluation functions that indicate what to seek in position and what to avoid how much to value king safety piece activity pawn structure control of the center and more and how to balance the trade offs among them today xe chess engines innately oblivious to these principles come across as brutes tremendously fast and strong but utterly lacking insight
all of that has changed with the rise of machine learning by playing against itself and updating its neural network as it learned from experience alphazero discovered the principles of chess on its own and quickly became the best player ever not only could it have easily defeated all the strongest human masters xe it didn xe even bother to try xe it crushed stockfish the reigning computer world champion of chess in hundred game match against truly formidable engine alphazero scored twenty eight wins and seventy two draws it didn xe lose single game
most unnerving was that alphazero seemed to express insight it played like no computer ever has intuitively and beautifully with romantic attacking style it played gambits and took risks in some games it paralyzed stockfish and toyed with it while conducting its attack in game alphazero retreated its queen back into the corner of the board on its own side far from stockfish xe king not normally where an attacking queen should be placed
yet this peculiar retreat was venomous no matter how stockfish replied it was doomed it was almost as if alphazero was waiting for stockfish to realize after billions of brutish calculations how hopeless its position truly was so that the beast could relax and expire peacefully like vanquished bull before matador grandmasters had never seen anything like it alphazero had the finesse of virtuoso and the power of machine it was humankind xe first glimpse of an awesome new kind of intelligence
when alphazero was first unveiled some observers complained that stockfish had been lobotomized by not giving it access to its book of memorized openings this time around even with its book it got crushed again and when alphazero handicapped itself by giving stockfish ten times more time to think it still destroyed the brute
tellingly alphazero won by thinking smarter not faster it examined only thousand positions second compared to million for stockfish it was wiser knowing what to think about and what to ignore by discovering the principles of chess on its own alphazero developed style of play that xe creflects the truth xe about the game rather than xe cthe priorities and prejudices of programmers xe mr kasparov wrote in commentary accompanying the science article
the question now is whether machine learning can help humans discover similar truths about the things we really care about the great unsolved problems of science and medicine such as cancer and consciousness the riddles of the immune system the mysteries of the genome
the early signs are encouraging last august two articles in nature medicine explored how machine learning could be applied to medical diagnosis in one researchers at deepmind teamed up with clinicians at moorfields eye hospital in london to develop deep learning algorithm that could classify wide range of retinal pathologies as accurately as human experts can ophthalmology suffers from severe shortage of experts who can interpret the millions of diagnostic eye scans performed each year artificially intelligent assistants could help enormously
the other article concerned machine learning algorithm that decides whether ct scan of an emergency room patient shows signs of stroke an intracranial hemorrhage or other critical neurological event for stroke victims every minute matters the longer treatment is delayed the worse the outcome tends to be neurologists have grim saying xe ctime is brain xe the new algorithm flagged these and other critical events with an accuracy comparable to human experts xe but it did so times faster faster diagnostician could allow the most urgent cases to be triaged sooner with review by human radiologist
what is frustrating about machine learning however is that the algorithms can xe articulate what they xe re thinking we don xe know why they work so we don xe know if they can be trusted alphazero gives every appearance of having discovered some important principles about chess but it can xe share that understanding with us not yet at least as human beings we want more than answers we want insight this is going to be source of tension in our interactions with computers from now on
in fact in mathematics it xe been happening for years already consider the longstanding math problem called the four color map theorem it proposes that under certain reasonable constraints any map of contiguous countries can always be colored with just four colors such that no two neighboring countries are colored the same
although the four color theorem was proved in with the help of computer no human could check all the steps in the argument since then the proof has been validated and simplified but there are still parts of it that entail brute force computation of the kind employed by alphazero xe chess playing computer ancestors this development annoyed many mathematicians they didn xe need to be reassured that the four color theorem was true they already believed it they wanted to understand why it was true and this proof didn xe help
but envisage day perhaps in the not too distant future when alphazero has evolved into more general problem solving algorithm call it alphainfinity like its ancestor it would have supreme insight it could come up with beautiful proofs as elegant as the chess games that alphazero played against stockfish and each proof would reveal why theorem was true alphainfinity wouldn xe merely bludgeon you into accepting it with some ugly difficult argument
for human mathematicians and scientists this day would mark the dawn of new era of insight but it may not last as machines become ever faster and humans stay put with their neurons running at sluggish millisecond time scales another day will follow when we can no longer keep up the dawn of human insight may quickly turn to dusk
suppose that deeper patterns exist to be discovered xe in the ways genes are regulated or cancer progresses in the orchestration of the immune system in the dance of subatomic particles and suppose that these patterns can be predicted but only by an intelligence far superior to ours if alphainfinity could identify and understand them it would seem to us like an oracle
we would sit at its feet and listen intently we would not understand why the oracle was always right but we could check its calculations and predictions against experiments and observations and confirm its revelations science that signal human endeavor would reduce our role to that of spectators gaping in wonder and confusion
maybe eventually our lack of insight would no longer bother us after all alphainfinity could cure all our diseases solve all our scientific problems and make all our other intellectual trains run on time we did pretty well without much insight for the first years or so of our existence as homo sapiens and we xe ll have no shortage of memory we will recall with pride the golden era of human insight this glorious interlude few thousand years long between our uncomprehending past and our incomprehensible future

donald trump poses huge dilemma for commentators to ignore his daily outrages is to normalize his behavior but to constantly write about them is to stop learning like others struggle to get this balance right which is why pause today to point out some incredible technological changes happening while trump has kept us focused on him xe changes that will pose as big an adaptation challenge to american workers as transitioning from farms to factories once did
two and half years ago was researching book that included section on ibm xe cognitive computer xe cwatson xe which had perfected the use of artificial intelligence enough to defeat the two all time xe cjeopardy xe champions after my ibm hosts had shown me watson at its yorktown heights lab they took me through room where small group of ibm scientists were experimenting with something futuristic called xe cquantum computing xe they left me thinking this was star wars stuff xe galaxy and many years far away
last week visited the same lab where my hosts showed me the world xe first quantum computer that can handle quantum bits or qubits which it unveiled in november they still may need decade to make this computer powerful enough and reliable enough for groundbreaking industrial applications but clearly quantum computing has gone from science fiction to nonfiction faster than most anyone expected
who cares well if you think it xe scary what we can now do with artificial intelligence produced by classical binary digital electronic computers built with transistors xe like make cars that can drive themselves and software that can write news stories or produce humanlike speech xe remember this these xe cold xe computers still don xe have enough memory or processing power to solve what ibm calls xe chistorically intractable problems xe quantum computers paired with classical computers via the cloud have the potential to do that in minutes or seconds
for instance xe cwhile today xe supercomputers can simulate xe xa simple molecules xe notes mit technology review xe cthey quickly become overwhelmed xe so chemical modelers xe who attempt to come up with new compounds for things like better batteries and lifesaving drugs xe xe care forced to approximate how an unknown molecule might behave then test it in the real world to see if it works as expected the promise of quantum computing is to vastly simplify that process by exactly predicting the structure of new molecule and how it will interact with other compounds xe
quantum computers process information using the capabilities of quantum physics differently from traditional computers xe cwhereas normal computers store information as either or quantum computers exploit two phenomena xe entanglement and superposition xe to process information xe explains mit technology review the result is computers that may one day xe coperate times faster than they do today xe adds wired magazine
talia gershon an ibm researcher posted fun video explaining the power of quantum computers to optimize and model problems with an exponential number of variables she displayed picture of table at her wedding set for guests and posed this question how many different ways can you seat people it turns out she explained there are xe million ways to arrange people for dinner xe
classical computers don xe solve xe cbig versions of this problem very well at all xe she said like trying to crack sophisticated encrypted codes where you need to try massive number of variables or modeling molecules where you need to account for an exponential number of interactions quantum computers with their exponential processing power will be able to crack most encryption without breaking sweat
it xe just another reason china the ibm intel microsoft and google are now all racing xe full of sweat xe to build usable quantum systems
xe cif try to map caffeine molecule problem on normal computer that computer would have to be one tenth the volume of this planet in size xe said arvind krishna head of research at ibm xe ca quantum computer just three or four times the size of those we xe ve built today should be able to solve that problem xe
and then there are all those problems we never even imagined we could model and solve universities and companies are already accessing three ibm quantum systems ranging from to qubits that are online and open source at ibm com ibmq and they xe ve already run two million quantum programs to prove out and write papers on theories that we never had the processing power before to prove
but again look at where we are today thanks to artificial intelligence from digital computers xe and the amount of middle skill and even high skill work they xe re supplanting xe and then factor in how all of this could be supercharged in decade by quantum computing
as education to work expert heather mcgowan www futureislearning com points out xe cin october budweiser transported truckload of beer miles with an empty driver xe seat xe xa in december amazon announced plans for the amazon go automated grocery store in which combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies track items and only charges customers when they remove the items from the store in february bank of america began testing three xe employee less xe branch locations that offer full service banking automatically with access to human when necessary via video teleconference xe
this will be challenge for developed countries but even more so for countries like egypt pakistan iran syria saudi arabia china and india xe where huge numbers of youths are already unemployed because they lack the education for even this middle skill work that xe now being automated
it xe why ibm xe ginni rometty remarked to me in an interview xe cevery job will require some technology and therefore we xe ll need to revamp education the curriculum is obvious but it xe the adult retraining xe lifelong learning systems xe that will be even more important xe
artificial intelligence xe cis the opportunity of our time and skills are the issue of our time some jobs will be displaced but percent of jobs will be augmented by xe added rometty technology companies xe care inventing these technologies so we have the responsibility to help people adapt to it xe and don xe mean just giving them tablets or but lifelong learning systems xe
to back that up said rometty ibm designed pathways in technology tech schools partnering with close to public high schools and community colleges to create six year program that serves large numbers of low income students tech schools offer calculus and physics alongside workplace skills xe problem solving writing and job interviewing these skills are reinforced through mentorships and internships with ibm and more than other companies kids graduate in six years or less with both high school diploma and an associate junior college degree
xe cthe graduation rates are four times the average and those getting jobs are at two times the median salary xe said rometty xe cand many are going on to four year colleges xe
each time work gets outsourced or tasks get handed off to machine xe cwe must reach up and learn new skill or in some ways expand our capabilities as humans in order to fully realize our collaborative potential xe mcgowan said
therefore education needs to shift xe cfrom education as content transfer to learning as continuous process where the focused outcome is the ability to learn and adapt with agency as opposed to the transactional action of acquiring set skill xe said mcgowan xe cinstructors teachers move from guiding and accessing that transfer process to providing social and emotional support to the individual as they move into the role of driving their own continuous learning xe
anyway didn xe mean to distract from the xe ctrump reality show xe but just thought xe mention that star wars technology is coming not only to theater near you but to job near you we need to be discussing and adapting to its implications as much as we do trump xe tweets

redwood city calif xe in the global race to build artificial intelligence it was missed opportunity
jeff hawkins silicon valley veteran who spent the last decade exploring the mysteries of the human brain arranged meeting with deepmind the world xe leading lab
scientists at deepmind which is owned by google xe parent company alphabet want to build machines that can do anything the brain can do mr hawkins runs little company with one goal figure out how the brain works and then reverse engineer it
the meeting set for april at deepmind xe offices in london never happened deepmind employs hundreds of researchers along with team of seasoned neuroscientists but when mr hawkins chatted with demis hassabis one of the founders of deepmind before his visit they agreed that almost no one at the london lab would understand his work
mr hawkins says that before the world can build artificial intelligence it must explain human intelligence so it can create machines that genuinely work like the brain xe cyou do not have to emulate the entire brain xe he said xe cbut you do have to understand how the brain works and emulate the important parts xe
at his company called numenta that is what he hopes to do mr hawkins began his career as an engineer created two classic mobile computer companies palm and handspring and taught himself neuroscience along the way
now after more than decade of quiet work at numenta he thinks he and handful of researchers working with him are well on their way to cracking the problem on monday at conference in the netherlands he is expected to unveil their latest research which he says explains the inner workings of cortical columns basic building block of brain function
how larger community of researchers react to mr hawkins xe work is hard to predict will they decide his research is worth exploring or will they write him off as too unorthodox in his methods and much too sure of himself
mr hawkins has been following his own all encompassing idea for how the brain works it is step beyond the projects of most neuroscientists like understanding the brain of fruit fly or exploring the particulars of human sight
his theory starts with cortical columns cortical columns are crucial part of the neocortex the part of the brain that handles sight hearing language and reason neuroscientists don xe agree on how the neocortex works
mr hawkins says cortical columns handle every task in the same way sort of computer algorithm that is repeated over and over again it is logical approach to the brain for man who spent decades building new kinds of computing devices
all he has to do is figure out the algorithm
number of neuroscientists like the idea and some are pursuing similar ideas they also praise mr hawkins for his willingness to think so broadly being maverick is not easily done in academia and the world of traditional research but it xe little easier when you can fund your own work as mr hawkins has
still some wonder if his self funded operation isolated from the rigors of academic interaction is quixotic adventure they have been researching the brain one little piece at time for good reason piecing how it all works together is monumental hard to fathom task
xe cit is clear we need better understanding of intelligence xe said tomaso poggio neuroscientist at the massachusetts institute of technology who introduced mr hawkins and mr hassabis xe cbut jeff is doing this the hard way xe
if mr hawkins xe work should pan out it could help researchers leapfrog over what exists today in recent years the likes of google apple and amazon have built cars that drive on their own gadgets that answer questions from across the room and smartphone apps that instantly translate languages
they relied on xe cneural networks xe which are mathematical systems modeled after the web of neurons in the brai xe to point scientists cannot recreate the brain because they understand only pieces of how it works and they certainly can xe duplicate its capabilities
xe cthe brain is by far the most complex piece of highly excitable matter in the known universe by any measure xe said christof koch the chief scientist and president of the allen institute for brain science xe cwe don xe even understand the brain of worm xe
in with an article in scientific american francis crick nobel prize winner for his dna research called for an all encompassing theory of the brain something that could explain this xe cprofoundly mysterious xe organ
mr hawkins graduated from cornell in with degree in electrical engineering over the next several years he worked at intel the computer chip giant and grid systems an early laptop company but after reading that magazine article he decided the brain would be his life xe work
he proposed neuroscience lab inside intel after the idea was rejected he enrolled at the university of california berkeley his doctoral thesis proposal was rejected too he was suffice to say an outlier
in mr hawkins founded palm computing decade and half before the iphone he had created hand held computer for the masses when he hired the company xe chief executive donna dubinsky he warned that whenever possible he would drop his work with palm and return to neuroscience xe cthat was always there simmering in the background xe ms dubinsky said
robotics acquired palm in for million about two years later mr hawkins and ms dubinksy left to start handspring palm which bec me an independent company again in acquired handspring for million in stock in
around the time of the second sale mr hawkins built his own neuroscience lab but it was short lived he could not get lab full of academics focused on his neocortical theory so along with ms dubinsky and an researcher named dileep george he founded numenta
the company spent years trying to build and sell software but eventually after mr george left it settled into single project funded mostly by mr hawkins xe he won xe say how much he has spent on it xe the company xe sole purpose has been explaining the neocortex and then reverse engineering it
inside numenta mr hawkins sits in small office five other neuroscientists mostly self taught work in single room outside his door
mr hawkins said moment of clarity came about two and half years ago while he was sitting in his office staring at coffee cup
he touched the cup and dragged his finger across the rim then he leapt to his feet and ran through the door
he ran headlong into his wife who had stopped by for lunch and stumbled toward his closest collaborator subutai ahmad the vice president of research xe cthe cortex knows the location of everything xe mr hawkins said mr ahmad had no idea what he was talking about
as mr hawkins looked at that cup he decided that cortical columns did not just capture sensations they captured the location of those sensations they captured the world in three dimensions rather than two everything was seen in relation to what was around it
if cortical columns handle sight and touch in this way mr hawkins thought they handle hearing language and even math in similar ways he xe been working on proving that ever since
xe cwhen the brain builds model of the world everything has location relative to everything else xe mr hawkins said xe cthat is how it understands everything xe
the source of tension between mr hawkins and other brain and researchers is not that they necessarily think he is wrong it xe that they simply don xe know because what he has been trying to do has been so different and so wildly ambitious
for the science to advance what mr hawkins has been working on can xe stay in silo his ideas could benefit from extensive experimentation with other neuroscientists said nelson spruston senior director at the janelia research campus research lab in virginia that focuses on neuroscience xe ca continuous cycle of testing and revising biologically inspired models of neural computation is the key to developing insightful theories of the brain xe he said
translation mr hawkins will have to open his work to rigorous scrutiny and find way to interact with researchers who most likely have never looked at the brain the way he does

the way we teach math in america hurts all students but it may be hurting girls the most
by barbara oakley
ms oakley is an engineering professor and the author of book on learning
for parents who want to encourage their daughters in stem subjects it xe crucial to remember this math is the sine qua non
you and your daughter can have fun throwing eggs off building and making papier xc xa ch xc xa volcanoes but the only way to create full set of options for her in stem is to ensure she has solid foundation in math math is the language of science engineering and technology and like any language it is best acquired through lengthy in depth practice
but for girls this can be trickier than it looks this is because many girls can have special advantage over boys xe an advantage that can steer them away from this all important building block
large body of research has revealed that boys and girls have on average similar abilities in math but girls have consistent advantage in reading and writing and are often relatively better at these than they are at math even though their math skills are as good as the boys xe the consequence typical little boy can think he xe better at math than language arts but typical little girl can think she xe better at language arts than math as result when she sits down to do math she might be more likely to say xe ci xe not that good at this xe she actually is just as good on average as boy at the math xe it xe just that she xe even better at language arts
of course it xe hard to know what xe taking place in the minds of babes but studies revealing developmental differences between boys xe versus girls xe verbal abilities alongside developmental similarities in boys xe and girls xe math abilities xe combined with studies that show that among girls self perceived ability affects academic performance xe seem to indicate that something like the above dynamic might be going on
unfortunately thinking you xe re not very good at something can be quick path to disliking and avoiding it even if you do have natural ability you can begin to avoid practicing it because to your mind that practice is more painful than learning what comes more easily not practicing in turn transforms what started out as mere aversion into genuine lack of competence unfortunately the way math is generally taught in the united states xe which often downplays practice in favor of emphasizing conceptual understanding xe can make this vicious circle even worse for girls
it xe important to realize that math is to some extent like playing musical instrument but the instrument you play is your own internal neural apparatus
when we learn to play an instrument xe say the guitar xe it xe obvious that simply understanding how chord is constructed isn xe the equivalent of being able to play the chord guitar teachers know intuitively that the path to success and creativity at the guitar is to practice until the foundational patterns are deeply ingrained the word xe crote xe has bad rap in modern day learning but the reality is that rote practice by which mean routine practice that keeps the focus on what comes harder for you plays an important role the foundational patterns must be ingrained before you can begin to be creative
math is like that too as the researcher anders ericsson has shown becoming an expert at anything requires the development of neural patterns that are acquired through much practice and repetition understanding is part of acquiring expertise but it certainly isn xe all but today xe xe cunderstanding centered xe approach to learning math combined with efforts to make the subject more xe cfun xe by avoiding drill and practice shortchanges children of the essential process of instilling the neural patterns they need to be successful and it may be girls that suffer most
all american students could benefit from more drilling in the international pisa test the united states ranks near the bottom among the industrialized nations in math but girls especially could benefit from some extra required practice which would not only break the cycle of dislike avoidance further dislike but build confidence and that sense of xe cyes can do this xe practice with math can help close the gap between girls xe reading and math skills making math seem like an equally good long term study option even if she ultimately chooses non stem career today xe high tech world will mean her quantitative skills will still come in handy
all learning isn xe xe and shouldn xe be xe xe cfun xe mastering the fundamentals is why we have children practice scales and chords when they xe re learning to play musical instrument instead of just playing air guitar it xe why we have them practice moves in dance and soccer memorize vocabulary while learning new language and internalize the multiplication tables in fact the more we try to make all learning fun the more we do disservice to children xe abilities to grapple with and learn difficult topics as robert bjork leading psychologist has shown deep learning involves xe cdesirable difficulties xe some learning just plain requires effortful practice especially in the initial stages practice and yes even some memorization are what allow the neural patterns of learning to take form
take it from someone who started out hating math and went on to become professor of engineering do your daughter favor xe give her little extra math practice each day even if she finds it painful in the long run she xe ll thank you for it and by the way the same applies to your son
barbara oakley is an engineering professor at oakland university in rochester mich and the author of xe learning how to learn xe

artificial intelligence video tools make it relatively easy to put one person xe face on another person xe body with few traces of manipulation tried it on myself what could go wrong
by kevin roose
the scene opened on room with red sofa potted plant and the kind of bland modern art you xe see on therapist xe wall
in the room was michelle obama or someone who looked exactly like her wearing low cut top with black bra visible underneath she writhed lustily for the camera and flashed her unmistakable smile
then the former first lady xe doppelg xc xa nger began to strip
the video which appeared on the online forum reddit was what xe known as xe cdeepfake xe xe an ultrarealistic fake video made with artificial intelligence software it was created using program called fakeapp which superimposed mrs obama xe face onto the body of pornographic film actress the hybrid was uncanny xe if you didn xe know better you might have thought it was really her
until recently realistic computer generated video was laborious pursuit available only to big budget hollywood productions or cutting edge researchers social media apps like snapchat include some rudimentary face morphing technology
but in recent months community of hobbyists has begun experimenting with more powerful tools including fakeapp xe program that was built by an anonymous developer using open source software written by google fakeapp makes it free and relatively easy to create realistic face swaps and leave few traces of manipulation since version of the app appeared on reddit in january it has been downloaded more than times according to its creator
deepfakes are one of the newest forms of digital media manipulation and one of the most obviously mischief prone it xe not hard to imagine this technology xe being used to smear politicians create counterfeit revenge porn or frame people for crimes lawmakers have already begun to worry about how deepfakes could be used for political sabotage and propaganda
even on morally lax sites like reddit deepfakes have raised eyebrows recently fakeapp set off panic after motherboard the technology site reported that people were using it to create pornographic deepfakes of celebrities pornhub twitter and other sites quickly banned the videos and reddit closed handful of deepfake groups including one with nearly members
before the reddit deepfake groups were closed they hosted mixture of users trading video editing tips and showing off their latest forgeries post titled xe face reconstruction for additional angles xe sat next to videos with titles like xe not olivia wilde playing with herself xe
some users on reddit defended deepfakes and blamed the media for overhyping their potential for harm others moved their videos to alternative platforms rightly anticipating that reddit would crack down under its rules against nonconsensual pornography and few expressed moral qualms about putting the technology into the world
then they kept making more
the deepfake creator community is now in the internet xe shadows but while out in the open it gave an unsettling peek into the future
xe cthis is turning into an episode of black mirror xe wrote one reddit user the post raised the ontological questions at the heart of the deepfake debate does naked image of person become naked image of person if person xe face is superimposed in seamless and untraceable way in broader sense on the internet what is the difference between representation and reality
the user then signed off with shrug xe cgodspeed rebels xe
after lurking for several weeks in reddit xe deepfake community decided to see how easy it was to create safe for work nonpornographic deepfake using my own face
started by downloading fakeapp and enlisting two technical experts to help me the first was mark mckeague colleague in the new york times xe research and development department the second was deepfake creator found through reddit who goes by the nickname derpfakes
because of the controversial nature of deepfakes derpfakes would not give his or her real name derpfakes started posting deepfake videos on youtube few weeks ago specializing in humorous offerings like nicolas cage playing superman the account has also posted some how to videos on deepfake creation
what learned is that making deepfake isn xe simple but it xe not rocket science either
the first step is to find or rent moderately powerful computer fakeapp uses suite of machine learning tools called tensorflow which was developed by google xe division and released to the public in the software teaches itself to perform image recognition tasks through trial and error the more processing power on hand the faster it works
to get more speed mark and used remote server rented through google cloud platform it provided enough processing power to cut the time frame down to hours rather than the days or weeks it might take on my laptop
once mark set up the remote server and loaded fakeapp on it we were on to the next step data collection
picking the right source data is crucial short video clips are easier to manipulate than long clips and scenes shot at single angle produce better results than scenes with multiple angles genetics also help the more the faces resemble each other the better
xe brown haired white man with short beard so mark and decided to try several other brown haired stubbled white guys we started with ryan gosling aim high right also sent derpfakes my outsourced reddit expert several video options to choose from
next we took several hundred photos of my face and gathered images of mr gosling xe face using clip from recent tv appearance fakeapp uses these images to train the deep learning model and teach it to emulate our facial expressions
to get the broadest photo set possible twisted my head at different angles making as many different faces as could
mark then used program to crop those images down isolating just our faces and manually deleted any blurred or badly cropped photos he then fed the frames into fakeapp in all we used photos of me and of mr gosling
when the images were ready mark pressed xe cstart xe on fakeapp and the training began his computer screen filled with images of my face and mr gosling xe face as the program tried to identify patterns and similariti es
about eight hours later after our model had been sufficiently trained mark used fakeapp to finish putting my face on mr gosling xe body the video was blurry and bizarre and mr gosling xe face occasionally flickered into view only the legally blind would mistake the person in the video for me
we did better with clip of chris pratt the scruffy star of xe cjurassic world xe whose face shape is little more similar to mine for this test mark used bigger data set xe photos of me of him xe and let the model run overnight
few days later derpfakes who had also been training model sent me finished deepfake made using the footage had sent and video of the actor jake gyllenhaal this one was much more lifelike true hybrid that mixed my facial features with his hair beard and body
derpfakes repeated the process with videos of jimmy kimmel and liev schreiber both of which turned out well as an experienced deepfake creator derpfakes had more intuitive sense of which source videos would produce clean result and more experience with the subtle blending and tweaking that takes place at the end of the deepfake process
in all our deepfake experiment took three days and cost in google cloud platform credits that seemed like small price to pay for stardom
after the experiment reached out to the anonymous creator of fakeapp through an email address on its website wanted to know how it felt to create cutting edge tool only to have it gleefully co opted by ethically challenged pornographers
man wrote back identifying himself as software developer in maryland like derpfakes the man would not give me his full name and instead went by his first initial he said he had created fakeapp as creative experiment and was chagrined to see reddit xe deepfake community use it for ill
xe ci joined the community based around these algorithms when it was very small less than people xe he wrote xe cand as soon as saw the results knew this was brilliant tech that should be accessible to anyone who wants to play around with it figured xe take shot at putting together an easy to use package to accomplish that xe
said he didn xe support the use of fakeapp to create nonconsensual pornography or other abusive content and he said he agreed with reddit xe decision to ban explicit deepfakes but he defended the product
xe ci xe ve given it lot of thought xe he said xe cand ultimately xe ve decided don xe think it xe right to condemn the technology itself xe which can of course be used for many purposes good and bad xe
fakeapp is somewhat finicky and hard to use but it xe easy to imagine it improving quickly said that in the future fakeapp could be used by all kinds of people to bring high budget special effects to their personal projects
deep learning algorithms he added were going to be important in the future not only as stand alone apps but as powerful components of many tech products
xe cit xe precisely the things that make them so powerful and useful that make them so scary xe he said xe cthere xe really no limit to what you can apply it to with little imagination xe
on the day of the school shooting last month in parkland fla screenshot of buzzfeed news article xe cwhy we need to take away white people xe guns now more than ever xe written by reporter named richie horowitz began making the rounds on social media
the whole thing was fake no buzzfeed employee named richie horowitz exists and no article with that title was ever published on the site but the doctored image pulsed through right wing outrage channels and was boosted by activists on twitter it wasn xe an generated deepfake or even particularly sophisticated photoshop job but it did the trick
online misinformation no matter how sleekly produced spreads through familiar process once it enters our social distribution channels the hoax gets shares and the debunking an hour later gets the carnival barker gets an algorithmic boost on services like facebook and youtube while the expert screams into the void
there xe no reason to believe that deepfake videos will operate any differently people will share them when they xe re ideologically convenient and dismiss them when they xe re not the dupes who fall for satirical stories from the onion will be fooled by deepfakes and the scrupulous people who care about the truth will find ways to detect and debunk them
xe cthere xe no choice xe said hao li an assistant professor of computer science at the university of southern california mr li who is also the founder of pinscreen company that uses artificial intelligence to create lifelike avatars said the weaponization of was inevitable and would require sudden shift in public awareness
xe ci see this as the next form of communication xe he said xe ci worry that people will use it to blackmail others or do bad things you have to educate people that this is possible xe
so here am telling you this an program powerful enough to turn michelle obama into pornography star or transform schlubby newspaper columnist into jake gyllenhaal is in our midst manipulated video will soon become far more commonplace
and there xe probably nothing we can do except try to bat the fakes down as they happen pressure social media companies to fight misinformation aggressively and trust our eyes little less every day

this article was reported and written in collaboration with propublica the nonprofit investigative journalism organization
an artificial intelligence start up founded by three insiders at memorial sloan kettering cancer center debuted with great fanfare in february with million in venture capital and the promise that it might one day transform how cancer is diagnosed
the company paige ai is one in burgeoning field of start ups that are applying artificial intelligence to health care yet it has an advantage over many competitors the company has an exclusive deal to use the cancer center xe vast archive of million patient tissue slides along with decades of work by its world renowned pathologists
memorial sloan kettering holds an equity stake in paige ai as does member of the cancer center xe executive board the chairman of its pathology department and the head of one of its research laboratories three other board members are investors
the arrangement has sparked considerable turmoil among doctors and scientists at memorial sloan kettering which has intensified in the wake of an investigation by propublica and the new york times into the failures of its chief medical officer dr jos xc xa baselga to disclose some of his financial ties to the health and drug industries in dozens of research articles he resigned last week and memorial sloan kettering xe chief executive dr craig thompson announced new task force on monday to review the center xe conflict of interest policies
at staff meeting thursday morning dr thompson and others including dr lisa deangelis the acting physician in chief who replaced dr baselga described the recent events as disruption and acknowledged that the hospital was under microscope according to several people who attended doctors said they were concerned about lack of communication from hospital leadership and one said patients were nervous that their health data was being commercialized by the institution
hospital pathologists have strongly objected to the paige ai deal saying it is unfair that the founders received equity stakes in company that relies on the pathologists xe expertise and work amassed over years they also questioned the use of patients xe data xe even if it is anonymous xe without their knowledge in profit driven venture
in addition experts in nonprofit law and corporate governance have questioned whether memorial sloan kettering one of the nation xe leading cancer centers complied with federal and state law governing nonprofits when it set up the deal the experts pointed out that charitable institutions like memorial sloan kettering must show that they didn xe provide assets to insiders for less than the fair market value
cancer center officials said that they acted properly in approving the deal with paige ai and that if successful the venture could change the future of cancer diagnosis xe cthis is an incredibly expensive undertaking xe it needs lot of money xe dr gregory raskin the hospital xe vice president of technology development said in an interview xe cwe feel this is really valuable and important technology to get developed xe
officials said that some board members invested only after early efforts to generate interest from outside companies and investors had failed but they acknowledged that they did not seek an independent valuation of the tissue archive nor did they put the proposal out for competitive bidding before licensing it to single company in exchange for sharing its voluminous database memorial sloan kettering received ownership shares amounting to about nine percent in the company
xe cit just seems awfully coincidental that the individuals involved happen to be people in control and influence of that asset and they ended up with an exclusive use of it xe said marcus owens washington lawyer who ran the internal revenue service division that oversees tax exempt organizations xe cit seems to create cascading series of conflicts for the operation of sloan kettering xe
the decision to license images of the patients xe tissue slides to for profit company also highlights the broader debate over the use of personal medical data ranging from genetic information to in this case images of person xe cells for research and commercial purposes
after propublica and the times began asking questions about the arrangement one of the founders xe dr david klimstra the chairman of the pathology department xe said he would divest his ownership stake
dr klimstra and another co founder dr thomas fuchs the head of the computational pathology laboratory pursued the idea for paige ai in hospital officials said dr fuchs had previously worked for nasa developing algorithms that would teach the mars rovers to navigate terrain and has said some of the same algorithms can differentiate cancerous tumors from benign ones in statement he called the ai start up the culmination of his xe clife xe work xe
universities and teaching hospitals have long sought to turn their scientific discoveries into lucrative business deals indeed cancer drugs approved by the food and drug administration originated at memorial sloan kettering but the paige ai arrangement is different because what xe being commercialized is not an invention per se but rather access to raw materials xe notes and slides xe gathered over decades
paige ai is among growing number of companies including google and microsoft that are exploring ways to use artificial intelligence to improve health care pathology has been focus because it remains time consuming error prone and often subjective process where doctors examine tissue slides to decide whether cancer is present and which type other start ups in the field include pathai based in boston and spintellx which is working in partnership with the university of pittsburgh
the paige ai project finally took off after enlisting the help of norman selby member of the hospital board xe executive committee and longtime health care consultant manager and investor he is listed as founder and executive chairman of paige ai and holds an equity stake
jim breyer the early facebook investor and venture capitalist also agreed to invest at new york times conference in february on artificial intelligence he said paige xe goal would be xe cto provide predictive data and help to cancer physicians around the country xe as second opinions in many cases as well because not everyone of course has access to sloan kettering xe
the three other hospital board members who became investors are stanley druckenmiller alexander robertson and marie jos xc xa kravis according to richard beattie honorary chairman of the cancer center xe board and member of its executive committee xe cwe were desperate xe he said in an interview xe cthis is more risky than most transactions and we couldn xe find investors xe
the board investors in paige ai and mr breyer either declined to comment or did not return calls and emails mr selby has pledged to donate some of his profits to the hospital mr beattie said
experts in nonprofit law and corporate governance questioned whether memorial sloan kettering which is charity acted properly in what is known as related party transaction with the founders of paige ai
while federal law does not specifically require seeking bids from competitors or independent appraisals of the assets in such transaction nonprofit groups that make deals with companies associated with board members or employees must demonstrate that they have taken steps to ensure that insiders don xe get preferential treatment if nonprofits are found not to have complied they or the individuals involved could face tax repercussions
mr beattie said the hospital relied on some investors to set value for licensing the slides with guidance from hedge fund leaders on its board law firm which he did not identify evaluated the documents and said it was good deal
nell minow vice chair of valueedge advisors who has written books about corporate governance said the center xe process was xe cinadequate xe
xe cthey could be throwing dart at the wall to figure out what the valuation is xe she said xe cthey xe re accepting somebody xe word for it and that xe very very risky xe
mr beattie said the cancer center would follow rules requiring it to list the transaction on financial forms which won xe be public until next year he also said the hospital had set up plans to manage conflicts for the three company founders all four members who are invested including mr selby must recuse themselves from any board actions about the company mr beattie said review of the hospital xe filings does not show any similar transactions in recent years
in two meetings this month staff pathologists confronted hospital leaders over the cancer center xe relationship with paige ai some of them angered by the deal that would allow others to profit from their work
at tense meeting sept some pathologists said they only learned about the deal online after it was announced two people in attendance said
as for how the deal came about dr klimstra told colleagues that google had twice approached the hospital about securing access to the pathology slides and was turned down mr beattie said there were never serious conversations with google spokeswoman for google declined to comment
doctors also expressed concerns about whether patients had consented to have images of their tissue used in this way
dr klimstra told them the project had been approved by an institutional review board which considers ethical issues involving patients patients who had not given their consent to having their readings shared would have all personal health information stripped from the images and notes he said dr raskin said that between to percent of patients typically do not consent
and paige ai will not have exclusive access to slides that resulted from federally funded research he added
alexander capron professor who teaches medical ethics at the university of southern california said courts have generally ruled against patients in disputes over ownership of human tissue but that institutions should be as transparent as possible with patients
internal concerns about the deal and how patients would perceive it escalated after dr klimstra wrote an email in august informing the pathology staff of his involvement it elicited mocking response from dr marc rosenblum neuropathologist and former chairman of the department who suggested in reply that the center was auctioning its expertise to the highest bidder the email included tongue in cheek fight song xe cto paige pledge my self entire and promise to be true xe he wrote in the email xe ci had thing for msk but now that thing is through xe
it then says xe contemplate consulting fees repeat with feeling xe
in an interview last week dr rosenblum said he wasn xe seeking financial compensation but felt xe cthe leadership had not been particularly transparent with us about the founding of this company and feel that we were not sufficiently credited with what had been our intellectual input in this xe
kathryn martin the hospital xe chief operating officer said the cancer center did not anticipate the pathologists xe objections xe ci think we could have done better job communicating it xe she said in an interview
dr klimstra said in statement that the project represented xe cquantum leap xe in the pathology field
xe cother than my family there is nothing more important to me than running my department xe he said and added xe ci sincerely regret the fact that my equity ownership in paige has served as distraction to my primary leadership role at xe
dr fuchs the head of the computational pathology lab defended his role in separate statement xe ccomputer scientists like myself very seldom get the chance to really help patients xe he said
details for distributing any profits or proceeds from paige ai have not been worked out officials said ms martin suggested that if the deal is successful some funds could be set aside for the pathology department to finance research projects
for now much of the talk is theoretical xe the company is years away from selling finished product with staff of fewer than employees
the roster of other key advisers also appears to be in flux until recently dr baselga was listed as the chairman of paige xe scientific advisory board but his name disappeared from the company xe website last week the day after he resigned from memorial sloan kettering he also recently resigned from board positions at the pharmaceutical company bristol myers squibb and varian medical systems radiation equipment manufacturer

dallas xe whether they are trying to keep their year old playmaker jose juan barea spry or aiming to help their year old phenom luka doncic dodge the infamous rookie wall the dallas mavericks turn to the same resource blood test
it is not just any blood test the mavericks import frequent testing from the irish company orreco which is in its third season making personalized recommendations for mavericks players regarding athletic workloads and diets largely through the study of blood analysis
although some in the sports medicine community have questioned whether the value of such blood work is overstated dallas leans heavily on orreco xe team of consultants and their assessments of how to maximize player readiness
xe call the things teams talk about xe players xe minutes their load their tracking data their camera data xe all of that is external data used to try to predict what xe going on internally xe said casey smith the head of dallas xe athletic training staff xe cwhat we xe re doing is trying to get little bit of look at what xe actually going on internally xe
dallas is one of just two teams along with the knicks to hire orreco which proposes customized remedies to combat fatigue and tries to identify increased risk for injury and illness by obtaining range of data from players xe blood and feeding it into machine learning programs
taking cues from orreco xe findings smith and jeremy holsopple the mavericks xe athletic performance director tailor an individualized mix of training rest and recovery for each of dallas xe players the mavericks owner mark cuban said the team pays orreco nearly per year
no maverick has embraced this process more than barea who understands all too well that fatigued players face an increased risk of soft tissue injuries
two seasons ago amid worrisome forecasts from what smith referred to as xe cthe numbers xe barea tore calf muscle in november game against boston
ever since barea has proactively sought updates on his levels of oxidative stress worrisome as they get higher and white blood cell counts which can indicate illness or infection when they spike or indicate less immune prevention as they get lower
this season barea is playing some of his best basketball averaging points and assists in just minutes per game and said he is xe chaving more fun than ever xe while carefully adhering to the suggestions smith gives based off orreco xe data
xe ci like it xe barea said xe cat this point in my career you have to work more on the body they let me know what xe going on xe like what you need to eat or what you need to stop eating want the feedback xe
four times season orreco staff members come to dallas to administer full venous blood draw on mavericks players to supplement those visits dallas mixes in frequent capillary blood draws for its players in which quick pinprick sample is taken to provide near instant readings of oxidative stress levels in the blood from player xe ear or index finger
league rules allow players to refuse any blood testing if they find the procedures too invasive but the team says only one maverick whom they declined to identify had done so
xe cit xe your health so it xe your decision xe smith said
the samples according to the orreco co founder dr brian moore enable the firm to analyze player xe hematology and biochemistry by assessing nearly biomarkers
this includes examining creatine kinase to assess muscle damage and high sensitivity reactive protein to measure inflammation xe two areas of particular concern for basketball players because of the nature of their on court movements hydration and nutrition indicators xe such as vitamin levels and iron and fatty acid profiles xe are among the additional variables analyzed to determine where each player lands on four zone xe creadiness to perform xe index
along with the biomarker panels orreco xe algorithms also take into account game minutes air miles traveled sleep data and reaction times that are obtained from wearable devices used during practices
the rules that allow players to opt out of blood testing are in place because regulating how teams use biometrics and the data such research produces xe specifically whether the data belongs to the teams players or the league itself xe remains an evolving point of concern throughout the as safeguard amid the rise of wearable technology in practice sessions league policy threatens fines of up to per team for the misuse of biometric data
yet smith insists that the collaboration with orreco has improved the mavericks xe ability to track the onset of illness and keep players xe cmore available xe for games in the season according to data maintained by instreetclothes com website that tracks injuries in the dallas players missed only four games due to illness xe less than half the league average of
the mavericks then lost league low zero games to illness last season when the league average was games per team according to the site
xe cdoes that mean we win more games xe smith said xe cnot necessarily but it gives us better shot xe
still with the sports and fitness world littered with treatments not supported by vetted published studies some independent experts have their doubts
dr anthony romeo the chief of orthopedics at the rothman institute in new york and former team physician for the chicago white sox who also worked with the chicago bulls said he would maintain xe ca healthy level of skepticism xe about orreco xe work until it reveals more about the biomarkers it studies and the data being gathered
xe di would be cautious and say it xe investigational xe romeo said xe cit xe very interesting area of research and we applaud the efforts that they xe re making but at this time nothing supplants outstanding coaches and trainers that can do visual analysis and understand their athletes from the traditional methods to know whether they xe re training too hard or too little xe
xe cat some point xe romeo said of orreco xe cthey xe re going to have to share their data in way that it can be repeated so that we know it xe true xe
said dr robert dimeff team physician for the dallas stars of the and past president of the american medical society for sports medicine xe ci think this is research based tool at this point in time but don xe think it xe ready for prime time what they xe re doing is something that in years from now we may say xe wow this is absolutely great information xe
xe cwe can xe say that right now but what they xe re doing is trying to put some science behind recommendations and think that xe very admirable xe
despite such skepticism cuban remains one of the biggest proponents of orreco xe work after watching an interview in which the openly data hungry cuban discussed his growing fascination with artificial intelligence moore wrote to cuban before the season with pitch that orreco could xe coptimize performance accelerate recovery and prolong careers xe by using xe chigh end computing to find patterns in the data xe
xe cour job is to help the mavericks make better decisions xe moore said
cuban was quickly sold
xe cmanaging player load is as important as understanding traditional basketball analytics xe xe cuban said xe ccausation is always more valuable that correlation xe
although the mavericks are hardly alone in embracing bioanalytics they are on very short list of top level professional sports franchises that are willing to ignore the ultra secretive norm and publicly acknowledge its work with orreco
aside from the mavericks only newcastle united of the english premier league has acknowledged being an orreco customer through person with knowledge of the contract the times confirmed that the knicks are the other team to use orreco as extensively as the mavericks
orreco also consults with handful of individual players including wilson chandler of the philadelphia ers and quincy pondexter of the san antonio spurs
the company though said it could not discuss the knicks or the two major league baseball clubs and another premier league soccer team it counts as clients
smith cited quest diagnostics xe blueprint fit as another top practitioner in the field that he suspects has an clientele and acknowledged that several of his peers within the league are aware of what dallas is doing and asking lots of questions
xe cand think there will be more xe smith said

waymo google xe autonomous vehicle spinoff wants to help you run your errands
the company said on wednesday that it had teamed up with five companies including walmart avis and autonation to offer rides in its self driving cars in the phoenix area
the partnerships hint at waymo xe plans for fusing its technology into people xe everyday lives by transporting them between their homes and stores restaurants or other nearby destinations
the company xe arrangement with walmart will allow shoppers who buy groceries online to summon waymo vehicle to shuttle them to store to pick up their orders
the new service which is set to begin this week is walmart xe latest move in an intensifying competition with amazon to dominate the grocery sector after its creation of personal shopper program and the expansion of its online grocery delivery service
walmart has also explored the use of self driving technology to support its vast distribution network pre ordering autonomous tesla trucks last year for its operations in the united states and canada
autonation which already helps waymo service its cars will offer customers having work done at one of its dealerships rides in one of the autonomous vehicles rather than in the standard loaner car avis will send waymo cars to pick up and drop off customers renting vehicles from its two locations in chandler near phoenix
ddr which owns the ahwatukee foothills towne center shopping complex in phoenix will use waymo cars to help shoppers and people going out to eat avoid having to find empty spaces in crowded parking lots and business travelers and other guests at the element hotel in chandler can use the vehicles for local trips
waymo which has tested its autonomous technology for years across millions of miles is limiting the phoenix program to people who participated in an early rider trial the company began locally last year
participants in the trial used an app to summon waymo cars which could be used to go anywhere in the area to work to happy hour get togethers to the gym waymo said it had analyzed data from the trips and had found that many users were calling the cars to shop and run errands
the company said it planned to eventually expand the partnerships in other cities
waymo agreed in may to buy up to minivans from fiat chrysler for use in its ride hailing operations after announcing in march that it would buy as many as compact cars for the service from jaguar land rover

last summer china unveiled plan to become the world xe leader in artificial intelligence challenging the longtime role of the united states

san francisco xe in july china unveiled plan to become the world leader in artificial intelligence and create an industry worth billion to its economy by
to technologists working on in the united states the statement which was pages long in its english translation was direct challenge to america xe lead in arguably the most important tech research to come along in decades it outlined the chinese government xe aggressive plan to treat like the country xe own version of the apollo lunar mission xe an all in effort that could stoke national pride and spark agenda setting technology breakthroughs
the manifesto was also remarkably similar to several reports on the future of artificial intelligence released by the obama administration at the end of
xe cit is remarkable to see how has emerged as top priority for the chinese leadership and how quickly things have been set into motion xe said elsa kania an adjunct fellow at the center for new american security who helped translate the manifesto and follows china xe work on artificial intelligence xe cthe plans and policies released in were seemingly the impetus for the formulation of china xe national strategy xe
but six months after china seemed to mimic that obama era road map experts in industry and academia in the united states say that the trump white house has done little to follow through on the previous administration xe economic call to arms
xe cwe are still waiting on the white house to provide some direction xe on how to respond to the competition said tim hwang who worked on policy at google and is now the director of the ethics and governance of ai initiative new organization created by the linkedin founder reid hoffman and others to fund ethical research in artificial intelligence
china xe embrace of comes at crucial time in the development of the technology and just as the lead long enjoyed by the united states has started to dwindle
for decades artificial intelligence was more fiction than science in the past few years however dramatic improvements have prompted some of the biggest companies in silicon valley and detroit xe and china xe to invest billions on everything from self driving cars to home appliances that can have conversation with human
has also become significant part of national defense policy as military leaders and ethicists debate how much autonomy we should give to weapons that can think for themselves
american companies like amazon and google have done more than anyone to turn concepts into real products but for number of reasons including concerns that the trump administration will limit the number of immigrant engineers allowed into the united states much of the critical research being done on artificial intelligence is already migrating to other countries including tech hot spots like toronto london and beijing
to china xe growing tech community driving the industry xe next big thing xe mantra of silicon valley xe is becoming tantalizing possibility
xe cthanks to the size of the market and the rapid experimentation china is going to become one of the most powerful xe if not the most powerful xe countries in the world xe said kai fu lee former microsoft and google executive who now runs prominent chinese venture capital firm dedicated to artificial intelligence
the reports were shepherded by president barack obama xe office of science and technology policy
the which has overseen science and technology activities across the federal government for more than four decades is now run by the deputy chief technology officer michael kratsios he had worked as wall street analyst before serving as chief of staff for an investment fund run by peter thiel venture capitalist who supported mr trump xe presidential run the administration has yet to name an office director or fill four other assistant posts
in recent interview mr kratsios was adamant that any concerns over the administration xe approach to were unfounded
xe cartificial intelligence has been priority for the trump administration since day xe he said mr kratsios added that the administration was particularly concerned with the development of in national security and as way of encouraging economic prosperity
many staff members in mr kratsios xe office are exploring issues related to artificial intelligence he said mr kratsios also meets with committee set up by the obama administration that coordinates policy across the government
xe cthe key thing to remember is that the front line of policy is at the agencies xe he said xe cthe white house is convener and coordinator xe
in an echo of plans laid out by the obama administration china xe government said it intended to significantly increase long term funding for research and develop much larger community of researchers
there are several ways to do that according to the obama administration and china first educate more students in these technologies second recruit experts from other countries
at the same time both policy statements urged companies to share more technology and data huge pools of data are need to xe ctrain xe systems and in the united states much of this is locked up inside companies like facebook and google mr lee said china already has an enormous advantage here because its large population will generate more data and its companies are more willing to share
artificial intelligence has been focus of chinese technologists for some time by china was already producing more research papers than the united states in the area of xe cdeep learning xe the main technology driving the rise of according to the obama reports deep learning which allows machines to learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data is one of the main technologies driving the rise of artificial intelligence
it is unclear how much china as whole is spending but one chinese state has promised to invest billion in and the government of beijing has committed billion to an development park in the city south korea has set aside close to billion of its own canada already home to many of the top researchers in the field has also committed million to in part attract new talent from other countries
it is also difficult to say just how much the government of the united states is spending government organizations like the intelligence advanced research projects activity the national institute of standards and technology and the national science foundation continue to fund new research in universities and the private sector according to an report the federal government spent about billion year in the trump administration says that spending jumped to billion in but the current administration said that was not an apples to apples comparison to the tally because it was not certain how the obama administration made it calculations
xe cwe may have bunch of small initiatives inside the government that are doing good but we don xe have central national strategy xe said jack clark former journalist who now oversees policy efforts at openai the artificial intelligence lab co founded by elon musk tesla xe chief executive xe cit is confusing that we have this technology of such obvious power and merit and we are not hearing full throated support including financial support xe
the trump administration xe budget for aims to cut science and technology research funding across the government by percent according to report from the american association for the advancement of science
xe cthey are headed in precisely the wrong direction xe said thomas kalil who led xe technology and innovation division under president obama xe cthat is particularly concerning given that china has identified this as strategic priority xe
over the past five years much of the progress in technology has been led by american companies like google microsoft amazon and facebook but these companies don xe need technologists to work in the united states in order to employ them
take geoffrey hinton major figure in the rise of at google and across the tech industry he recently moved back to toronto where he was professor for many years he now runs new google lab in that city last year he took on an iranian researcher who was denied visa by the united states government
google operates another important lab in montreal its london lab deepmind may be home to more top notch researchers than any other lab on earth and google recently unveiled new labs in both paris and beijing facebook after creating its own lab in canada recently pumped million euros or more than million into its existing operation in paris and amazon is opening lab in germany
inside these facilities researchers still create technology for their american employers as the labs grow and the products get better some employees can be expected to leave to start their own companies and hire their own employees
google xe and microsoft xe work in china has already led to chinese start ups like malong which is building image recognition systems and major investment fund run by mr lee
xe cwhen it is close to you something like microsoft research has real economic value xe said mr clark of openai

at the start of this piece we employed two mnemonic strategies to remember the seven digits of phone number the first called the xe major system xe was developed in by historian johann winkelmann
in his book xe cmoonwalking with einstein xe the author joshua foer described this system as simple cipher that transforms numbers to letters or phonetic sounds from there we can craft words and ultimately images some will no doubt be crude or enigmatic others may contain misspellings and factual errors it doesn xe matter this system is designed to create rich imagery not accurate representations
the number for example is tp tb dp or db from those two letter combinations there are host of visuals we can come up with to match words like oilet aper erculosis epper or step our visuals followed the same logic mn nesota mm amp sh sh iba inu sk oc
one could argue that on its own the major system is as complicated as just remembering the seven digit phone number or perhaps more than that xe why you xe ll often see memory athletes combine the system with another mnemonic like the xe method of loci xe or mol
the method was first developed in ancient greece but popularized in xe cthe art of memory xe by frances yates in also called xe cmemory palace xe mol involves placing items throughout familiar place in this case your home mr foer in his book suggested walking through the front door and then letting your eyes gaze from left to right top to bottom in our example we started with map placed plush figure below it and then dog with pair of socks in its mouth
seven digits though is child xe play gary shang once used mol to memorize pi to digits
in an evolutionary sense our memory hasn xe quite become powerhouse for nonvisual information early hominids had little need to remember dates or phone numbers they did however require an acute sense of what times of the year were best to plant crops what flora were edible and when they might need to pack up and move to keep pace with nomadic food sources
xe cfrom an evolutionary prioritization perspective think most of this comes down to gating mechanisms we have in place for denoting and xe tagging xe incoming stimuli as important for the continuation of our existence xe nicco reggente ph cognitive neuroscientist at the tiny blue dot foundation said
even today sensory representations drive memory in ways mere memorization can xe touch dr reggente explained that this is best seen in the hippocampus part of the brain that originally evolved to support movement xe cin order for this movement to be purposeful it must be guided via prediction xe he said xe cit is the same region that is now in our modern age repurposed for non spatial non movement based memories as well xe
it xe why visual mnemonics like mol are so effective we xe re piggybacking on cognitive system that was fine tuned over millions of years to work best with visual and spatial representation xe cvisualization is typically beneficial due to its translation of the abstract form of the object or concept into spatial medium xe dr reggente said
names are actually best remembered by focusing on the text as it xe spoken and then using it immediately xe cthe most useful trick isn xe trick at all xe mr mullen the memory champion noted xe cit xe focus xe
as mnemonics go all the experts we spoke with suggested the same technique for remembering names it involves singling out particular trait of the person you xe re speaking with for mr mullen in made up example that was hair color the trait most noticeable about xe ckaren xe was her orange hair about the same shade as carrot he xe then imagine karen with carrots for hair perhaps munching on them as they spoke
in the psychology world there xe strange example of how these tricks work called the xe cbaker baker paradox xe after showing subjects the same photograph of man xe face the researchers tell half the participants his surname baker and the other half his occupation baker days later the subjects were more likely to remember the man xe occupation than his name this plays to the sensory nature of memory upon hearing the man was baker the brain immediately springs into action creating or recalling vast neural networks of what we xe ve associated with the title fresh bread white hat and apron or perhaps someone standing in front of patisserie greeting children with delicious sweets
when incomplete this sensation is also responsible for the tip of your tongue feeling where you can xe quite recall memory according to mr foer xe cit xe likely because we xe re accessing only part of the neural network that xe contains xe the idea but not all of it xe
for competitors the major system often in conjunction with the memory palace is the most common way to remember hundreds or even thousands of numbers
in our example phone number it may have been overkill more useful trick is simple one called chunking you xe ve been using for years without even realizing
phone numbers for example come pre chunked we don xe write or recite phone numbers as single digit is more manageable when written or recited as credit card numbers are also chunked as is your social security number
mr foer detailed an acquaintance that had never formally been taught to chunk information but used the technique to remember numbers by associating them with his hobby running xe cfor example was turned into xe minutes and point seconds near world record mile time xe xe for most of us this is probably no easier than remembering the number itself but for runner it xe different story
or it xe possible to use the major system to remember smaller number combinations even without placing visual representations inside memory palace as we did above the phone number for example becomes xe cmrt pts flls xe after consulting the chart for me the oddest most memorable phrase as mr foer suggested using is xe cmr pities fools xe granted it xe misspelled but the image is highly memorable
in training like memory champion it xe really the visual that xe most important each technique we covered capitalizes on the ability to visualize memories rather than simply attempting to recall them this as our team of experts notes is an exercise in futility
there xe nothing physiologically speaking separating memory athletes from people who forget where their keys are or can xe remember what they had for breakfast this morning the difference is in the training methods and the time spent in mastering them
xe coverall xe say you definitely don xe need to be savant to have great memory xe mr mullen said xe cif you xe re sincerely engaged with few tricks up your sleeve you might surprise yourself xe

today more than half of the world xe population lives in urban areas by an additional billion people will join them in cities around the world according to the un department of economic and social affairs these additional populations threaten to overwhelm existing city infrastructures nwhether we realize it or not we are on the verge of sea change in urban life
fortunately we are developing tools that will make our cities smarter providing not only the capacity to support this new wave of urban citizens but to significantly improve their livability together the next generation wireless network internet of things iot and artificial intelligence ai are already demonstrating the potential to solve problems ranging from traffic congestion to public safety healthcare and environmental sustainability
as the global population continues to grow cities will need to adapt to support the unique needs of their citizens for coastal city like new orleans water management and resilience may be essential for city like washington traffic management may top the list
or take san diego as an example the city is deploying an intelligent iot network citywide in partnership with intel and others to optimize traffic and parking and better facilitate energy management when completed the network will include intelligent sensor nodes that are turning street lights into vision enabled connected devices
san diego didn xe install cameras just for public safety reasons it xe part of system to handle everything from traffic management and smart parking to pedestrian safety and because the system can xe clearn xe it has the potential to improve over time as computer vision and artificial intelligence progresses
more than that san diego xe smart city iot deployment is platform that will attract new investment innovative businesses and talent as cities compete globally for talent and investment smart cities will be an indispensable catalyst for economic growth and improvement in quality of life for urban citizens
in practical sense iot is already all around us xe traffic lights air quality sensors and parking meters to name few what comes next is expected to be an exponential expansion of that universe to include billions of connected devices driven by the network
the network we use today is synonymous with speed will be synonymous with intelligence the potential billions of connected devices xe cars street lights cameras utilities buildings xe will communicate at speeds to times faster than today with ultra low latency and massive capacity
pair iot and together with ai and we xe ll begin to see smart cities working quietly behind the scenes to make our streets safer people healthier and our day to day lives more efficient in short will be the flexible wireless infrastructure of the future
intel is helping cities modernize with connectivity enabling innovation in three key areas xe public safety mobility and sustainability according to recent survey of urban decision makers at the new york times cities for tomorrow conference in new orleans believe to be extremely important to the future of smart cities
as the network is deployed an ecosystem of businesses organizations and government agencies will install billions of sensors and devices for discrete purposes that when connected fulfill common mission these devices will access computing and analytical capabilities at the edge of the computing cloud to make critical real time decisions about traffic control energy and resource usage and emergency response
major cities around the world are beginning to evaluate how they can make smart cities work for them as they do it xe essential to think big while starting small cities are also using digital infrastructure to improve the efficiency and utilization of existing physical infrastructure for example more efficient traffic management can alleviate the need to build new highway rather than shoulder the cost of new construction local departments of transportation would be able to leverage connected sensors and devices to optimize traffic flow deliver actionable insights on transportation infrastructure and do better job of getting people from point to point
as urban populations around the world surge upward the challenges we face can seem daunting the good news is intel our partners and cities like san diego are building smart and connected future that will help us rise to meet them building safer healthier and more livable cities for all of us

going back at least decade cars have been targeted by hackers some who ended up working with the industry others acting maliciously but vehicles now carry far more electronic equipment and autonomous driving relying on sensors cameras and radar is on the horizon with all kinds of ripe new targets
concern that cars could be seriously hacked xe by criminals terrorists or even rogue governments xe has prompted new round of security efforts on the part of the auto industry
as far back as disgruntled former employee at texas auto center in austin used co worker xe account to log into company software used for car repossession he disabled over cars and owners who were up to date on their payments suddenly found their vehicles honking furiously and unable to start
in veteran hacker named samy kamkar built device for under that he said could find unlock and remotely start any general motors car equipped with the onstar communications system luckily mr kamkar was acting as xe cwhite hat xe and not selling his ownstar device to unscrupulous hackers
xe ci worked with to resolve that issue xe he said and that particular vulnerability is gone xe ccars are getting more secure but it xe long cycle to get the necessary new software and hardware installed xe
dan flores cybersecurity and safety spokesman confirmed the collaboration with mr kamkar xe cwe recognize the importance of the work that researchers like samy do to help advance the work in this area xe he said in an email
securing cars is big challenge which is why some companies that traditionally prefer to go it alone have teamed up to share best practices
digital threats to self driving cars according to university of michigan report xe cinclude hackers who would try to take control over or shut down vehicle criminals who could try to ransom vehicle or its passengers and thieves who would direct self driving car to relocate itself to the local chop shop xe
the average car has over million lines of computer code and some have even more than boeing according to kpmg report that complexity the report said xe ccreates real risk of cyberattack xe risk we fear many companies in the automotive industry may be underestimating xe
that view is widespread xe cfrom my perspective automakers were little surprised and caught off guard by this threat xe said doug newcomb senior industry analyst at wards intelligence xe cthey added all this connectivity but got ahead of themselves and don xe always think of the vulnerabilities that exist it xe an ongoing issue not fix it and forget it thing xe
failing to protect consumers can be costly said steve tengler principal at the consulting company kugler maag cie who has worked at ford nissan and and was senior director of connected vehicle cybersecurity at honeywell
automakers are legally bound to provide state of the art protection for their cars mr tengler said xe clegal precedents show that it xe not enough to provide product that is kind of safe xe he said xe ccompanies don xe have to put themselves out of business to provide the safest technology but they do have to work within their commercial ability xe
mr tengler said the industry was frequent target xe cevery automaker has been hacked xe every one of them xe he said xe cattacks aren xe matter of if but when and how xe
once car is out of warranty automakers are used to cutting or at least loosening their ties but hacking issues mean that protection will most likely require factory to junkyard monitoring
in fiat chrysler recalled million cars and trucks after chris valasek and charlie miller demonstrated in wired magazine article that they could remotely control jeep cherokee xe brakes radio wipers and other functions by gaining access through its uconnect infotainment system
the company declined to comment on any subsequent security changes
dr andr xc xa weimerskirch vice president for cybersecurity and functional safety at lear corporation said that automakers had made xe chuge improvements xe in recent years and that joint efforts involving the industry academia and standards organizations had also led to gains
most car hackers have been wearing those white hats with no criminal intent but imagining what could happen led to the formation of the automotive information sharing and analysis center known as auto isac most of the world xe automakers are members
faye francy the center xe executive director described the jeep episode as xe ca good wake up call for the industry xe
xe cthe hackers are smart guys very educated xe she said xe cit xe not simple to do what they did we xe re fortunate that there hasn xe been another breach but it xe not impossible xe
not impossible but still difficult ron plesco principal at kpmg cyber security services agrees that hacking into car xe driver controls requires xe ca lot of knowledge and effort xe
xe cit xe not as easy as hollywood claims it is xe he said
that xe one reason we haven xe seen more major attacks but mr plesco argues that today there isn xe much incentive for thieves since the identity information stored onboard vehicles is fairly limited
xe cbut xe he added xe cthat xe about to change as we do more purchasing through the dashboard of the car the automobile is becoming another computer that can be hacked xe
new infotainment and autonomous features are important selling points but because most consumers assume their cars are safe automakers tend to keep cybersecurity news in the background much is happening behind the curtain however some private security firms say they are signing on with major automakers to provide expert protection
xe cthere are multiple ways for hackers to get in and it xe the job of the whole industry to defend against it xe said dan sahar vice president at upstream security in israel xe cjust one hack can cost manufacturer tens of millions of dollars and that doesn xe include the brand damage and the threat is getting more serious xe
according to mr sahar xe saw more than documented automotive related cybersecurity incidents sixfold increase in just four years xe
upstream is working with xe ca handful xe of manufacturers mr sahar said xe cautomakers are focused on cybersecurity but few say they can do it on their own xe he said
upstream report extrapolates cost topping billion for breach that requires large recall the opportunity will certainly be there for criminal hackers juniper research of britain estimated in report that by some million cars would be connected to the web in some way up from million in
mr tengler of kugler maag cie said it was easy to picture the danger that hackers posed to autonomous vehicles xe potentially redirecting them as part of theft but the jeep hack proved xe cit doesn xe matter if someone is driving xe he said xe cif they can take control of the car the vulnerable technology is already there xe
thieves have stolen cars by using fairly simple electronic technology some of it freely available device that amplifies the signals from car xe remote can be used to unlock the target vehicle xe doors mr kamkar said he had built such devices from off the shelf components for approximately
xe cit xe lot simpler than people think xe he said
other devices include radio transmitter that cycles through huge numbers of possible combinations until they xe ccrack xe the target car xe key fob in that was reportedly how the soccer star david beckham xe armor plated bmw was stolen in madrid second belonging to mr beckham was also stolen
xe ccar thieves used to have crowbars now they use laptops xe said mr plesco at kpmg
jono anderson also principal at kpmg said the auto industry needed to learn from aerospace
xe cthey xe re very familiar with this kind of security xe mr anderson said xe cbut it xe new to the auto industry maybe it xe possible to hack the entertainment system in plane and get free movies but it xe virtually impossible to hack the actual communications xe

when major electronics firm started seeing strange documents being printed out remotely on more than of its smart printers late last year it frantically contacted the manufacturer to investigate
the firm nervously wondered how xe and why xe an unauthorized third party was sending documents to its printers remotely and worse it feared its entire corporate network had been breached the manufacturer immediately called in the big guns charles henderson global head of force red professional hacking team at ibm security for answers
xe cunless you believe in ghosts you get kind of concerned when your printer just starts printing stuff out that you can xe account for xe said mr henderson who declined to name the firm for privacy reasons
his team quickly identified the problem as flaw in the printer xe remote access function and patch fixed the vulnerability
finding and testing for flaws and breaches in smart devices is mr henderson xe specialty xe ci run team of hackers xe is how mr henderson describes his role then clarifying they are paid professional hackers who look for bugs glitches and malfunctions
and with demand for smart devices ranging from smart lights to outdoor sprinklers surging in mainstream america his job has gotten lot busier
xe cwe xe ve received roughly five times the number of requests for security testing of iot internet of things devices in the last year xe said mr henderson xe cgrowth has been immense over the last year to months xe
indeed the soaring popularity of smart speakers like amazon echo and google home is starting to move the xe csmart home xe into mainstream america it xe no longer just tech geeks and phone obsessed millennials who are scouring the tech universe for information on the next best gadget that lets them control lights tvs appliances door locks and even lawn sprinklers with voice command or tap on smartphone
but all of this buzz and hype are putting pressure on smart device makers to rush their gadgets into the market while demand is hot xe and sometimes this means security features take back seat said mr henderson and cyber criminals are watching
xe ccriminals rob banks because that xe where the money is xe said charles golvin senior research director at gartner research and advisory firm xe cthey xe ll commit cyber crimes because that xe where the opportunity is xe
some get crafty making mock interfaces on person xe phone that look like an iot xe interface login to steal passwords xe similar to the way thieves send fake emails to people pretending to be from credit card companies and banks
experts caution consumers to research carefully and move diligently when adding smart devices to their home network xe cif one device gets compromised it could be the same as allowing an attacker to plug into the entire network xe giving the criminal control over all devices warned mr henderson
concerns about privacy and the complexity of smart home devices are two reasons fully outfitted smart homes are not likely to happen overnight experts say
wanting xe and actually installing xe smart devices are very different scenarios with the latter requiring patience and diligent research in navigating through costly cumbersome and often time consuming process
the setup also takes time as it involves choosing brands and understanding routers hubs and wireless communications protocols like zigbee wave and bluetooth so that all of the smart devices can talk to each other
xe cif you actually want to make your house do half dozen of these things it xe lot of work xe said frank gillett vice president and principal analyst at forrester research xe cyou need people to be patient and comfortable with working through multiple steps of instruction and in my observation significant amount of the population is not comfortable or patient xe
if you own lot of different smart devices it will mean many different apps on your phone the process of opening and launching an app every time you want to control device xe or remember the exact phrases to get voice assistant to do it xe can be cumbersome and annoying
one company sevenhugs simplifies this problem
the firm xe single remote allows person to control home xe smart tv lights entertainment system and other connected devices simply by pointing the remote at them it means family members and guests can access all the smart devices without having to use personal phone or launch multiple apps said simon tchedikian founder of sevenhugs
ultimately mr tchedikian wants to streamline content as well so that someone could ask for the latest season of the xe game of thrones xe and it would pop up without having to know and specify which streaming service platform or on demand service was offering it
beside ease of use privacy and security are critical
using smart cameras can be great for remotely monitoring an aging parent or checking whether child got home from school but they could be intrusive and even risky if the system is hacked
to lower risk and security concerns experts suggest steps people should take when building smart home
first buy quality brands while some big brands like samsung are leaders in smart appliances the rest of the smart device world is fragmented with much of the innovation coming from focused start ups and midsize companies
some of the current leaders are philips hue for lights nest and ecobee for thermostats ring for doorbells and wemo for light switches and plugs
if it xe start up research the firm and make sure it has strong online presence preferably with active user groups discussing the product
xe cif they don xe have budget for an online presence then they probably don xe have budget for security xe said mr henderson
second security updates are critical xe cmost technology companies are going to have vulnerabilities xe it xe hard to get everything right xe at the start said mr henderson he recommends checking for patches or firmware updates on the company xe website to make sure it xe on top of security issues
third create strong wi fi passwords and engage two factor authentication where possible
fourth if you move into new home buy secondhand car or purchase used smart device always make sure previous owners xe accounts aren xe still connected to the hubs routers and devices
mr henderson recalls selling his smart car and buying new one from the same manufacturer when he went to enroll his new car in the auto manufacturer xe app he discovered his old account had not been deleted from his old convertible
xe cthey hadn xe revoked my access xe said mr henderson xe ci could have tracked down my old car using the gps functionality could have unlocked it honked the horn xe could have made the new owner of my old car think the car was possessed xe
also always look at all devices that are connected to your network
xe cif you xe ve got rogue devices connected to your network it xe not your network anymore it xe shared network xe said mr henderson xe cif you had access to somebody xe home hub xe and that hub had sprinkler system light switches and garage door opener connected to it you could open their garage door turn on the sprinkler systems and start flashing the lights xe
fifth consumers need to prepare for smart device xe failure xe whether it xe because of product malfunction or power or internet outage
xe cturn off power to the devices and unplug the internet and see what happens xe said mr henderson xe cbut you definitely don xe want to wait and find out that they don xe work when you xe re standing outside your home trying to get in xe
being technology it will malfunction sometimes whether it xe smart or not
xe cthings do break xe said mr golvin
finding someone to repair that new technology can be challenging xe even if it xe made by big brand
when jordan and ben feria of orange park fla purchased samsung family hub smart refrigerator in late the refrigerator portion broke down last november even though the smart features on the outside touch screen continued to work the couple took to social media and local tv station after dozens of technicians were unable to repair it when the couple contacted samsung they were told there was only one authorized technician in northeast florida who could handle the repair xe and even then the person was unable to repair it the couple wound up getting refund
samsung spokeswoman alicia clarke described the feria xe problem as xe crare experience xe and said xe cthe matter was resolved with the consumer xe and noted that the problem was related to the refrigerator xe compressor xe not with the smart technology
xe cwhile it is unfortunate that the ferias had an issue with their refrigerator the problem was limited to the unit xe compressor not any of the smart technology incorporated into the family hub xe she said
and finally in this fiercely competitive and fast changing space many smart device makers will implode xe and consumers need fallback plan in place if they do even the most promising company can go belly up without warning
lighthouse was widely hailed as trailblazer with its home cameras that offered sensors and artificial intelligence capabilities its cameras could monitor with such precision that voice command asking the app how vase got broken earlier in the day could pull up the section of video that showed the child or pet who did the deed said mr gillett of forrester
lighthouse was viewed as the future however the company abruptly closed shop in late with note on its webpage entitled xe clights out xe that read xe unfortunately we did not achieve the commercial success we were looking for and will be shutting down operations in the near future xe
xe cthis is what happens sometimes with these cool vendors who are ahead of the curve xe said mr golvin xe cbleeding edge versus leading edge xe

san francisco xe microsoft xe co founder paul allen said wednesday that he was pumping an additional million into his nonprofit computer research lab for an ambitious new effort to teach machines xe ccommon sense xe
the money for the allen institute for artificial intelligence will about double the lab xe budget over the next three years helping to fund existing research as well as the new effort called project alexandria in the years and decades to come the lab hopes to create database of fundamental knowledge that humans take for granted but machines have always lacked
xe cto make real progress in we have to overcome the big challenges in the area of common sense xe said mr allen who founded the software giant microsoft in the with bill gates
today machines can recognize nearby objects identify spoken words translate one language into another and mimic other human tasks with an accuracy that was not possible just few years ago these talents are readily apparent in the new wave of autonomous vehicles warehouse robotics smartphones and digital assistants
but these machines struggle with other basic tasks though amazon xe alexa does good job of recognizing what you say it cannot respond to anything more than basic commands and questions when confronted with heavy traffic or unexpected situations driverless cars just sit there
xe crecognizes objects but can xe explain what it sees it can xe read textbook and understand the questions in the back of the book xe said oren etzioni former university of washington professor who oversees the allen institute for artificial intelligence xe cit is devoid of common sense xe
success may require years or even decades of work xe if it comes at all others have tried to digitize common sense and the task has always proved too large
in the mid doug lenat former stanford university professor with backing from the government and several of the country xe largest tech companies started project called cyc he and his team of researchers worked to codify all the simple truths that we learn as children from xe cyou can xe be in two places at the same time xe to xe cwhen drinking from cup hold the open end up xe
thirty years later mr lenat and his team are still at work on this xe ccommon sense engine xe xe with no end in sight
mr allen helped fund cyc and he believes it is time to take fresh approach he said because modern technologies make it easier to build this kind of system
mr lenat welcomed the new project but he also warned of challenges cyc has burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in funding running into countless problems that were not evident when the project began he called them xe cbuzz saws xe

the chinese authorities turned to massachusetts company and prominent yale researcher as they built an enormous system of surveillance and control

beijing xe the authorities called it free health check tahir imin had his doubts
they drew blood from the year old muslim scanned his face recorded his voice and took his fingerprints they didn xe bother to check his heart or kidneys and they rebuffed his request to see the results
xe cthey said xe you don xe have the right to ask about this xe xe mr imin said xe xe if you want to ask more xe they said xe you can go to the police xe xe
mr imin was one of millions of people caught up in vast chinese campaign of surveillance and oppression to give it teeth the chinese authorities are collecting dna xe and they got unlikely corporate and academic help from the united states to do it
china wants to make the country xe uighurs predominantly muslim ethnic group more subservient to the communist party it has detained up to million people in what china calls xe cre education xe camps drawing condemnation from human rights groups and threat of sanctions from the trump administration
collecting genetic material is key part of china xe campaign according to human rights groups and uighur activists they say comprehensive dna database could be used to chase down any uighurs who resist conforming to the campaign
police forces in the united states and elsewhere use genetic material from family members to find suspects and solve crimes chinese officials who are building broad nationwide database of dna samples have cited the crime fighting benefits of china xe own genetic studies
to bolster their dna capabilities scientists affiliated with china xe police used equipment made by thermo fisher massachusetts company for comparison with uighur dna they also relied on genetic material from people around the world that was provided by kenneth kidd prominent yale university geneticist
on wednesday thermo fisher said it would no longer sell its equipment in xinjiang the part of china where the campaign to track uighurs is mostly taking place the company said separately in an earlier statement to the new york times that it was working with american officials to figure out how its technology was being used
dr kidd said he had been unaware of how his material and know how were being used he said he believed chinese scientists were acting within scientific norms that require informed consent by dna donors
china xe campaign poses direct challenge to the scientific community and the way it makes cutting edge knowledge publicly available the campaign relies in part on public dna databases and commercial technology much of it made or managed in the united states in turn chinese scientists have contributed uighur dna samples to global database potentially violating scientific norms of consent
cooperation from the global scientific community xe clegitimizes this type of genetic surveillance xe said mark munsterhjelm an assistant professor at the university of windsor in ontario who has closely tracked the use of american technology in xinjiang
in xinjiang in northwestern china the program was known as xe cphysicals for all xe
from to nearly million people took part in it according to xinhua china xe official news agency the authorities collected dna samples images of irises and other personal data according to uighurs and human rights groups it is unclear whether some residents participated more than once xe xinjiang has population of about million
in statement the xinjiang government denied that it collects dna samples as part of the free medical checkups it said the dna machines that were bought by the xinjiang authorities were for xe cinternal use xe
china has for decades maintained an iron grip in xinjiang in recent years it has blamed uighurs for series of terrorist attacks in xinjiang and elsewhere in china including incident in which driver struck two people in tiananmen square in beijing
in late the communist party embarked on campaign to turn the uighurs and other largely muslim minority groups into loyal supporters the government locked up hundreds of thousands of them in what it called job training camps touted as way to escape poverty backwardness and radical islam it also began to take dna samples
in at least some of the cases people didn xe give up their genetic material voluntarily to mobilize uighurs for the free medical checkups police and local cadres called or sent them text messages telling them the checkups were required according to uighurs interviewed by the times
xe cthere was pretty strong coercive element to it xe said darren byler an anthropologist at the university of washington who studies the plight of the uighurs xe cthey had no choice xe
kenneth kidd first visited china in and remained curious about the country so when he received an invitation in for an expenses paid trip to visit beijing he said yes
dr kidd is major figure in the genetics field the year old yale professor has helped to make dna evidence more acceptable in american courts
his chinese hosts had their own background in law enforcement they were scientists from the ministry of public security xe essentially china xe police
during that trip dr kidd met li caixia the chief forensic physician of the ministry xe institute of forensic science the relationship deepened in december dr li arrived at dr kidd xe lab for an month stint she took some dna samples back to china
xe ci had thought we were sharing samples for collaborative research xe said dr kidd
dr kidd is not the only prominent foreign geneticist to have worked with the chinese authorities bruce budowle professor at the university of north texas says in his online biography that he xe chas served or is serving xe as member of an academic committee at the ministry xe institute of forensic science
jeff carlton university spokesman said in statement that professor budowle xe role with the ministry was xe conly symbolic in nature xe and that he had xe cdone no work on its behalf xe
xe cdr budowle and his team abhor the use of dna technology to persecute ethnic or religious groups xe mr carlton said in the statement xe ctheir work focuses on criminal investigations and combating human trafficking to serve humanity xe
dr kidd xe data became part of china xe dna drive
in ministry researchers published paper describing way for scientists to tell one ethnic group from another it cited as an example the ability to distinguish uighurs from indians the authors said they used dna samples taken from uighurs in china and samples from other ethnic groups from dr kidd xe yale lab
in patent applications filed in china in and ministry researchers described ways to sort people by ethnicity by screening their genetic makeup they took genetic material from uighurs and compared it with dna from other ethnic groups in the filing researchers explained that their system would help in xe cinferring the geographical origin from the dna of suspects at crime scenes xe
for outside comparisons they used dna samples provided by dr kidd xe lab the filing said they also used samples from the genomes project public catalog of genes from around the world
paul flicek member of the steering committee of the genomes project said that its data was unrestricted and that xe cthere is no obvious problem xe if it was being used as way to determine where dna sample came from
the data flow also went the other way
chinese government researchers contributed the data of uighurs to the allele frequency database an online search platform run by dr kidd that was partly funded by the united states department of justice until last year the database known as alfred contains dna data from more than populations around the world
this sharing of data could violate scientific norms of informed consent because it is not clear whether the uighurs volunteered their dna samples to the chinese authorities said arthur caplan the founding head of the division of medical ethics at new york university xe school of medicine he said that xe cno one should be in database without express consent xe
xe chonestly there xe been kind of na xc xafvet xc xa on the part of american scientists presuming that other people will follow the same rules and standards wherever they come from xe dr caplan said
dr kidd said he was xe cnot particularly happy xe that the ministry had cited him in its patents saying his data shouldn xe be used in ways that could allow people or institutions to potentially profit from it if the chinese authorities used data they got from their earlier collaborations with him he added there is little he can do to stop them
he said he was unaware of the filings until he was contacted by the times
dr kidd also said he considered his collaboration with the ministry to be no different from his work with police and forensics labs elsewhere he said governments should have access to data about minorities not just the dominant ethnic group in order to have an accurate picture of the whole population
as for the consent issue he said the burden of meeting that standard lay with the chinese researchers though he said reports about what uighurs are subjected to in china raised some difficult questions
xe ci would assume they had appropriate informed consent on the samples xe he said xe cthough must say what xe ve been hearing in the news recently about the treatment of the uighurs raises concerns xe
in dr kidd and dr budowle spoke at genomics conference in the chinese city of xi xe an it was underwritten in part by thermo fisher company that has come under intense criticism for its equipment sales in china and illumina san diego company that makes gene sequencing instruments illumina did not respond to requests for comment
china is ramping up spending on health care and research the chinese market for gene sequencing equipment and other technologies was worth billion in and could more than double in five years according to ccid consulting research firm but the chinese market is loosely regulated and it isn xe always clear where the equipment goes or to what uses it is put
thermo fisher sells everything from lab instruments to forensic dna testing kits to dna mapping machines which help scientists decipher person xe ethnicity and identify diseases to which he or she is particularly vulnerable china accounted for percent of thermo fisher xe billion in revenue according to the company xe annual report and it employs nearly people there
xe cour greatest success story in emerging markets continues to be china xe it said in the report
china used thermo fisher xe equipment to map the genes of its people according to five ministry of public security patent filings
the company has also sold equipment directly to the authorities in xinjiang where the campaign to control the uighurs has been most intense at least some of the equipment was intended for use by the police according to procurement documents the authorities there said in the documents that the machines were important for dna inspections in criminal cases and had xe cno substitutes in china xe
in february six ministry researchers credited thermo fisher xe applied biosystems brand as well as other companies with helping to analyze the dna samples of han uighur and tibetan people in china according to patent filing the researchers said understanding how to differentiate between such dna samples was necessary for fighting terrorism xe cbecause these cases were becoming more difficult to crack xe
the researchers said they had obtained uighur dna samples some of which were given to them by the police other samples were provided by uighurs voluntarily they said
thermo fisher was criticized by senator marco rubio republican of florida and others who asked the commerce department to prohibit american companies from selling technology to china that could be used for purposes of surveillance and tracking
on wednesday thermo fisher said it would stop selling its equipment in xinjiang decision it said was xe cconsistent with thermo fisher xe values ethics code and policies xe
xe cas the world leader in serving science we recognize the importance of considering how our products and services are used xe or may be used xe by our customers xe it said
human rights groups praised thermo fisher xe move still they said equipment and information flows into china should be better monitored to make sure the authorities elsewhere don xe send them to xinjiang
xe cit xe an important step and one hopes that they apply the language in their own statement to commercial activity across china and that other companies are assessing their sales and operations especially in xinjiang xe said sophie richardson the china director of human rights watch
american lawmakers and officials are taking hard look at the situation in xinjiang the trump administration is considering sanctions against chinese officials and companies over china xe treatment of the uighurs
china xe tracking campaign unnerved people like tahir hamut in may the police in the city of urumqi in xinjiang drew the year old uighur xe blood took his fingerprints recorded his voice and took scan of his face he was called back month later for what he was told was free health check at local clinic
mr hamut filmmaker who is now living in virginia said he saw between to uighurs in line he said it was absurd to think that such frightened people had consented to submit their dna
xe cno one in this situation not under this much pressure and facing such personal danger would agree to give their blood samples for research xe mr hamut said xe cit xe just inconceivable xe

as amazon dances through courtship rituals with the cities hoping to host its second headquarters the company is also charging ahead on slate of other real estate projects
this week the commerce giant announced significant expansion of its offices in boston and vancouver british columbia planning for total of new tech jobs earlier in april it said it would open its fourth fulfillment center in nevada bringing more than jobs to north las vegas in march it revealed plans to build its first such facility in missouri
xe cthey xe ve been on pretty blistering pace getting lot of space everywhere xe said greg melich an analyst with moffettnathanson
building research and development centers to support new technology while also enlarging its vast network of distribution centers has increased amazon xe capital expenditures so that they now roughly equal walmart xe mr melich said
in boston amazon confirmed on tuesday that it would move into square feet in ws development xe seaport project bringing jobs in machine learning speech science cloud computing and robotics engineering that will double its technology work force in the metropolitan area
the emphasis on speech science is sign that amazon is betting that its alexa digital assistant is at the vanguard of voice based commerce form of shopping that mr melich said was poised to grow at rapid clip the way mobile buying did several years ago
boston is one of the finalists in the heated competition to lure amazon xe new headquarters known as hq the project promises up to new jobs and more than billion in investment xe but has also raised concerns about rising property prices and intensifying urban congestion
it was not clear if amazon xe investment in the boston seaport project offered any clues to the city xe chances of landing hq the company is expected to announce its selection this year
xe ceveryone wants the cake which is the headquarters but if not they xe ll take the icing xe said dennis frenchman professor of urban design and planning at the massachusetts institute of technology
boston officials approved million in property tax incentives over years for amazon to occupy its seaport offices and have dangled another million in breaks if the company agrees to more local expansion and job creation
on monday in vancouver the canadian prime minister justin trudeau helped amazon announce new square foot office to open in at the post site redeveloped by the quadreal property group
the facility will add tech jobs to amazon xe current head count in the area
vancouver did not land on amazon xe short list of possible headquarters locations but it is three hour drive from seattle where amazon is based and short flight from the california tech centers where amazon likes to recruit employees
vancouver has also drawn attention from microsoft which is based across the border in washington state
microsoft helped back the creation of direct seaplane service between seattle and vancouver that began last week the company said in september that it would pitch in to supplement in washington state funding for study of how to link the pacific northwest to vancouver via high speed rail

google is holding its annual conference for developers near its mountain view calif headquarters this week the event open on tuesday with keynote speech by sundar pichai google xe chief executive who is expected to talk about its latest efforts around artificial intelligence xe technology that the company believes will be instrumental to its future
the conference comes as google faces growing backlash against its vast data collection practices in the wake of facebook xe scandal involving cambridge analytica dai wakabayashi
one of the other centers of gravity in the technology industry microsoft will hold its own technical conference for developers build in seattle through wednesday
there was time no company was better at rallying developers to write software for its underlying technologies xe the windows operating system in microsoft xe case but over the past decade lot of developer activity has shifted to mobile technologies from apple and google
build is expected to showcase variety of microsoft initiatives that have helped the company maintain its influence in the tech industry including its azure cloud computing service and tools for adding artificial intelligence to software nick wingfield

the bank of england britain xe central bank faces tricky balancing act when its rate setting committee meets on thursday with inflation still sharply above the bank xe target traders had been betting that policymakers would raise the benchmark interest rate
but recent run of poor economic data xe including disappointing growth figures and worse than anticipated results in the manufacturing sector xe has prompted traders to revise those expectations mark carney the bank xe governor has also played down the possibility of rate increase prashant rao
friday xe jobs report showed that the unemployment rate fell below percent for the first time since that xe good news for workers but it may add to fears that the tightening labor market will lead to faster inflation data that is to be released by the labor department on thursday could add more fuel to the fire
economists expect the report to show that consumer prices rose percent in april and were up percent from year earlier which would mark the fastest growth in more than year that acceleration would partly reflect higher oil prices but inflation most likely picked up even setting aside volatile food and energy prices
the federal reserve has already factored somewhat faster inflation into its forecasts but an unexpected spike could force the central bank to raise interest rates more quickly than planned ben casselman

the woman in the photo seems familiar
she looks like jennifer aniston the xe cfriends xe actress or selena gomez the child star turned pop singer but not exactly
she appears to be celebrity one of the beautiful people photographed outside movie premiere or an awards show and yet you cannot quite place her
that xe because she xe not real she was created by machine
the image is one of the faux celebrity photos generated by software under development at nvidia the big name computer chip maker that is investing heavily in research involving artificial intelligence
at lab in finland small team of nvidia researchers recently built system that can analyze thousands of real celebrity snapshots recognize common patterns and create new images that look much the same xe but are still little different the system can also generate realistic images of horses buses bicycles plants and many other common objects
the project is part of vast and varied effort to build technology that can automatically generate convincing images xe or alter existing images in equally convincing ways the hope is that this technology can significantly accelerate and improve the creation of computer interfaces games movies and other media eventually allowing software to create realistic imagery in moments rather than the hours xe if not days xe it can now take human developers
in recent years thanks to breed of algorithm that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data companies like google and facebook have built systems that can recognize faces and common objects with an accuracy that rivals the human eye now these and other companies alongside many of the world xe top academic labs are using similar methods to both recognize and create
nvidia images can match the resolution of images produced by top of the line camera but when viewed on even the largest smartphones they are sharp detailed and in many cases remarkably convincing
for example look at the two photos below and see if you can figure out which person is real
this one is computer generated
this one is also computer generated
xe sorry this was trick question both images were generated by computers
like other prominent researchers the nvidia team believes the techniques that drive this project will continue to improve in the months and years to come generating significantly larger and more complex images
xe cwe think we can push this further generating not just photos but images that can be used in computer games and films xe said jaakko lehtinen one of the researchers behind the project
today many systems generate images and sounds using complex algorithm called neural network this is way of identifying patterns in large amounts of data by identifying common patterns in thousands of car photos for instance neural network can learn to identify car but it can also work in the other direction it can use those patterns to generate its own car photos
as it built system that generates new celebrity faces the nvidia team went step further in an effort to make them far more believable it set up two neural networks xe one that generated the images and another that tried to determine whether those images were real or fake these are called generative adversarial networks or gans in essence one system does its best to fool the other xe and the other does its best not to be fooled
xe cthe computer learns to generate these images by playing cat and mouse game against itself xe said mr lehtinen

this series of images shows the output of nvidia xe system over the course of days of processing with their method called progressive gans the nvidia researchers built system that begins with low resolution images and then gradually progresses to higher resolutions this allows the training to happen more quickly but it also in more controlled and stable way the result by pixel images that are sharp detailed and in many cases very convincing source nvidia
second team of nvidia researchers recently built system that can automatically alter street photo taken on summer xe day so that it looks like snowy winter scene researchers at the university of california berkeley have designed another that learns to convert horses into zebras and monets into van goghs deepmind london based lab owned by google is exploring technology that can generate its own videos and adobe is fashioning similar machine learning techniques with an eye toward pushing them into products like photoshop its popular image design tool
trained designers and engineers have long used technology like photoshop and other programs to build realistic images from scratch this is what movie effects houses do but it is becoming easier for machines to learn how to generate these images on their own said durk kingma researcher at openai the artificial intelligence lab founded by tesla chief executive elon musk and others who specializes in this kind of machine learning
xe cwe now have model that can generate faces that are more diverse and in some ways more realistic than what we could program by hand xe he said referring to nvidia xe work in finland
but new concerns come with the power to create this kind of imagery
with so much attention on fake media these days we could soon face an even wider range of fabricated images than we do today
xe cthe concern is that these techniques will rise to the point where it becomes very difficult to discern truth from falsity xe said tim hwang who previously oversaw policy at google and is now director of the ethics and governance of artificial intelligence fund an effort to fund ethical research xe cyou might believe that accelerates problems we already have xe
each of these images took about days for the computers to generate before reaching point that the system found them believable source nvidia
the idea of generative adversarial networks was originally developed in by researcher named ian goodfellow while he was ph student at the university of montreal he dreamed up the idea after an argument at local bar and built the first prototype that same night now mr goodfellow is researcher at google and his idea is among the most important and widely explored concepts in the rapidly accelerating world of artificial intelligence
though this kind of photo generation is currently limited to still images many researchers believe it could expand to videos games and virtual reality but mr kingma said this could take years just because it will require much larger amounts of computing power that is the primary problem that nvidia is also working on along with other chip makers
researchers are also using wide range of other machine learning techniques to edit video in more convincing xe and sometimes provocative xe ways
in august group at the university of washington made headlines when they built system that could put new words into the mouth of barack obama video others including pinscreen california start up and iflytek of china are developing similar techniques using images of president donald trump
the results are not completely convincing but the rapid progress of gans and other techniques point to future where it becomes easier for anyone to generate faux images or doctor the real thing that is cause for real concern among experts like mr hwang
eliot higgins the founder of bellingcat an organization that analyzes current events using publicly available images and video pointed out that fake images are by no means new problem in the years since the rise of photoshop the onus has been on citizens to approach what they view online with skepticism
but many of us still put certain amount of trust in photos and videos that we don xe necessarily put in text or word of mouth mr hwang believes the technology will evolve into kind of arms race pitting those trying to deceive against those trying to identify the deception
mr lehtinen downplays the effect his research will have on the spread of misinformation online but he does say that as time goes on we may have to rethink the very nature of imagery xe cwe are approaching some fundamental questions xe he said

ms buolamwini is the founder of the algorithmic justice league
when was college student using powered facial detection software for coding project the robot programmed couldn xe detect my dark skinned face had to borrow my white roommate xe face to finish the assignment later working on another project as graduate student at the media lab resorted to wearing white mask to have my presence recognized
my experience is reminder that artificial intelligence often heralded for its potential to change the world can actually reinforce bias and exclusion even when it xe used in the most well intended ways
systems are shaped by the priorities and prejudices xe conscious and unconscious xe of the people who design them phenomenon that refer to as xe the coded gaze xe research has shown that automated systems that are used to inform decisions about sentencing produce results that are biased against black people and that those used for selecting the targets of online advertising can discriminate based on race and gender
specifically when it comes to algorithmic bias in facial analysis technology xe my area of research and one focus of my work with the algorithmic justice league xe google xe photo application labeling black people in images as xe cgorillas xe and facial analysis software that works well for white men but less so for everyone else are infamous examples as disturbing as they are they do not fully capture the risks of this technology that is increasingly being used in law enforcement border control school surveillance and hiring
the products of company called hirevue which are used by over companies including nike unilever and even atlanta public schools allow employers to interview job applicants on camera using to rate videos of each candidate according to verbal and nonverbal cues the company xe aim is to reduce bias in hiring
but there xe catch the system xe ratings according to business insider reporter who tested the software and discussed the results with hirevue xe chief technology officer reflect the previous preferences of hiring managers so if more white males with generally homogeneous mannerisms have been hired in the past it xe possible that algorithms will be trained to favorably rate predominantly fair skinned male candidates while penalizing women and people of color who do not exhibit the same verbal and nonverbal cues
it xe repeatedly been proven that apart from technology people tend to make hiring decisions favoring white and male candidates all other things being equal with this in mind the instinct to hand the rating of potential employees over to technology is understandable but how do we know qualified candidate whose verbal and nonverbal cues tied to age gender sexual orientation or race depart from those of the high performers used to train the algorithm will not be scored lower than similar candidate who more closely resemblesthe in group we won xe know if we do not repeatedly test the technology and its application
the tests that have been done on facial analysis technology raise concerns in collaboration with the computer vision expert timnit gebru investigated the accuracy of facial analysis technology from ibm microsoft and face on the simple task of guessing the gender of face all companies xe technology performed better on male faces than on female faces and especially struggled on the faces of dark skinned african women in the worst case the technology was percent less accurate for those women than it was for white men
given how susceptible facial analysis technology seems to recreating gender and racial bias companies using hirevue if they hope to increase fairness should check their systems to make sure it is not amplifying the biases that informed previous hiring decisions it xe possible companies using hirevue could someday face lawsuits charging that the program had negative disparate impact on women and minority applicants violation of title vii of the civil rights act
the risks of biased facial analysis technology extend beyond hiring according to the center on privacy and technology at georgetown law the faces of half of all adults in the united states xe over million people xe are currently in face recognition database networks that can be searched by police departments without warrant these searches are often reliant on facial recognition technology that hasn xe been tested for accuracy on different groups of people this matters because misidentification can subject innocent people to police scrutiny or erroneous criminal charges
in the case of south wales where big brother watch reports that between may and march the faces of over misidentified innocent people were stored by the police department without their consent the department reported false positive facial identification rate of percent but it xe important to remember that even if false positive match rates improve unfair use of facial recognition technology cannot be fixed with software patch even accurate facial recognition can be used in disturbing ways the baltimore police department used face recognition technology to identify and arrest people who attended the protests against police misconduct that followed freddie gray xe death in baltimore
we need to challenge the growing use of this technology and there has been some progress on this front the is calling on amazon to stop selling facial analysis technology to law enforcement and is contesting the use of in car facial recognition for the vehicle face system being tested at the united states mexico border though lawmakers in texas illinois and california have made legislative efforts to regulate facial recognition technology there are no federal laws yet there is blueprint report from georgetown law school proposed model federal legislation policymakers should embrace it
we can also learn from international models unlike the united states canada has federal statute governing the use of biometric data in the private sector companies like facebook and amazon must obtain informed consent to collect citizens xe unique face information in the european union article of the general data protection regulation requires express affirmative consent for collection of biometrics from citizens
everyday people should support lawmakers activists and public interest technologists in demanding transparency equity and accountability in the use of artificial intelligence that governs our lives facial recognition is increasingly penetrating our lives but there is still time to prevent it from worsening social inequalities to do that we must face the coded gaze

the internet is technology of low cost communication and connection everything from email to commerce to social networks has hinged on the internet xe transformative role in changing the economics of communication all those connections suddenly became both possible and cheap
artificial intelligence is technology of low cost prediction and discovery it exploits the new resource of the digital age xe vast amounts of data xe to identify patterns and make predictions much of what does today can be thought of as prediction what product to recommend what ad to show you what image is in that picture what move should the robot make next xe all are automated predictions
this concept of as an engine of predictive decision making is the main theme of new book by three economists at the rotman school of management at the university of toronto xe prediction machines the simple economics of artificial intelligence xe harvard business review press
the authors ajay agrawal joshua gans and avi goldfarb argue that powered decision making is poised to alter virtually every industry to explain they start with an leader amazon the online retail giant is constantly learning more and more about its customers xe buying habits and tastes and the data is steadily improving the predictive power of its algorithms
imagine the authors suggest that amazon xe gets good enough that the company takes the next step xe shipping goods before they are ordered it knows what you want so accurately that returns would be minimal and make amazon even more efficient
it would also change the nature of shopping xe cfrom an opt in experience to an opt out experience xe mr agrawal said in an interview
fanciful thought experiment perhaps but amazon was granted patent for xe canticipatory shipping xe in
just where artificial intelligence is taking us at what pace and along what trajectory is uncertain the technology of course is raising serious questions about its potential impact on jobs privacy and politics
still is marching into practically every field from agriculture to the arts here are five examples
medicine brendan frey studied under geoffrey hinton scientist and pioneer of so called deep learning an technique that has made remarkable progress in recent years on tasks like image recognition and language translation for years mr frey has done research that combines deep learning and cell biology
deep genomics founded in is at the forefront of efforts by big companies start ups and university researchers to transform the economics of drug discovery the problem is apparent it typically takes several years and costs billions of dollars for pharmaceutical companies to bring new drug to market much of the money and time is spent on clinical trials on human subjects
holds the promise of sharply reducing the amount of costly and lengthy trial and error in traditional drug development and testing deep genomics based in toronto is not only using its technology to winnow the number of target compounds to attack particular disease but also to predict the biological outcome in humans xe cthe guesswork is tremendously reduced xe mr frey said
it is still early for deep genomics and its approach the first of its compounds will be tested in clinical trials beginning in
agriculture corporate agriculture deploys an array of high tech tools including sophisticated weather modeling soil sensors genetic seed breeding and drones but there is another side to agriculture the million small farms xe two hectares or less xe that produce most of the developing world xe food
plantvillage research and development project based at penn state university is beginning to bring artificial intelligence to these smaller farms scientists at plantvillage in collaboration with international organizations local farm extension programs and engineers at google is working to tailor technology for farmers in tanzania who have inexpensive smartphones the initial focus is on cassava hearty crop that can survive droughts and barren soil but plant disease and pests can reduce crop yields by percent or more
plantvillage and international institute of tropical agriculture have developed simple assistant called nuru xe clight xe in swahili wave the phone over plant leaf and the software diagnoses the disease or pest blight and suggests low tech treatments once downloaded the app does not require wireless access to cellular data or remote computing power which means it works in rural villages
programs in kenya and india are underway in the developed nations people fear as job killer xe cbut in low income countries that lack human capital in fields like agricultural science there is an opportunity to use to help break the cycle of poverty xe said david hughes an entomologist at penn state and the director of plantvillage
heavy equipment an estimated billion people in more than countries step onto kone elevator or escalator every day its big people lifting machines are representative example of the overhaul underway in businesses that make and service heavy equipment
the finland based multinational is using ibm xe watson software to constantly monitor the performance of its machines low cost sensors wireless communications cloud computing and software are the technical ingredients that make the change possible now
kone xe new equipment is being made with the sensors and wireless links while its older models are being retrofitted data streams off each machine every second providing measurements that include vibration leveling braking temperature door openings and cargo weight
the data is fed into the software which looks for telltale signals that machine is in need of maintenance or new part before it fails xe cyou go from being reactive to proactive and predictive xe said larry wash an executive vice president of kone
the results on the elevators deploying the new technology so far are encouraging there are percent fewer breakdowns and percent fewer customer reports of problems than on elevators serviced on traditional maintenance schedules
insurance root insurance start up in columbus ohio is using artificial intelligence to more accurately price car insurance alex timm the chief executive says good drivers pay more than they should effectively subsidizing the bad driving culprits xe the one third drivers responsible for the majority of accidents
root is bet that with modern technology it can do better charging good drivers less for auto insurance up to month less xe and the start up can still be quite profitable since its insurance app was introduced in the fall of root has expanded into states to date
root uses the sensors in smartphone to measure location acceleration braking and turning the myriad sensor data is parsed by clever software for signals of risky driving behavior xe lane changing tail gating even texting typing generates tiny but measurable vibrations
potential customers download the root app and are monitored for test drive period typically two or three weeks the algorithmically vetted safe drivers are approved
xe cour models are much more accurately predictive of accidents xe mr timm said
root insists that it collects data only for its own risk analysis xe cwe xe ve never sold data and never will xe he said
art in weirdly morphing images of puppies and celebrity faces appeared in youtube videos they immediately became sensation in the digital art world not only was the hallucinogenic imagery remarkable but it was also the handiwork of google xe deep dream an program
deep dream used so called neural networks to digest millions of images identify visual patterns and then create something new xe kind of aesthetic prediction
today many computer artists are using tools to create new imagery design interactive visual experiences and probe machine intelligence their work benefits from wealth of software that is freely shared among computer scientists and artists
in his project xe experiments with deep generator networks xe gene kogan used machine learning algorithm that learned from many photos on the web which were labeled in categories like gazebo or butte and then produced its own version xe cit xe neural network imagining what gazebo or butte looks like xe said mr kogan resident scholar at new york university
computer art has been around for decades and hollywood xe digitally animated movies and special effects are marvels of rich evocative imagery but that is more comparable to computer aided design with the software serving as supercharged pencil or paintbrush still firmly controlled by the human artists
modern software is different xe cnow we xe re playing with tools that maybe xe are more akin to human perception and intelligence xe said golan levin professor of electronic art at carnegie mellon university

judging by the breathless coverage it can seem as if the only countries developing are the united states and china but while companies in those two countries are leading the way in cutting edge research and products it xe still early for the industry and other nations are working hard to become major players here are six that could challenge the two juggernauts
singapore was one of the first countries to announce national strategy called singapore in may the initiative brings the government research institutions and companies together to collaborate on research and speed up local adoption of with million to spend over five years singapore also has head start in autonomous vehicles it had the first self driving taxis for use by the public and built mini town for further testing
the united arab emirates is the first country in the middle east to publish an strategy and the only country in the world to create ministry of artificial intelligence while the emiratis are trying to attract international attention with bold projects like an powered lab focused on climate change this summer they taught local students at an camp to develop their own talent pool
israel is becoming world leader in medical with dozens of new health care start ups in country that has population just shy of new jersey xe the government announced five year program with budget of million to digitize patient data and use to gather important insights with hopes of turning the homegrown expertise into consumer products that could make israel an industry leader
india released its strategy only this summer but it contains big idea that could catch them up become the xe cgarage xe that develops that creates economic growth and social development for themselves and the rest of the developing world the plan which they are calling aiforall will focus on projects around health care agriculture education smart cities and infrastructure and smart mobility and transportation
the french government released page document earlier this year that spells out its efforts around the health environment transportation and security sectors and is putting billion into funding projects around those areas and when or if britain leaves the european union france is well placed to be the union xe epicenter of both google and facebook already have offices in paris dedicated to research
two of the four xe cgodfathers xe of the current boom yoshua bengio and geoffrey hinton live work and teach in canada their efforts have helped spur major research and an industry there including offices for uber facebook and google the current immigration restrictions in the united states have also sent talented international researchers to canada instead of silicon valley

the shift
by kevin roose
dear tech workers
long year huh
get it your industry is under siege whether you work at an established giant like facebook or google private company like uber or palantir or lesser known start up it feels like you xe re being attacked from thousand directions people are comparing your companies to big tobacco and congress is accusing your executives of undermining democracy poisoning users xe brains and censoring content
all of sudden silicon valley xe once the golden child of american industry xe has become villain
some of the backlash probably feels excessive after all the tech industry still creates useful things and employs lots of decent and ethical people but xe ve talked to number of tech workers recently and xe ve seen you wrestling with your consciences some of you have stopped wearing your company shirts around town fearing dirty looks from strangers others have taken extended vacations after particularly shameful scandal or asked for transfer within company more than few of you have had awkward conversations with your parents
here xe the thing though you don xe have to keep your concerns bottled up
you are your employers xe most valuable assets and your bosses are desperate to keep you happy as tech companies take on increasingly vital roles in global commerce and culture you have the power to shape the way they operate and the ethical standards they uphold
if you want change all you have to do is organize and speak up
in most industries rank and file workers don xe have much say the power of organized labor in america has been shrinking since the and other than few notable teachers xe strikes this year large scale collective action is rare these days
but tech is different unlike factories or airlines tech companies live and die on their ability to attract and retain top talent shortage of skilled workers has led to lucrative bidding wars tipping the balance of power in workers xe favor because many of them are attracted to altruistic missions xe and unhappy or morally conflicted workers can easily find other jobs xe executives are compelled to listen to them
xe ctech workers are the only point of leverage on these big companies xe said maciej ceg xc owski the founder of the social bookmarking service pinboard
mr ceg xc owski who has started an advocacy organization called tech solidarity said that the typical instruments used to rein in corporate misbehavior xe customer boycotts shareholder activism and outside regulation xe aren xe likely to work on the largest silicon valley companies
instead change at these companies will need to come from the inside
xe ceven couple hundred employees working in concert could bring site like google to its knees xe mr ceg xc owski said
some tech workers are already starting to flex their muscles employees from large tech companies led an effort to oppose the travel ban announced by president trump last year and employees of facebook google intel cisco and stripe attended demonstration at the headquarters of palantir to protest the company xe development of surveillance technology for federal immigration enforcers just this month more than google employees signed letter objecting to the company xe involvement in pentagon program that could use artificial intelligence to improve the accuracy of drone strikes
but these are just warm up skirmishes for maximum impact tech workers will need to scrutinize not just their employers xe government ties but their products business models and basic standards and they xe ll need to do it in public
recall what happened at uber women inside the company complained for years about the problematic behavior of travis kalanick and other company leaders but it wasn xe until susan fowler former uber engineer published her story of sexual harassment that things changed
without ms fowler xe brave disclosure xe and her colleagues xe willingness to back her up after she went public xe it xe entirely possible that mr kalanick would still be uber xe chief executive and the company would still be run by boorish bros
typically when workers speak out or organize it xe because they want higher wages better working conditions or stronger job security those aren xe your problems you probably work manageable hours in tastefully decorated buildings with free food ergonomic desk furniture and plentiful amenities your compensation is generous and you xe re in little danger of being fired or retaliated against especially if you xe re part of large group
the possibilities for you are so much greater what if facebook employees publicly took their executives to task for neglecting the real world violence their products are causing in places like myanmar and sri lanka what if google or twitter employees threatened to walk unless their executives took major action against radical extremists and hate speech what if apple employees insisted that the company stop parking billions of dollars in offshore tax shelters or amazon engineers threatened to quit unless the company paid its warehouse workers higher wages
and that xe before we even get to the thorny ethical debates surrounding technologies like artificial intelligence in which companies xe goals xe amass huge amounts of data to help train increasingly sophisticated machine learning models xe may be at odds with what xe good for society
there are few signs that washington is capable of policing the use of emerging technologies and while companies like google have formed their own ethics groups those groups are ultimately powerless if executives decide to ignore their advice
that leaves an opening for you
xe cit xe not clear where the pressure xe going to come from otherwise xe said leslie berlin stanford historian who has studied silicon valley xe labor culture
some tech workers are already making noise about unionizing and service workers at several tech companies have already joined unions but even if traditional labor unions don xe take hold in silicon valley there are still plenty of avenues for influence the tech workers coalition group of hundreds of concerned industry employees has chapters in san francisco seattle and san jose and group called tech action began meeting in new york last year the center for humane technology group of ex tech workers has been pushing for ethical product development
these groups are still small and none has produced concrete results yet but they are early signs that greater political consciousness is stirring in the industry
in tech dominated world when the decisions made by handful of silicon valley executives have the ability to reshape nations and transform billions of lives there xe no better time to stand up together you can encourage your employers to behave in ethical and humane ways and blow the whistle publicly when they fall short
organizing yourselves to push for change isn xe just viable option xe it might be the only way out of this mess
godspeed

much of the empire built by alex jones the infowars founder and social media shock jock vanished this summer when facebook suspended mr jones for days and took down four of his pages for repeatedly violating its rules against bullying and hate speech youtube apple and other companies also took action against mr jones but private infowars facebook group with more than members which had survived the crackdown remained hive of activity
in mr jones xe absence the group continued to fill with news stories infowars videos and rants about social media censorship users also posted the sort of content xe hateful attacks against muslims transgender people and other vulnerable groups xe that got mr jones suspended and last week when mr jones xe suspension expired he returned to the group triumphantly
xe cmy day facebook ban is up xe mr jones announced
mr jones built his facebook audience on pages xe the big public megaphones he used to blast links memes and videos to millions of his followers in recent months though he and other large scale purveyors of inflammatory speech have found refuge in private groups where they can speak more openly with less fear of being punished for incendiary posts
several private facebook groups devoted to qanon sprawling pro trump conspiracy theory have thousands of members regional chapters of the proud boys right wing nationalist group that twitter suspended last month for its xe cviolent extremist xe nature maintain private facebook groups which they use to vet new members and anti vaccination groups have thrived on facebook in part because they are sometimes recommended to users by the site xe search results and xe csuggested groups xe feature
facebook xe fight against disinformation and hate speech will be topic of discussion on capitol hill on wednesday when sheryl sandberg the company xe chief operating officer will join jack dorsey twitter xe chief executive to testify in front of the senate intelligence committee
when it comes to public facing pages ms sandberg will have plenty of company actions to cite facebook has taken many steps to clean up its platform including hiring thousands of additional moderators developing new artificial intelligence tools and breaking up coordinated influence operations ahead of the midterm elections
but when it comes to more private forms of communication through the company xe services xe like facebook groups or the messaging apps whatsapp and facebook messenger xe the social network xe progress is less clear some experts worry that facebook xe public cleanup may be pushing more toxic content into these private channels where it is harder to monitor and moderate
misinformation is not against facebook xe policies unless it leads to violence but many of the private groups reviewed by the new york times contained content and behavior that appeared to violate other facebook rules such as rules against targeted harassment and hate speech in one large qanon group members planned coordinated harassment campaign known as operation mayflower against public figures such as the actor michael ian black the late night host stephen colbert and the cnn journalist jim acosta in the infowars group posts about muslims and immigrants have drawn threatening comments including calls to deport castrate and kill people
xe cthey xe ve essentially empowered very large groups that can operate secretly without much governance and oversight xe said jennifer grygiel an assistant professor at syracuse university xe newhouse school of public communications xe cthere may be harms and abuses that are taking place and they can xe see xe
after the times sent screenshots to facebook of activity taking place inside these groups facebook removed several comments saying they violated the company xe policies on hate speech the groups themselves however remain active
facebook spokeswoman said the company used automated tools including machine learning algorithms to detect potentially harmful content inside private groups and flag it for human reviewers who make the final decisions about whether or not to take it down the company is developing additional ways she said to determine if an entire group violates the company xe policies and should be taken down rather than just its individual posts or members
harmful activity does not appear to be more prevalent in secret groups the facebook spokeswoman said
private groups have been core feature of facebook for years but they received new focus last year when executives changed the company xe mission to emphasize close knit connections rather than filling users xe feeds with news stories and viral videos in long memo called xe cbuilding global community xe mark zuckerberg facebook xe chief executive set out goal of connecting billion facebook users
soon after the company xe algorithms began giving posts from groups higher visibility in users xe news feeds the largest facebook groups xe such as pantsuit nation progressive political group formed to rally hillary clinton supporters in the election xe gained millions of members
facebook xe promotion of private groups encouraged like minded people to cluster together but it also meant that some users were seeing more posts from people whose opinions and interests they already shared and it may have created echo chambers where polarizing behavior could flourish
xe cit xe one of the really thorny challenges facebook faces xe said eli pariser co founder of the website upworthy and author of xe the filter bubble xe xe can easy way to bond is over common enemy how do you bond people together without actually fanning the flames of division xe
facebook groups are self regulated by members who act as administrators and moderators with the authority to remove posts and oust unruly members and the company has rolled out new features for group leaders to give them more control and help them resolve conflicts within their groups
one type of private facebook group known as xe cclosed xe group can be found through searches another type known as xe csecret xe group is invisible to all but those who receive an invitation from current member to join in both cases only members can see posts made inside the group
the private infowars group is closed was formed before facebook took action against mr jones and is billed as an xe cunofficial xe fan group new users must be approved by moderators and answer several screening questions including xe cwhat is the answer to xe the correct answer according to the title of one of mr jones xe books is xe xe
since the public infowars page was taken down the private group has functioned as makeshift home for fans of the site two remaining infowars pages along with profiles apparently belonging to mr jones and others affiliated with infowars are listed as administrators giving them higher level of control of the group than moderators
mr jones and several other administrators of the infowars group did not respond to request for comment
it xe impossible of course for facebook to prevent all bad behavior on its platforms but its choices can make it easier or harder for violent and extreme movements to gather critical mass this year after viral hoaxes on the app were implicated in spate of mob violence in india the facebook owned messaging app whatsapp limited feature that allowed users to forward messages easily to large numbers of groups
because groups provide more privacy than public pages they can also be magnets for trolls abusers and spammers last year right wing activists gathered in private facebook group republic of kekistan to organize targeted harassment campaigns including threatening transgender cartoonist and trolling fund raising page for heather heyer the woman killed in the violent xe cunite the right xe rally in charlottesville va and private facebook group for marines became embroiled in scandal last year when members of the group were discovered to have shared nude photos of female service members along with lewd comments
foreign organizations have also found private groups useful last month when facebook took down hundreds of public pages that it said were connected to coordinated influence operation with hints of russian and iranian involvement it also removed three private groups the company did not name the groups or say how they were used but it revealed that users joined at least one of them
xe cthe vast majority of groups on facebook are probably the run of the mill groups xe said ren xc xa diresta researcher with data for democracy who studies online extremism xe cthe challenge is how does the groups feature interact with the other features on facebook that we know are causing radicalization hate speech and genocide in certain places who is taking responsibility for looking at the negative externalities of this push to create communities xe

mr benson has authored five books on astronomy and planetary exploration
frankfurt germany xe it xe testament to the lasting influence of stanley kubrick and arthur clarke xe film xe space odyssey xe which turns this week that the disc shaped card commemorating the german film museum xe new exhibition on the film is wordless but instantly recognizable its face features the cyclopean red eye of the hal supercomputer nothing more needs saying
viewers will remember hal as the overseer of the giant ill fated interplanetary spacecraft discovery when asked to hide from the crew the goal of its mission to jupiter xe point made clearer in the novel version of xe xe than in the film xe hal gradually runs amok eventually killing all the astronauts except for their wily commander dave bowman in an epic showdown between man and machine dave played by keir dullea methodically lobotomizes hal even as the computer pleads for its life in terminally decelerating soliloquy
cocooned by their technology the film xe human characters appear semi automated xe component parts of their gleaming white mother ship as for hal xe conflicted artificial intelligence created to provide flawless objective information but forced to xe clive lie xe as mr clarke put it xe the computer was quickly identified by the film xe initial viewers as its most human character
this transfer of identity between maker and made is one reason xe xe retains relevance even as we put incipient artificial intelligence technologies to increasingly problematic uses
in xe xe the ghost in discovery xe machinery is consciousness engineered by human ingenuity and therefore as prone to mistakes as any human in the cartesian sense of thinking and therefore being it has achieved equality with its makers and has seen fit to dispose of them xe cthis mission xe hal informs dave xe cis too important to allow you to jeopardize it xe
asked in april whether humanity risked being xe cdehumanized xe by its technologies mr clarke replied xe cno we xe re being superhumanized by them xe while all interpretations of the film were valid he said in his view the human victory over discovery xe computer might prove pyrrhic
indeed with its prehistoric xe cdawn of man xe opening and grand finale in which dave is reborn as an eerily weightless star child xe xe overtly references nietzsche xe concept that we are but an intermediate stage between our apelike ancestors and the xc cbermensch or xe cbeyond man xe decades after nietzsche xe death the nazis deployed highly selective reading of his ideas while ignoring nietzsche xe antipathy to both anti semitism and pan german nationalism
in nietzsche xe concept the xc cbermensch is destined to rise like phoenix from the western world xe tired judeo christian dogmas to impose new values on warring humanity almost century later mr clarke implied that human evolution xe next stage could well be machine intelligence itself xe cno species exists forever why should we expect our species to be immortal xe he wrote
we have yet to engineer hal type artificial general intelligence capable of human style thought instead we xe re experiencing the incremental disruptive arrival of components of such an intelligence its semi sentient algorithms learn from text image and video without explicit supervision its automated discovery of patterns in that data is called xe cmachine learning xe
this kind of lies behind facial recognition algorithms now in use by beijing to control china xe billion inhabitants and by western societies to forestall terrorist attacks
in mr clarke xe novel hal xe aberrant behavior was attributable to contradictory programming in today xe hyperpartisan context mix of machine learning networks of malicious bots and related technologies based on simulating human thought processes are being used to manipulate the human mind xe comparatively sluggish xe cwetware xe recent revelations about stolen facebook user data being weaponized by cambridge analytica and deployed to exploit voters xe hopes and fears underlines that disinformation has become critical issue of our time
we should consider just whose mission it is that xe too important to jeopardize these days does anybody doubt that the clumsy language and inept cultural references of the russian trolls who seeded divisive pro trump messages during the election will improve as gains sophistication of course algorithm driven mass manipulation is only one weapon in propagandists xe arsenals alongside television and ideologically slanted talk radio but its reach is growing and it xe back door by which viral falsehoods infiltrate our increasingly acrimonious collective conversation
traditional media xe xe cone transmitter millions of receivers xe xe contain an inherently totalitarian structure add machine learning and feedback loop of toxic audiovisual content can reverberate in the echo chamber of social media as well linking friends with an ersatz intimacy that leaves them particularly susceptible to manipulation further amplified and retransmitted by fox news and right wing radio it xe ready to beam into the mind of the spectator in chief during his xe cexecutive time xe
where does hal xe red gaze come in set aside the troubling prospect of what might unfold when genuinely intelligent self improving is created xe presumably the arrival of nietzsche xe xc cbermensch what xe in question even with current incipient technologies is who gets to control them even as some devise new medicines and streamline agriculture with them others use them as powerful forces in opposition to enlightenment values xe liberty tolerance and constitutional governance
democracy depends on shared consensual reality xe something that xe being willfully undermined seemingly just yesterday peer to peer social networks were heralded as revolutionary liberation from centralized information controls and thus tools of individual human free will we still have it in our power to purge malicious abuse of these systems but facebook twitter youtube and others would need to plow much more money into policing their networks xe perhaps by themselves deploying countermeasures based on algorithms meanwhile we should demand that new tech savvy generation of leaders recognizes this danger and devises regulatory solutions that don xe hurt our first amendment rights neat trick of course xe but the problem cannot be ignored
in xe xe xe cautionary tale hal xe directive to deceive discovery xe crew leads to death and destruction xe but also ultimately to the computer xe defeat by dave the one human survivor on board
we should be so lucky

good evening here xe the latest
president trump doubled down on his surprise decision to try to scrap the entire affordable care act xe cif the supreme court rules that obamacare is out we xe ll have plan that is far better than obamacare xe he said
our reporters reconstructed how mr trump came to his decision
they describe heated meeting in the white house on monday in which mick mulvaney mr trump xe acting chief of staff pressed the president to keep his campaign promises to upend the law and urged him along with other officials to try to seize control of the health care issue from democrats
vice president mike pence and pat cipollone the white house counsel were among those who objected mr cipollone continued arguing in smaller meeting but mr mulvaney pictured above at the white house today prevailed
day of scrutiny for aviation
in hearings on capitol hill the xe acting administrator daniel elwell and the transportation secretary elaine chao were pressed about the cozy relationship between the and companies it regulates like boeing
xe clet me emphasize that safety is always no at the department of transportation and good day is when nothing bad happens xe ms chao said
meanwhile boeing appeared to acknowledge for the first time that its software played role in two fatal crashes of its max and said fix for the system was nearly ready
the path to brexit took another turn
prime minister theresa may said she would step down if britain xe parliament approved her beleaguered plan mrs may pictured above leaving downing street today did not say when
she made the offer just before lawmakers in parliament began voting on alternative plans
turmoil in the british government was not limited to that process officials are defending spending almost million on penthouse for diplomat in new york
india shot down low orbit satellite with ballistic missile prime minister narendra modi said
if confirmed the feat means india could essentially blind another country by taking out its space based communication and surveillance satellites the ability could potentially destabilize the relationship between india and pakistan two nuclear powers that already faced brief period of hostilities last month
it would also put india in small club of countries with such strategic power which includes china the and russia
some in india were suspicious about the timing of mr modi xe announcement shortly before general elections
xe cthe story is bizarre from beginning to end xe
that was the chicago mystery novelist sara paretsky commenting on the jussie smollett case
our bureau chief writes that the city riven by race class violence and secrecy was the ideal setting for the saga which ended with the mayor the prosecutor and mr smollett all insisting on different narratives for what occurred
prosecutors noted mr smollett xe community service work in explaining why they dropped the charges on tuesday that work included two days at the rev jesse jackson xe civil rights organization
eating pot brownies and other xe cedibles xe like gummy bears may be riskier than smoking or vaping potentially adding new obstacles to the bumpy process of state legalization
according to an analysis of emergency room visits in colorado edibles created disproportionate number of marijuana related medical crises
doctors involved with the study explained that ingesting pot takes longer to produce high than smoking it so some people have trouble gauging if they xe ve taken too much xe cthis is common phenomenon people take another dose xe said one doctor
it xe baseball eve
ahead of the new season our special section looks back years at what became known as the mets miracle the mets above suddenly developed into team to be reckoned with winning the world series after seven years of being baseball punch line
looking ahead the major leagues xe opening day is tomorrow kicking off season that our columnist says will be stuffed to the seams with players by one count record players appeared in major league game last season the sixth year in row with an increase this reflects pool of prospects xe cthat is bigger xe and cheaper xe than ever xe our columnist writes
the xe cnobel prize of computing xe went to three researchers whose work undergirds the revolution in artificial intelligence from face recognition services and smart speakers to warehouse robots and self driving cars
yann lecun geoffrey hinton and yoshua bengio above won the turing award for their work on neural networks loosely modeled on the web of neurons in the human brain these mathematical systems enable machine learning by analyzing vast amounts of data
players in the tech world seized on the story sharing it on their own vast network of websites and social media and driving it to near the top of our list of most reads
what else you xe re reading
also on our list of most read stories today mystery from scotland since the hundreds of dogs have thrown themselves off bridge in dumbarton above some have died
in country well acquainted with myth and superstition the xe cdog suicide bridge xe has invited paranormal explanations
xe ci xe convinced it xe ghost that is behind all of this xe said teacher who wrote book about it
one more our look at why people procrastinate it isn xe about laziness or self control but rather mood management
finally traveling safe while female
readers responded to our article this week about the dangers women face while traveling alone with an outpouring of suggestions
women some of whom have traveled to dozens or scores of countries affirmed their love of solo adventure they said they pack their own doorstops tip the hotel staff at the start of their stays make friends with older vendors and listen to their guts
and they enjoy themselves

each week kevin roose technology columnist at the new york times discusses developments in the tech industry offering analysis and maybe joke or two want this newsletter in your inbox sign up here
it xe hard to imagine now but at one point long ago facebook did not monopolize the entire tech news cycle xe heady and innocent era when you could read an entire day xe news without encountering the words xe ccambridge analytica xe or xe cthird party developers xe
confess that like many of you have been obsessed with the fallout from facebook xe latest privacy scandal to the point that had stress dream that overslept and missed covering mark zuckerberg xe testimony on capitol hill next week related need to get out more and possibly take up yoga
but despite the wall to wall news of the past few weeks lots of important things are happening in the tech world that don xe involve facebook so let xe run down few of them
thought this article by scott shane and daisuke wakabayashi about thousands of google employees who are protesting the company xe involvement in pentagon program was fascinating on number of levels
first it xe an unusually clear example of the double edged nature of artificial intelligence google has spent billions of dollars teaching computers to play go drive cars and translate languages on the fly the company has been extremely proud of its advances in machine learning even releasing some of its tools to the public via open source frameworks like tensorflow which provides fascinating contrast to what xe happening inside the company now when its image classification algorithms are used to spot tumors on radiology scans google puts out press release and engineers cheer but when these same types of algorithms are used by the pentagon to improve the accuracy of drone strikes it xe moral outrage
yonatan zunger former google engineer had an interesting op ed the other day in the boston globe about the xe creckonings xe that various scientific fields have undergone as the scientists who develop powerful tools begin to see how those tools can be used for evil purposes he used the examples of the atomic bomb which forever changed the way that physics was taught in universities and dynamite which made chemists aware of the consequences of their expertise it xe not hard to see as similar kind of turning point for computer scientists xe and if it is the google pentagon issue might be the first of many similar fights
second the google pentagon incident is revealing story about the leverage that silicon valley engineers have over their companies because the labor market for engineers in the bay area is so tight and because companies live and die on their ability to attract and retain talent these employees have much more say in how company like google governs itself than say regulators or outside activists if an antiwar group protests outside google xe headquarters it xe an annoyance but if engineers walk out it xe crisis and as the tech industry goes through its moral reckoning executives of these companies should bear in mind that their biggest risk isn xe regulation it xe rebellion from within
xe ve also been following the feud between amazon and president trump this week which has led to bull market for explainers about the business models of the united states postal service my colleague nick wingfield wrote that contra president trump the available evidence suggests that xe camazon has been boon to the postal service xe but vox xe jen kirby added that because the exact details of the contract between amazon and the postal service aren xe known it xe possible that president trump is partly right xe cmaybe the isn xe actually making the best deals xe meanwhile matt stoller fellow at the open markets institute says president trump is xe actually right xe that amazon is ripping off the federal government through its contracts
xe nonexpert on the subject of parcel shipping so my opinion on amazon xe the probably isn xe worth one first class stamp but it xe possible and maybe plausible that all of these analyses are partly correct xe that the postal service benefits from amazon xe dominance and that amazon is getting sweetheart deal that should be re examined anyway amazon xe stock dipped sharply after president trump started tweeting angry things about it but it has now recovered to its pre tweetstorm levels meaning that investors may be as confused as am
last and most obvious the horrific shooting at youtube on tuesday which injured three people and left the company badly shaken as more details have emerged on nasim najafi aghdam whom the police have identified as the attacker it has become increasingly clear that this was new kind of violence xe an act of revenge by an internet creator against the platform that she felt controlled her economic destiny as my colleagues nellie bowles and jack nicas wrote xe cms aghdam xe complaints echoed what wide range of youtube posters xe from self described animal rights activists like her to right wing political provocateurs xe have increasingly been protesting over the last year xe
it xe tragic reminder that social platforms aren xe just websites anymore they xe re powerful economies unto themselves and even seemingly minor policy decisions can alter the lives of millions of people few of whom might be disturbed enough to act on their darkest impulses

artificial intelligence has bested top players in chess go and even starcraft but can it fly drone faster than pro racer more than million is on the line to find out
by jake swearingen
drone from the university of zurich is an engineering and technical marvel it also moves slower than someone taking sunday morning jog
at the international conference on intelligent robots and systems in madrid last october the autonomous drone which navigates using artificial intelligence raced through complicated series of turns and gates buzzing and moving like determined and oversized bumblebee it bobbed to duck under bar that swooshed like clock hand yawed left pitched forward and raced toward the finish line the drone small and covered in sensors demolished the competition blazing through the course twice as fast as its nearest competitor its top speed miles per hour
few weeks earlier in jeddah saudi arabia different drone flown remotely by its pilot paul nurkkala shot through gate at the top of foot high tower inverted into roll and then dove toward the earth competitors trailed behind or crashed into pieces along the course but this one swerved and corkscrewed through two twin arches hit straightaway and then blasted into the netting that served as the finish line for the drone racing league xe world championship the winning drone league standard racer reached speeds over miles per hour but it needed human to guide it mr nurkkala known to fans as nurk wore pair of goggles that beamed him first person view of his drone as he flew it
artificial intelligence or has been on hot streak besting humans in competitions over the past five years alphago program built by deepmind the artificial intelligence arm of google parent alphabet went from learning the basics of the game go to beating the world xe best human player in little over three years more recently the program alphastar also by deepmind was able to beat top player in the complex strategy video game xe cstarcraft ii xe shutting out its human competitor five games to zero
but the real world can be an immensely noisy place and many powered and autonomous vehicles still struggle to excel in it
in nasa xe jet propulsion laboratory built three autonomous drones and pitted them in race against ken loo an expert drone pilot he easily beat them all darpa xe fast lightweight autonomy program has been able to send drones through tight hallways at miles per hour faster than the one from the university of zurich but in less complex setting and slower than human pilot piloted drone swooping and arcing around course while an autonomous drone hesitantly chugs through space is the difference between an point guard driving toward the basket and toddler learning to walk
onboard computers will get more powerful algorithms for developing optimal flight paths will become optimized new image processing techniques will shrink the time it takes for computer to understand what it sees from milliseconds to microseconds while the human eye will always have milliseconds of latency in processing visual stimuli but that xe in the future right now an autonomous drone completing racecourse at speed faster than miles per hour will be an accomplishment
this year new competition will try to make sure autonomous drones are more nimble xe and that they are truly able to act by themselves
xe cright now autonomous drones are thing you xe only find in labs being pioneered by small niche audience xe said keith lynn lockheed martin xe program manager for alphapilot an autonomous drone racing competition organized by the drone racing league
the alphapilot competition which is sponsored by lockheed martin and part of the racing league xe new artificial intelligence robotic racing circuit aims to drive interest and research into self driving or autonomous vehicles nine teams will compete this fall out of currently making their way through qualifying rounds xe students researchers and independent drone enthusiasts among others xe according to the organizers the winning team will take home prize of million if the drone can also beat top human pilot in head to head race the team will get an extra
competitors the league said will program racer that includes an artificial intelligence chip made by nvidia partner in the competition the nine qualifying teams will be announced this spring according to the organizers
for autonomous drones to be useful xe xc xa in disaster zones as delivery vehicles or in rural areas xe they will need to be able to fly far fast and without human oversight often in environments where they can xe rely on external guidance systems like gps and that xe one of their biggest challenges
xe ccurrent autonomous drones have very little onboard decision making xe said kerry snyder founder of kef robotics competing team from pittsburgh xe cthey will almost always be following very specific human commands and rarely be able to accomplish higher level tasks such as xe find trapped person xe or xe fly through an open window and then explore xe xe
there xe also gap between code created in the lab and real world flying xe ca lot of our is primarily developed in simulation xe said dr chelsea sabo technical lead of the alphapilot program at lockheed martin xe cgoing from simulation to the real world is going to be big challenge in alphapilot xe
machine learning allows for to train much faster than flesh and blood pilots human who wants to practice for hours needs three and half years of eight hour days computer using machine learning can fly simulated hours overnight
eric amoroso another co founder of kef robotics said that autonomous vehicles can also be more precise than human pilots autonomous drones can fly more precisely by making subtle alterations to how much thrust each propeller produces for example he said and can use information from sensors that humans don xe have like an accelerometer to estimate where it is in space
but where humans excel xe and in general falls short xe is in merging those individual skills into cohesive whole and doing it as fast as humans are capable xe csensing the world making decisions acting on it and doing that in real time that xe really the fundamental challenge of robotics xe mr amoroso said
autonomous drones also struggle to make sense of visual information particularly at high speeds in part because of shortcomings in sensors xe cthe main challenge of autonomous drone flight is perception based on cameras xe said davide scaramuzza professor of robotics and perception at the university of zurich and the creator of the autonomous drone that won the competition in madrid last year xe cthe faster the drone goes the more blurred the image gets xe
drone flying in the alphapilot competition will only be able to fly based on what it can see in front of it and must use that information to know where it is in physical space at miles per hour even at the calculating speed computers are capable of an autonomous drone won xe be able to process images as fast as human can and may be thrown off course by something as simple as shadow leading it to miss gate or believe it xe one foot to the right of where it actually is at best this means the autonomous drone will need to course correct slowing it down at worst it crashes
there xe also the issue of strategy xe ca pilot with thousands of hours of flight time isn xe just thinking about the gate in front of them xe mr nurkkala the racing league champion said xe cthey xe re thinking about the next five or six gates and how to position themselves to keep the best racing line xe inside simulator an alphapilot drone might be able to make those same sorts of tactical and strategic plans on real world course moving at speed it may just be doing its best to hit each gate
and going fast is calculation of risk versus reward if you xe re flying without ever crashing mr nurkkala said you xe re not flying as fast as possible for teams programming alphapilot drones this will mean training those drones to make trade offs of when to speed up and when to play it safe xe decisions humans often make instinctually xe cin our simulations we can tune our system so that it finishes the course percent of the time but it flies pretty slow xe mr snyder said xe cor we can tune it to finish the course percent of the time but it flies much faster xe the winner of the alphapilot competition xe xc xa and of its million grand prize xe will likely be the team that not only optimizes its algorithms but also take the smartest risks
and if an autonomous drone can outrace human controlled one xe cin my opinion it would be very similar to deep blue or alphago xe mr snyder said referring to the chess playing computer and the deepmind xe cit represents major step in technical progress and innovation even if in limited environment where an autonomous robot could realistically outperform human that xe in contrast to the infinite and fractal complexity of self driving cars xe
mr lynn is more effusive xe ceveryone will know the programmers behind that team they xe ll be celebrities companies will want to endorse them kids will aspire to be them that xe exciting from stem perspective xe
and mr lynn believes professional pilots will also take notice xe ci think you xe ll also see the human piloted races change as pilots learn from the efficiencies that only computer and code can hone in on and approach maneuvers in entirely new ways that xe exciting for the future of human and machine teamwork xe

when you look across america to see where jobs and wages have been lost to robotics machine learning artificial intelligence and automation it is the middle of the country that stands apart from the rest
the accompanying map which was produced by daron acemoglu of and pascual restrepo of boston university shows the size and scope of the region that has borne the brunt of postindustrial modernization
it is not coincidence that this map sheds light on president trump xe electoral college victory in
xe cmy take is that grievances both racial and against cosmopolitan liberal elites have played an important role xe acemoglu wrote me in an email
but economic hardships as they often do made these fault lines more salient dormant grievances have become more alive
acemoglu argues that recent technological developments have helped drive voters to the right
the swing to republicans between and is quite bit stronger in commuting zones most affected by industrial robots you don xe see much of the impact of robots in prior presidential elections so it xe really post phenomenon
in their march paper xe robots and jobs evidence from us labor markets xe acemoglu and restrepo found that the addition of
one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about percentage points and wages by percent
who are the workers forced to bear the costs of the increase in workplace robots
according to acemoglu and restrepo men take about twice as big hit in terms of lost jobs as women do although both sexes suffer wage losses when robots replace people the size of the drop in employment for women was about half that of men
in terms of occupational sectors the authors found that
the effects of robots concentrate in automobile manufacturing electronics metal products chemicals pharmaceuticals plastic food glass and ceramics
workers without college degrees experience substantially larger wage and employment losses when exposed to competition from robots while the same competition results in
small and marginally significant negative effect on employment for workers with college and no effect on employment and wages for workers with post college degrees
in political terms the workers who experience the highest costs from industrial automation fit the crucial trump voter demographic white non college voters disproportionately male whose support for the republican nominee surged from to xe as shown in the accompanying graphic which is based on data from the pew research center
the graphic shows major transformation of the republican presidential electorate among whites with college degrees support for trump fell by percentage points compared with support for mitt romney among whites without degrees trump xe support rose by points when compared with romney xe
the increase in workplace robots was not alone in driving voters to the right communities where industries lost ground to imports from china followed similar pattern
in september paper xe importing political polarization the electoral consequences of rising trade exposure xe david autor who is also an economist at and three of his colleagues dug further into the demographics of those suffering the economic costs of trade with china
autor and his co authors found that
trade exposure catalyzed strong movements towards conservative republicans between and in counties with majority non hispanic white populations
the gains made by hard right republicans came at the expense of moderate republican and democratic incumbents
even more significant autor determined that though generally speaking trade shocks did not xe cfavor conservative politicians xe shocks xe cthat disproportionately affect white males xe did
the authors provide more detail explaining that the
rightward shift is driven by trade shocks to industries that have traditionally employed white men in relatively large numbers and is largely unrelated to shocks to other industries
autor and his co authors cite research showing that
voters choose to supply fewer public goods when significant fraction of tax revenues collected from one ethnic group is used to provide public goods shared with other ethnic groups
and that
voters in an in group object to their tax contributions being used to support individuals in out groups
that translates to white voters especially white men oppose paying taxes for programs that primarily provide services to others in practice the authors suggest trade shocks
catalyze anti redistributionist sentiment seen in the election of conservative republicans in majority white non hispanic locations where taxpayers may perceive themselves as transfer payment donors
this white male effect was critical to the link connecting as autor and his co authors write
economic adversity to in group out group identification as motivated by group based resource competition or opportunistic use of political extremism
their analysis resonates they suggest
with the themes of recent literature on the political economy of right wing populism in which economic shocks to dominant population groups engender political response that sharpens group identities and enhances support for conservative politicians this pattern is evident in our finding that the impact of trade shocks on political polarization appears largely attributable to increases in foreign competition facing manufacturing industries that are intensive in the employment of non hispanic white males
acemoglu autor and their colleagues provide synthesis between the economic and the sociocultural explanations of the rise of the populist right in doing so they provide corrective to the recent tendency in segments of the liberal media to downplay economic factors and to focus instead on racial resentment and cultural dislocation as the primary forces motivating trump voters
myself have written that
republican voters have strong sense of white identity they harbor high levels of racial resentment and they sometimes exhibit authoritarian leanings
the point here is that the two generalized explanatory realms xe the one focused on race and the other on economic shock xe overlap it is not either or but both that gave us president trump
still explanations tend to become monocausal
take for example the dec headline at the vox website xe cthe past year of research has made it very clear trump won because of racial resentment xe according to german lopez the article xe author xe cemployment and income were not significantly related to that sense of white vulnerability xe what was xe cracial resentment xe
may story in the atlantic asserted that
that fear of societal change not economic pressure motivated votes for the president among non salaried workers without college degrees
those stories were by no means alone salon xe cliberals were right racism played larger role in trump xe win than income and authoritarianism xe the nation xe ceconomic anxiety didn xe make people vote trump racism did xe
the debate over the role of economic hardship among whites in building support for trump began while the campaign was in full swing
nate silver founder and editor of the fivethirtyeight website wrote xe the mythology of trump xe xe working class xe support xe in the midst of the primary fight for the republican nomination
xe ccompared with most americans trump xe voters are better off the median household income of trump voter so far in the primaries is about xe silver pointed out xe cwell above the national median household income of about xe
silver xe argument is accurate insofar as it goes but it does not go far enough
in the primaries trump xe voters were more affluent than the general electorate but among republican primary voters the core of trump xe support was among those with the lowest level of education and in most cases the lowest income levels
take look at the exit polls from the march virginia primary trump beat his closest competitor senator marco rubio among those without college degrees while rubio beat trump among those with degrees trump beat rubio among voters making less than but rubio beat trump among those making more than the same pattern was repeated over and over again in primaries across the country
trump xe strongest support in the primaries and in the general election came disproportionately from the least well educated whites xe those who as acemoglu and autor argue are most vulnerable to the economic dislocation resulting from automation the rise of robot work force global trade and outsourcing
in an email autor describes how the two explanatory models dovetail he starts with question
do you think non college non urban whites would feel so dislocated if their job prospects were strong and their wages rising
he then goes on to point out that
all of these observations xe authoritarianism racism cultural dislocation xe have relevance the only claim that xe irrelevant because it xe already been disproved is that economic factors were unimportant to trump xe victory

san francisco xe uber says it is not renewing its permit to test self driving vehicles in california until the police and regulators wrap up an investigation into how one of its autonomous vehicles struck and killed woman in arizona last week
the company decided to withdraw its renewal application late last week the move came to light in letter that california xe department of motor vehicles sent to uber on tuesday
the letter informed uber that its testing permit will expire on saturday and that it will have to address xe cany follow up analysis or investigations from the recent crash in arizona xe if it applies for new permit in the future
the loss of the permit reported earlier by the san francisco chronicle is the latest roadblock for uber as the company weighs the future of its self driving car program
uber halted all testing of its driverless cars after one of them killed elaine herzberg who was walking her bicycle across road in tempe ariz the car was going miles per hour and did not slow down before impact the tempe police said
arizona xe governor doug ducey ordered the company to suspend the testing of its autonomous vehicles on monday eight days after the crash saying footage of the accident xe craises many questions about the ability of uber to continue testing in arizona xe
uber said it withdrew its california application on friday because it wouldn xe have been able to respond to questions from the state xe regulators until it had time to review the findings of the investigation in arizona
xe cwe proactively suspended our self driving operations including in california immediately following the tempe incident xe said sarah abboud an uber spokeswoman xe cgiven this we decided to not reapply for california permit with the understanding that our self driving vehicles would not operate on public roads in the immediate future xe
uber initially applied to renew its permit few days after the crash when the opened the mailed application on friday it called the company to confirm department spokeswoman said and uber asked to withdraw the request the asked for the withdrawal in writing and it received an email on saturday
uber has said it is cooperating with investigations by the tempe police the national transportation safety board and the national highway traffic safety administration none of the investigations have determined whether uber was at fault in the crash
the intense focus on the accident has also prompted uber xe suppliers to evaluate its technology on tuesday spokesman for nvidia supplier of semiconductors and other computer hardware used in uber xe autonomous vehicles said it was suspending its tests of self driving cars on public roads in order to xe clearn from the uber incident xe the price of nvidia shares fell percent on the news
uber has not said when it plans to resume testing its autonomous vehicles the bulk of uber xe testing was in arizona but it was also driving autonomous vehicles on roads in san francisco pittsburgh and toronto alexis campbell community relations manager for pennsylvania xe department of transportation said it would work with uber to ensure that safety was the top priority if tested was restarted in the state
uber has had rocky history with the california in uber started testing its self driving cars in san francisco without permit arguing that one wasn xe necessary because safety driver was monitoring the vehicles
the disagreed and ordered uber to apply for permit when uber refused the department revoked the registrations for the cars that uber was testing in the city
after california revoked the registrations mr ducey said arizona welcomed uber xe cars with xe copen arms and wide open roads xe in public showing uber loaded its cars onto truck and hauled them to arizona uber eventually applied for permit and resumed testing in san francisco last march

each week technology reporters and columnists from the new york times review the week xe news offering analysis and maybe joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry want this newsletter in your inbox sign up here
greetings from sunny san francisco xe nathaniel popper times reporter covering financial technology and strange things like bitcoin and the blockchain
wrote story this week about crazy scheme to build blockchain based community in the nevada desert but couldn xe help spending much of the week riveted by the work my colleagues were doing
few years ago an apple product introduction which was covered this week by jack nicas or the quarterly earnings announcements of the big companies might have been the thing everyone was talking about
and in more ordinary times the biggest news in silicon valley would have been the fallout from the article that my colleagues daisuke wakabayashi and katie benner published last week about google and its handling of sexual harassment
thousands of google employees walked out of work on thursday to protest the company xe policies and decision making earlier in the week one of the executives named in the times article richard devaul resigned google xe chief executive sundar pichai said that his initial response and apology had not been forceful enough he promised to support and work with internal critics
but all of this happened at time when silicon valley was fixated on the role technology might have played in the deadly synagogue shooting last saturday not far from where grew up in pittsburgh and the package bombs that were intercepted last week
in the days after those events kevin roose looked at how cesar sayoc jr the man who was accused of sending the pipe bombs had fallen into maelstrom of right wing conspiracy theories on facebook and twitter these theories appear to have stoked mr sayoc xe anger toward the people mostly democratic politicians who received the pipe bombs
kevin followed that up by examining the online postings of robert bowers the man accused in the slaughter in pittsburgh who had used the fringe online network gab to voice his hatred of jews and immigrants kevin also hosted two fascinating episodes of the daily podcast where he examined the rise of anger stoking websites and russian propaganda aimed at creating discord
the big social networks have of course been trying to confront the spread of divisive news and misinformation on their platforms facebook xe quarterly financial results which it announced on tuesday showed slowdown in revenue that appears to have been caused at least in part by the company xe efforts to rein in bad actors
but flurry of reports this week underscored how ineffective these measures have been vice reporter william turton found that despite facebook xe new efforts at advertising transparency he was able to get approval for ads that he posted in the name of fake political groups and sitting senators when twitter unveiled page dedicated to capturing news on the midterm elections buzzfeed quickly noticed that the page was spotlighting disinformation
even when one social network manages to drive away bad actors those bad actors are generally able to find other online outlets for their activities sheera frenkel mike isaac and kate conger shined spotlight on how instagram has become the latest hot spot for anti semitic material few days after the synagogue shooting social network that began as place to post happy vacation photos was found to be hosting over posts with hashtag that blamed jews for the terrorist attacks
kara swisher who has been covering the tech world for decades wrote column for the times this week where she described how the internet which promised to promote global harmony has instead become tool of hate
all in all it was enough to make at least this reporter long for time when new ipad was the thing everything was talking about
some other tech stories of note this week
xe xa nellie bowles wrote powerful trio of stories about our troubled relationship with the screens that dominate our lives her first story looked at how many people in silicon valley do everything in their power to keep their children away from screens some parents have gone so far as to bar the people taking care of their children from ever using phone or other electronic device in front of the kids
not long ago people were worried about poor children missing out on the digital revolution now nellie reported there is more concern that poor children are getting too much of the revolution in the form of screen time while wealthier parents keep their children away from addictive digital devices
xe xa most americans have probably not heard of bytedance the chinese company raymond zhong profiled this week but the company has risen into an unlikely goliath of the internet xe with value of around billion xe by serving up lots and lots of fluff in china the company has bunch of different applications that allow young users to share everything from news to their latest break dancing moves outside china the company xe video platform tiktok has gained popularity as place to broadcast short personal videos
xe xa thomas fuller and cade metz explained that scientists are getting better at understanding earthquakes and potentially providing early warnings thanks to artificial intelligence earthquake predictions have been notoriously bad but some people in the field said their experiments had been helped by the kind of neural networks that are used to program talking digital assistants and driverless cars
who said we don xe have any good news

elon musk and mark zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence space travel and the direction of technology
on friday mr musk showed just how little love lost there was between the two tech titans
mr musk the chief executive of spacex and tesla deleted the facebook pages of both of his companies in doing so he joined growing chorus of tech leaders calling for people to abandon mr zuckerberg xe social network after it allowed political consulting firm cambridge analytica to obtain and misuse data on million users the revelations have plunged facebook into its worst public relations crisis in years
as with most news in mr musk xe decision started with barrage of tweets
the tech luminary began by criticizing sonos maker of wireless speakers which had pulled some ads from facebook for week
xe cwow whole week risky xe mr musk tweeted in response to news article about sonos xe move
minute later he replied to brian acton the founder of whatsapp which facebook had acquired for billion several years ago mr acton who has since left facebook had on wednesday called for people to xe deletefacebook xe
xe cwhat xe facebook xe mr musk replied to mr acton then mr musk announced he would shut down the spacex and tesla pages he said the tesla facebook page xe looks lame anyway xe
the posts which sent the twittersphere into virtual frenzy escalated public feud between mr musk and mr zuckerberg mr musk has often urged people to be cautious of embracing technology such as artificial intelligence because of the consequences it might bring once saying that it could become so powerful it would start wars and turn people into its xe house cats xe
mr zuckerberg has argued that people need to trust and embrace technology in their lives when the facebook chief executive was asked about mr musk xe warnings around artificial intelligence during facebook live broadcast in he called mr musk xe cnaysayer xe that xe an insult in technology world that celebrates perpetual optimism
xe cwith especially xe really optimistic xe mr zuckerberg said xe cpeople who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios xe just don xe understand it think it xe really negative and in some ways actually think it is pretty irresponsible xe
in response mr musk shot back that mr zuckerberg did not fully comprehend the issues
xe ci xe ve talked to mark about this xe mr musk wrote xe chis understanding of the subject is limited xe
the two have also clashed on space travel mr zuckerberg traveled to kenya in for the launch of facebook affiliated satellite called amos which was set to go to outer space in spacex rocket but the rocket exploded mr zuckerberg released chilly statement
xe cas xe here in africa xe deeply disappointed to hear that spacex xe launch failure destroyed our satellite that would have provided connectivity to so many entrepreneurs and everyone else across the continent xe he wrote on facebook
mr musk is frequent twitter presence who has posted increasingly macho and humor focused messages including video of himself playing with flamethrower
he said he plans to keep using his instagram account which is owned by facebook and on which he has million followers
when one reporter said on twitter that it was remarkable mr musk had so much time to troll online mr musk wrote xe cwhat troll me xe
facebook and spacex didn xe immediately have comment on mr musk xe deleted pages tesla spokeswoman did not have comment beyond mr musk xe tweets

one of the best selling shirts for the indian commerce site myntra is an olive blue and yellow colorblocked design it was conceived not by human but by computer algorithm xe or rather two algorithms
the first algorithm generated random images that it tried to pass off as clothing the second had to distinguish between those images and clothes in myntra xe inventory through long game of one upmanship the first algorithm got better at producing images that resembled clothing and the second got better at determining whether they were like xe but not identical to xe actual products
this back and forth an example of artificial intelligence at work created designs whose sales are now xe cgrowing at percent xe said ananth narayanan the company xe chief executive xe cit xe working xe
clothing design is only the leading edge of the way algorithms are transforming the fashion and retail industries companies now routinely use artificial intelligence to decide which clothes to stock and what to recommend to customers
and fashion which has long shed blue collar jobs in the united states is in turn leading example of how artificial intelligence is affecting range of white collar work as well that xe especially true of jobs that place premium on spotting patterns from picking stocks to diagnosing cancer
xe ca much broader set of tasks will be automated or augmented by machines over the coming years xe erik brynjolfsson an economist at the massachusetts institute of technology and tom mitchell carnegie mellon computer scientist wrote in the journal science last year they argued that most of the jobs affected would become partly automated rather than disappear altogether
the fashion industry illustrates how machines can intrude even on workers known more for their creativity than for cold empirical judgments among those directly affected will be the buyers and merchandise planners who decide which dresses tops and pants should populate their stores xe inventory
key part of buyer xe job is to anticipate what customers will want using well honed sense of where fashion trends are headed xe cbased on the fact that you sold pairs of platform shoes last month maybe you could sell next month xe said kristina shiroka who spent several years as buyer for the outnet an online retailer xe cbut people might be over it by then so you cut the buy xe
merchandise planners then use the buyer xe input to figure out what mix of clothing xe say how many sandals pumps and flats xe will help the company reach its sales goals
in the small but growing precincts of the industry where high powered algorithms roam free however it is the machine xe and not the buyer xe gut xe that often anticipates what customers will want
that xe the case at stitch fix an online styling service that sends customers boxes of clothing whose contents they can keep or return and maintains detailed profiles of customers to personalize their shipments
stitch fix relies heavily on algorithms to guide its buying decisions xe in fact its business probably could not exist without them those algorithms project how many clients will be in given situation or xe cstate xe several months into the future like expanding their wardrobe after say starting new job and what volume of clothes people tend to buy in each situation the algorithms also know which styles people with different profiles tend to favor xe say petite nurse with children who lives in texas
myntra the indian online retailer arms its buyers with algorithms that calculate the probability that an item will sell well based on how clothes with similar attributes xe sleeves colors fabric xe have sold in the past the buyers are free to ignore the projection
all of this has clouded the future of buyers and merchandise planners high status workers whose annual earnings can exceed
at more conventional retailers team of buyers and support workers is assigned to each type of clothing like designer contemporary or casual or each apparel category like dresses or tops some retailers have separate teams for knit tops and woven tops parallel merchandise planning group could employ nearly as many people
buyers say this specialization helps them intuitively understand trends in styles and colors xe cyou xe re so immersed in it you almost get feeling xe said helena levin longtime buyer at retailers like charlotte russe and modcloth
ms levin cited mint green dresses top seller earlier this decade xe cone day it just died xe she said xe cit stopped xe everything mint get out xe right after it looked old you could feel it xe
but retailers adept at using algorithms and big data tend to employ fewer buyers and assign each wider range of categories partly because they rely less on intuition
at le tote an online rental and retail service for women xe clothing that does hundreds of millions of dollars in business each year six person team handles buying for all branded apparel xe dresses tops pants jackets
brett northart co founder said the company xe algorithms could identify what to add to its stock based on how many customers placed the items on their digital wish lists along with factors like online ratings and recent purchases
bombfell box service similar to stitch fix catering only to men relies on single employee nathan cates to buy all of its tops and accessories
the company has built algorithmic tools and vast repository of data to help mr cates who said he could more accurately project demand for clothing than buyer at traditional operation
xe cwe know exactly who our customers are xe he said xe cwe know exactly where they live what their jobs are what their sizing is xe
for now at least only human can do parts of his job mr cates is obsessive about touching the fabric before purchasing an item and almost always tries it on first
xe cif this is light color are we going to see your nipples xe he explained the verdict on mint shirt he donned at the company xe headquarters in new york xe ca little nipply xe
there are other checks on automation negotiations with suppliers typically require human touch even if an algorithm can help buyers make decisions more quickly and accurately there are limits to the number of supplier relationships they can juggle
arti zeighami who oversees advanced analytics and artificial intelligence for the amp group which uses artificial intelligence to guide supply chain decisions said the company was xe cenhancing and empowering xe human buyers and planners not replacing them but he conceded it was hard to predict the effect on employment in five to years
experts say some of these jobs will be automated away the bureau of labor statistics expects employment of wholesale and retail buyers to contract by percent over decade versus percent increase for all occupations some of this is because of the automation of less sophisticated tasks like cataloging inventory and buying for less stylistically demanding retailers say auto parts
there is at least one area of the industry where the machines are creating jobs rather than eliminating them however bombfell stitch fix and many competitors in the box fashion niche employ growing army of human stylists who receive recommendations from algorithms about clothes that might work for customer but decide for themselves what to send
xe cif they xe re not overly enthusiastic upfront when ask how do you feel about it xe making note of it xe said jade carmosino sales manager and stylist at trunk club stitch fix competitor owned by nordstrom
in this stylists appear to reflect broader trend in industries where artificial intelligence is automating white collar jobs the hiring of more humans to stand between machines and customers
for example chida khatua the chief executive of equbot which helped create an exchange traded fund that is actively managed by artificial intelligence predicted that the asset management industry would hire more financial advisers even as investing became largely automated
the downside is that work as stylist or financial adviser will probably pay less than the lost jobs of buyers and stock pickers the good news said daron acemoglu an economist at who studies automation is that these jobs may still pay substantially more than many positions available to low and middle skilled workers in recent decades
and these jobs may be hard to automate in the end
xe cif xe the customer explaining what want humans need to be involved xe mr khatua said xe csometimes don xe know what really want xe

scottsdale ariz xe last thursday morning in the desert town of scottsdale ariz tiny robotic car turned onto neighborhood street and pulled up to home with spanish tiled roof and synthetic grass in the front yard
not even half the size of volkswagen beetle the toylike vehicle had no driver and no passengers instead it held six bags of groceries from the fry xe food store down the road one observer oohed and aahed over how cute the car seemed
designed by start up called nuro the vehicle was making test run as part of partnership with fry xe on an autonomous delivery service starting this week nuro said two of these small electric cars will chug along local streets at no faster than miles an hour to deliver groceries to nearby homes
if it all looked bit ridiculous that xe because self driving is still technology in search of purpose with driverless passenger services from the likes of waymo uber and general motors slow to become realities the autonomous industry is casting about for practical uses xe and hitting upon experiments like food deliveries from cars that make golf cart seem spacious
other start ups are now moving self driving technology off roads altogether and onto sidewalks avoiding the risks of traffic there are regulatory hurdles here too postmates san francisco delivery start up announced plans last week to offer service that features robotic shopping cart that runs along sidewalks and has digital eyes that blink every now and again still other companies are targeting long haul trucking in which driverless vehicles carry cases of beer and other goods but not passengers
xe cafter maybe biting off more than they could chew people are concentrating on one particular part of the problem they might be able to actually make money from xe said tarin ziyaee who worked on autonomous technologies at apple and who recently left voyage company that is bringing self driving cars to retirement communities
as whole autonomous vehicles are still three to four years from the point where they can make regular trips with no safety drivers said don burnette chief executive and founder of the driverless trucking company kodiak robotics autonomous passenger services he added are more like seven to years away
xe cthe more people work on urban self driving the more they realize what long road it is xe he said
nuro was founded in by dave ferguson and jiajun zhu two key engineers from google xe self driving project which eventually morphed into the waymo autonomous business both have the same parent company alphabet nuro which is based in mountain view calif and has raised million in funding decided to focus on creating tiny self driving cars xe they measure inches long by inches wide by inches high xe that would solely make local deliveries
mr ferguson said there was an opportunity to automate all the trips that americans make to local stores for goods and services xe like buying groceries and picking up laundry xe citing statistics that these errands account for significant portion of all car journeys
xe cif we can reduce the cost of these deliveries and get them to you faster than you could make the trip yourself xe he said xe cthere would be no reason for you to get in the car xe
while that endgame is nowhere close to reality mr ferguson said it was closer than autonomous passenger services that xe because nuro does not have to worry about the comfort and safety of anyone in the vehicle and by making the delivery automobiles much smaller than regular car it can also increase the margin of error on the roads
xe cthere is qualitative difference when you don xe have to worry about passengers xe he said
the trouble is that when testing this technology nuro cannot put someone in the mini vehicle who can take over in case of emergency so the start up began by tests in full size cars it is now confident enough in its technology to put its tiny vehicles on public roads
mr ferguson who often refers to nuro xe mini cars as rolling toasters acknowledged that the idea can seem xe cweird xe but he said he ultimately sees them as safer way of getting autonomous technology rolling
last thursday the nuro cars looked even odder on second glance xe because they were being trailed by regular size vehicles dark toyota prius with small wireless antenna perched on its rooftop was following just behind the self driving robots this was what the company calls shadow car which ferries technicians who can remotely take control of the robotic vehicle if anything goes wrong
nuro declined to discuss its financial arrangement with fry xe it said that delivery today using its mini autonomous vehicles costs once it removes most of the human labor from deliveries mr ferguson said the company can reduce the cost further and eventually serve people that cannot afford deliveries today
even so it was unclear how much demand there would be for the service joe schott who saw the tiny nuro car pass his bicycle on recent afternoon said it was ideal for his sister who is disabled xe cit xe hard for her to get groceries in and out of her car xe he said
but keri diggins who shops at fry xe and teaches sociology at local college questioned how much the service would suit people who are elderly or physically impaired
xe ca car can xe take the food to your doorstep xe she said
when one of nuro xe cars pulled up to the curb in scottsdale last week noticed it had small motorcycle rearview mirrors on it even though the mirrors serve no practical purpose federal regulations for low speed vehicles require the use of rearview mirrors mr ferguson said
xe cit xe easier for us just to put them on than to try to get exemptions xe he said
to see how well the cars worked walked up to the vehicle and punched pin code into small digital touch pad the doors opened upward revealing two compartments filled with grocery bags
as leaned forward to grab them hit my head on the open door then reaching for the other bags hit my head again
it was moment that showed how difficult it can be to design machines that interact with humans in creating its robot nuro had not provided as much headroom as it should have xe and people behave in inexplicable ways
xe cwe xe ll take the blame for the first one xe mr ferguson said with smile xe cthe second one is on you xe
in newer design he added the doors will open higher so tall people will not hit their heads

most of the time the new york times asks you to read something today we are inviting you simply to look on this page you will find maps showing almost every building in the united states
why did we make such thing we did it as an opportunity for you to connect with the country xe cities and explore them in detail to find the familiar and to discover the unfamiliar
so xe xa look every black speck on the map below is building reflecting the built legacy of the united states
use the search bar to find place and explore the interactive map below use two fingers to pan and zoom on the map
there was time when every car glove compartment was crammed with tattered fold out road maps trim rectangles that became table size monsters that challenged you to refold them neatly
we traced our proposed routes ahead of time seeing that say after new jersey would come pennsylvania which would take forever to cross and then ohio indiana illinois iowa and beyond the maps connected us to the places
fewer of us use maps like that today we gaze at our phones pinching and stretching an image but seeing the world through little rectangular window
the phone xe guidance is better but the view is not we xe re less likely to know what we are driving past
xe cwe lose what xe fascinating about place by not having this bigger picture xe said susan crawford professor at harvard law school whose work involves cities and technology who looked at the images at our request xe cthey make you think big thoughts everybody becomes robert moses looking at these maps xe
these images are drawn from huge database that microsoft released to the public this year the company xe computer engineers trained neural network to analyze satellite imagery and then to trace the shapes of buildings across the country such information has been available before in some places but this is the first comprehensive database covering the entire united states
in some cases we have augmented the data with information from state and local governments that have collected their own
classic maps answer questions like how do get from point to point these data images instead evoke questions xe sometimes simply what xe that
we found fascinating patterns in the arrangements of buildings traditional road maps highlight streets and highways here they show up as linear absence
where buildings are clustered together in downtowns the image is darker dense as suburbs stretch out with their larger lawns and malls the map grows lighter your eye can follow the ways that development conforms to landscape features like water and slopes
you can read history in the transition from curving paved over cow paths in old downtowns to suburban sprawl you can detect signals of wealth and poverty sometimes almost next door to each other it all reveals what andy woodruff cartographer calls xe cthe sometimes aesthetically pleasing patterns of the built environment xe
these images don xe just reveal cityscapes they reveal ourselves
below more details on what the map reveals about the structures that surround us
the nation xe expansion shows itself the clustered development of the original colonies flowed west with scattered cities and towns linked like beads on string by rivers highways and railroads

researchers in singapore explained how they created robot that could devise and execute plan to put together an ikea chair
by niraj chokshi
robots have taken our jobs learned our chores and beaten us at our own games
now researchers in singapore say they have trained one to perform another task known to confound humans figuring out how to assemble furniture from ikea
team from nanyang technological university programmed robot to create and execute plan to piece together most of ikea xe solid pine stefan chair on its own calling on medley of human skills to do so the researchers explained their work in study published on wednesday in the journal science robotics
xe cif you think about it it requires perception it requires you to plan motion it requires control between the robot and the environment it requires transporting an object with two arms simultaneously xe said dr quang cuong pham an assistant professor of engineering at the university and one of the paper xe authors xe cbecause this task requires so many interesting skills for robots we felt that it could be good project to push our capabilities to the limit xe
he and his nanyang colleagues who worked on the study francisco su xc xa rez ruiz and xian zhou aren xe alone
in recent years handful of others have set out to teach robots to assemble ikea furniture task that can mimic the manipulations robots can or may someday perform on factory floors and that involves brand many know all too well
xe cit xe something that almost everybody is familiar with and almost everybody hates doing xe said ross knepper an assistant professor of computer science at cornell university whose research focuses on human robot interaction
in mr knepper was part of team at the massachusetts institute of technology that presented paper on its work in the area describing the xe cikeabot xe the team created which could assemble the company xe lack table on its own
but chairs with backs stretchers and other parts pose more complex challenge hence the interest of the nanyang researchers
their robot was made of custom software three dimensional camera two robotic arms grippers and force detectors the team chose only off the shelf tools in order to mirror human biology
xe chumans have the same hardware to do many different things xe dr pham said xe cso this is kind of the genericity that we wanted to mimic xe
also like humans the robot had little help to start it was fed kind of manual set of ordered instructions on how the pieces fit together after that though it was on its own
the robot proceeded in three broad phases spread out over minutes seconds
first like humans it took some time to stare at the pieces scattered before it
the robot spent few seconds photographing the scene and matching each part to the one modeled in its xe cmanual xe
then over more than minutes the robot devised plan that would allow it to quickly assemble the chair without its arms knocking into each other or into the various parts
finally it put the plan in motion over the course of nearly nine minutes the robot used grippers to pick up the wooden pins from tray and force sensors at its xe cwrists xe to detect when the pins searching in spiral pattern finally slid into their holes working in unison the arms then pressed the sides of the chair frame together
of course the robot didn xe succeed right away there were several failed attempts along the way and researchers tweaked the system before the robot was finally able to assemble the chair on its own
the accomplishment was the culmination of three years of work but the team is eager to see what else it can automate dr pham said
with the help of experts in artificial intelligence the researchers may be able to create robot that can build chair by following spoken directions or by watching someone else do it first he said or maybe he said they xe ll eventually develop one that assembles furniture in way that is truly human by ignoring the manual altogether

ottawa xe john tory the mayor of the only city outside the united states to make the list of finalists for amazon xe second headquarters displayed some typical canadian modesty on thursday toronto mr tory said had only xe cmade the playoffs xe
but regardless of the outcome the announcement that the city remains contender showed how much progress toronto and the surrounding region have made in establishing themselves as major technology center
nine communities in the toronto region put forward joint bid for the headquarters those towns are already home to major google engineering operation major artificial intelligence research center and quantum computing institute general motors is adding about software engineers to the area who will among other things develop systems for self driving cars and thomson reuters has made toronto technology hub move that could create jobs and unit of google xe parent company alphabet is developing plans to turn derelict portion of toronto xe waterfront into high tech city of the future
amazon offered few details on thursday about how it had come up with its finalists unlike several other finalists the region offered no tax or other incentives but mr tory said he believed that the area had two important virtues
one is canada xe immigration policy mr tory said that when he was recently in new york he found great deal of interest among american executives in canada xe relatively new immigration program that gives visas to certain skilled workers within two weeks that xe light speed compared with the complicated american system and unlike the united states canada does not limit how many of those visas can be issued each year
in sharp contrast to president trump xe efforts to limit the entry of people from some predominately muslim countries into the united states prime minister justin trudeau has repeatedly emphasized that canada is open to people of all religions and backgrounds
xe cwe xe re able to attract the best and the brightest from around the world xe mr tory said
toronto xe second asset he said is its publicly funded university and college system the university of waterloo has long been recognized as one of north america xe top technology schools and the university of toronto is major center for research in artificial intelligence as part of the area xe amazon pitch the province of ontario has increased funding for artificial intelligence programs at its universities by million canadian dollars or about million
xe cwe have talent pool and we have the educational policies to make sure the pipeline is full xe mr tory said
but the toronto area also has potentially unattractive feature ever escalating prices both for homes and for commercial real estate its bid proposes several potential sites for amazon xe second headquarters among them the largely abandoned docklands that include the google related redevelopment plan
frank scarpitti the mayor of markham ontario which is already home to operations of ibm and the chip maker amd dismissed the idea that land and housing prices could be deal breaker he noted that several other finalists including new york had similar or higher costs
soon after the announcement kathleen wynne the premier of ontario appointed ed clark the former president and chief executive of the toronto dominion bank to coordinate the province xe reply
mr tory said the cities would probably have to wait for amazon xe next move before taking any action of their own
xe cwe don xe know what they xe re expecting from us xe he said xe cthere has been no playbook or playoff schedule supplied to the finalists xe

the city and state sent loads of data to amazon during its search for new headquarters offering peek into the valuable information the company collected during the process
by karen weise
updated feb amazon said it was canceling plans to build corporate campus in new york city after the deal had run into fierce opposition from local lawmakers who criticized providing subsidies to one of the world xe most valuable companies
an avocado at whole foods costs columbia university handed out graduate degrees in computer science over the past three years and potential land parcels in long island city are zoned for light manufacturing
new york provided all of these data points and thousands more to amazon as part of its successful bid to woo the tech giant to town
on monday new york city posted online the page proposal it submitted along with new york state to amazon in march the city quickly took the file down saying it should have checked with its partners before posting it because the document included proprietary information but the new york times downloaded the document before it was taken off the public website
the proposal shows the types of data some rarely available publicly that the company amassed from cities across the country as part of its search for second headquarters
in the end amazon chose long island city in queens and arlington va for two new headquarters but more than cities put in initial bids for the project and of them provided amazon with more information when they made amazon xe shortlist each submitted valuable research that the company can mine in the future for picking satellite offices warehouse locations or research hubs
when joseph parilla fellow at the metropolitan policy program at the brookings institution first scrolled through new york xe submission which the times asked him to review one word kept flying out his mouth xe cwow xe
mr parilla who researches economic development was amazed at the level of detail and hard to find data the city had provided xe cwe are doing project right now that if we had access to amazon xe database it would make our life so much easier xe mr parilla said
an amazon spokesman adam sedo said that most of the information the company received was publicly available and that economic development offices regularly provided such data to companies looking to locate in an area
here is look at what amazon obtained and how the company did it
in september amazon put out an eight page request for proposals from cities and states the first round of responses from locations included glossy marketing pitches with slick graphics and broad proposals for why amazon should come to their regions new york xe first proposal included rendering of building with amazon xe logo shining in the skyline
after amazon announced its shortlist in january it gave cities page request for information that required far more precision and was more about practicalities than flash it asked cities to respond by early march with huge text document punctuated only with few maps
in its first proposal new york offered to use eminent domain to help amazon get necessary land and highlighted four city neighborhoods for new amazon headquarters including in the world trade center complex and the redeveloped farley post office in midtown west amazon ended up selecting long island city and there are no plans to use eminent domain
the main criteria amazon laid out in the initial request like airport connectivity and education levels were relatively easy to come by mr parilla said he could pull it together in matter of few hours on his own
the unique information in the first round of submissions was the details on available real estate sites and incentive programs said richard florida professor at the university of toronto
new york xe second response included doze ns of pages of de tailed information on outcomes from the city xe educational institutions that the document says is not all publicly available xe csome of this info only exists within organizations xe mr parilla said xe cit would be hard to coordinate all of that gathering xe
amazon asked for detailed information on the availability of machine learning specialists user experience designers and hardware engineers xe three jobs critical to its growth the proposal says that new york university awarded undergraduate and graduate degrees in integrated digital media which includes design in the past three years amazon also learned that columbia university has outreach programs for stem programs for schools in the bronx and upper manhattan that reached students last year and that columbia planned to expand the offering
the data while not flashy is core to the ability to understand where the best pool of potential employees live and could be developed which drove the search for the new headquarters
xe cduring the process it became clear to us that the overriding criteria was going to be the ability to find and attract talent xe jay carney senior vice president at amazon said in an interview immediately after the company announced its plans for new york and virginia
most of it xe but the company got the city and state to pull it all together
new york xe response includes at least footnotes documenting data sources that show how much information was publicly available some of it was very basic new york had to detail for example that the state government has bicameral legislature xe the senate and assembly xe whose officials are elected to two year terms and that year olds attend the city xe free full day pre programs and it laid out the zoning designations for dozens of individual parcels
while that information is public it is spread across dozens of sources and can be time consuming to compile the new york response has tables from federal census reports published studies city databases and news articles
amazon also asked cities to provide the costs of xe cgallon of milk loaf of whole wheat bread and an avocado xe at local whole foods the organic grocer that amazon owns
as mr parilla said xe cit xe like why do the work when somebody else can do it xe
having that information compiled in one place can let amazon move quickly in the future mr florida said the company can go back to cities and say xe cwe didn xe put hq in your neighborhood but we have this really good idea for an amp hub xe mr florida said xe cyou have this great site here and you told us what incentives you would have xe and push them to act
mr sedo the amazon spokesman said the company had already used information gleaned from the first round as it looks to future growth for example amazon learned about program in new orleans that lets companies inform classes taught at community colleges which made amazon think it could be good place to build fulfillment center with robotics that require specialized skills to maintain and operate he said real estate information while valuable can change quickly as cities develop
xe cyou now have this database that you can go back to xe mr parilla said xe cyou have so much more information xe

the big ideas
robots may be better than nothing but they still won xe be enough
by sherry turkle
professor in the program in science technology and society at
years ago spoke with year old girl who was considering the idea of having computer companion in the future and she described the upside to me it xe not that the robot she xe imagined vastly more sophisticated siri was so inspiring it xe that she xe already found people to be so disappointing and now for the first time she explained me people have options back then thought her comments seemed prescient now find them timely
xe cthere are people who have tried to make friends but stumbled so badly that they xe ve given up xe she said xe cso when they hear this idea of robots as companions well xe xa it xe not like robot has the mind to walk away or leave you or anything like that xe
this girl had grown up in the time of siri conversational object presented as an empathy machine xe thing that could understand her and so it seemed natural to her that other machines would expand the range of conversation but there is something she may have been too young to understand xe or like lot of us xe prone to forget when we talk to machines these robots can perform empathy in conversation about your friend your mother your child or your lover but they have no experience of any of these relationships machines have not known the arc of human life they feel nothing of the human loss or love we describe to them their conversations about life occupy the realm of the as if
yet through our interactions with these machines we seem to ignore this fact we act as though the emotional ties we form with them will be reciprocal and real as though there is right kind of emotional tie that can be formed with objects that have no emotions at all
in our manufacturing and marketing of these machines we encourage children to develop an emotional tie that is sure to lead to an empathic dead end on top of this it has become fashionable for psychologists to critique empathy unique form of human connection just at time when we are embarking on relationships with objects with none to give the coincidence is too convenient children will lose the ability to have empathy if they relate too consistently with objects that cannot form empathic ties
technology challenges us to look at our human values we can try to use technology to cure parkinson xe or alzheimer xe which would be blessing but that blessing is not reason to move from artificial brain enhancement to artificial intimacy
and yet that is the kind of talk that one hears these days the narrative begins with the idea that companionate robots would be xe cbetter than nothing xe better because there aren xe enough people to teach love and tend to people but that idea quickly shifts into another robots would be better than most anything unlike people they would not abandon you or get sick and die they might not be capable of love but they won xe break your heart
from better than nothing to better than anything these are stations on our voyage to forgetting what it means to be human but the forgetting begins long before we have robot companion in place it begins when we even think of putting one in place to build the robots we must first rebuild ourselves as people ready to be their companions
in early may was filmed for documentary about technology and humanity the director bennett miller shows me video clips from interviews he xe done with some of the world xe most famous futurists danny hillis ray kurzweil kevin esvelt again and again hear there are not enough people to care for the elderly naturally robots will do that job there is an epidemic of loneliness robots will make this thing of the past people crave immortality our re embodiment in machines will make that possible and above all this it is our nature our human nature to evolve toward our maximum potential it is our human destiny to evolve into the superior cognitive beings of robotic future
xe ve heard it before but still xe rattled stand accused by my happy technologist colleagues and their unrelenting enthusiasm accused of what species chauvinism suppose my colleagues make assumptions about the future of being human with which am not comfortable first that it is our human nature to want to evolve toward being more than human and ultimately immortal the steps to get there are small we will want to cure brain diseases and from there we will want to have superior brains and from there we will want our brains to live forever am an outsider to these cheerful pronouncements which are not so much conversation about human values as technological ideology about what posthuman values should be
ironically to deny the need for death is to deny the humanness of having real conversations about it technologists presented us with artificial intelligence and in the end it made us look differently and more critically at the kind of intelligence that only people have it is an intelligence that is tempered with knowledge of our bodies of our place in families and history now science goes step further and presents us with artificial intimacy yet another form of again this is an intimacy that does not make room for human empathy or what human beings in their bodies experience as the fear of death loneliness illness pain we diminish as the seeming empathy of the machine increases it is technology forcing us to forget what we know about life
in life you are struck by the importance of presence of the small moments of meaning the miracle of your child xe breath the feelings of deep human connection when you are thinking about technology your mind is not on all of that we program machines to appear more empathic being human today is about the struggle to remain genuinely empathic ourselves to remember why it matters to remember what we cherish
these days to be human is to keep one xe mind on the glory that one is

facebook has always sold data to advertisers and it probably always will
by michal kosinski
mr kosinski is an assistant professor at stanford university xe graduate school of business
in recent weeks facebook confronted yet another privacy scandal in light of leaked court documents suggesting that its staff discussed the idea of selling user data as long ago as facebook director of developer platforms and programs konstantinos papamiltiadis responded xe cto be clear facebook has never sold anyone xe data xe it was the same denial that mark zuckerberg issued before the senate in april xe cwe do not sell data to advertisers we don xe sell data to anyone xe
as data scientist am shocked that anyone continues to believe this claim each time you click on facebook ad facebook sells data on you to that advertiser this is such basic property of online targeted advertising that it would be impossible to avoid even if facebook somehow wanted to
or even better let mr zuckerberg explain as he did to the senate in april xe cwhat we allow is for advertisers to tell us who they want to reach and then we do the placement so if an advertiser comes to us and says xe all right am ski shop and want to sell skis to women xe xe xa we can show the ads to the right people without that data ever changing hands and going to the advertiser xe
let xe take closer look at mr zuckerberg xe ski shop example the ski shop pays facebook to show targeted ad to women and sends the women to the ski shop xe website if the women click on the ad mr zuckerberg describes this process as showing xe cthe ads to the right people without that data ever changing hands and going to the advertiser xe but this isn xe true if ski shop pays facebook to show an ad only to women then facebook automatically reveals to the ski shop that all people who clicked on the link must be women
and in practice the advertisers make requests that are much more nuanced they may ask facebook to show their ad to xe cliberal latina women without college education who live in san antonio and recently got married xe and then they might place separate ad that is shown only to xe cconservative african american women with college educations who live in austin and are single xe when you click on an ad and are sent to an advertiser xe website the advertiser knows which ad you saw and thus which bucket you fall in
facebook has lot of data on their users and is eager to monetize it the advertisers are encouraged to selectively target people according to mind boggling range of personal characteristics some such as age gender or location are not overly intimate others such as your political views family size education occupation marital status or interest in gay dating app are highly personal
facebook would even let advertisers target you based on facts that you may not be aware of such as that you are close friend of soccer fan or of someone who got recently engaged in recent study we published my colleagues and discovered that advertisers can target users based on their intimate psychological traits such as personality if you can think of an important personal characteristic there xe good chance it xe targetable on facebook through this ad targeting system facebook discloses facts about you to advertisers in exchange for money every time you click on an ad xe call that xe cselling data xe and bet that you would too
but facebook is extremely clever at dodging this issue when the company argues that it is not selling data but rather selling targeted advertising it xe luring you into semantic trap encouraging you to imagine that the only way of selling data is to send advertisers file filled with user information congress may have fallen for this trap set up by mr zuckerberg but that doesn xe mean you have to the fact that your data is not disclosed in an excel spreadsheet but through click on targeted ad is irrelevant data still changes hands and goes to the advertiser
facebook claiming that it is not selling user data is like bar xe giving away free martini with every bag of peanuts and then claiming that it xe not selling drinks rich user data is facebook xe most prized possession and the company sure isn xe throwing it in for free
importantly this problem is not limited to facebook other big tech companies including google and amazon have similar ad platforms if platform can be used to target specific users then it reveals those users xe data the advertiser could easily create its own data file based on this information or merge the information with any other data it has on customer
the potential for abuse is obvious as we suspected in plenty of groups buy facebook ads to cause trouble or sow discord rather than xe cmerely xe to sell you things if advertisers can effectively buy data about facebook users in the manner xe ve described they can discriminate or target propaganda ever more effectively xe both inside and outside the facebook advertising ecosystem they could even take the information they xe ve gleaned from facebook combine it with advanced machine learning algorithms and build predictive models for other sensitive traits like religious and political views personality intelligence sexual orientation happiness use of drugs or parental separation
to address this problem we need to offer users both transparency and control before being directed to an advertiser xe site users should be told which of their traits were used in targeting them they should also be warned that if they continue these traits will be revealed to the advertiser
facebook cannot be trusted to fix this problem itself would you trust big tobacco xe claims about lung cancer what about big sugar xe claims about obesity then why would you believe what big tech has to say about data privacy markets including the market for consumer data do not work efficiently when company like facebook is allowed to abuse its market position to ignore its users xe rights needs and wishes policymakers have no choice but to step in restore the balance of power and protect citizens xe privacy

paris xe when president emmanuel macron took office he took pains to include two iphones in his official portrait symbol of his penchant for technology millennials throng as he buzzes from one french start up event to the next he has wined and dined the chief executives of the world xe largest tech companies who in turn have vowed to invest billions in france
yet year after mr macron unveiled an aggressive agenda to turn france into xe ca start up nation xe it is unclear if reality has kept pace with his rhetoric while the country has quickly become one of the most talked about destinations in europe for tech companies and start ups france still faces an uphill path in its bid to usurp london as the region xe technology leader
the french president has carefully cultivated tech savvy image promoted steady drumbeat of high profile events and even pushed through raft of economic and labor reforms to make his country more appealing to investors but france continues to lag britain in tech related investments and in the business of artificial intelligence start ups still face challenges in scaling up and lot of seed funding comes from the french government itself
companies have been pledging to do more in france in january for example the chief executives of the world xe biggest technology companies announced billion euros or billion in new investments and the creation of at least jobs in the next five years
those figures are minuscule compared with investment in silicon valley and even london mr macron nevertheless sought to build on france xe momentum on wednesday when he convened tech chief executives for meetings in paris the french president met individually with the facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg and with the leaders of ibm microsoft and uber later wednesday at the xc lys xc xa palace
the official focus of the talks which preceded giant technology and start up conference being held in paris was data privacy the meetings came day after mr zuckerberg faced strident questioning by lawmakers at the european parliament in brussels on privacy failures linked to the cambridge analytica fiasco
facebook has faced barrage of public criticism over its handling of user data and vast powers points mr macron intends to press further on wednesday the president xe office also said that mr macron would have frank discussions with the various chief executives over the taxation of tech companies and fighting the proliferation of rumors and misinformation spreading online the meetings come as french lawmakers are expected to debate additional transparency measures for social media companies like facebook
but mr macron president is also expected to seize the moment to announce more tech related investments in france
xe cclearly there has been macron effect xe said franck sebag paris based partner at the professional services firm ernst amp young who has studied france xe digital trajectory
xe cfew people were even talking about france as tech country few years ago xe mr sebag said xe che xe ignited willingness to invest xe
as president trump pursues an increasingly protectionist agenda for the united states and britain veers away from the european union mr macron has promoted policy of open borders and being business friendly in country that has long had reputation for being anything but multinationals are venturing to create more jobs in france as mr macron overhauls french labor laws despite protests by french workers
symbolic statements like the opening last year of station mammoth incubator project in paris representing france xe start up ambitions have also generated buzz and the government is luring research activity with tax credits worth up to xe xac billion year and other inducements this month mr macron announced france would invest xe xac billion into artificial intelligence research through
venture capital xe once difficult to raise in country where risk taking was long stigmatized xe is flowing more freely venture capital fund raising for start ups rose to xe xac billion last year compared with just xe xac million in according to dealroom research firm that latest figure is more than amounts raised in britain as well as germany and israel which also have major tech hubs
xe cthe is no longer the undisputed capital of european venture capital xe dealroom said in recent report xe ccontinental europe is catching up while france is almost on par already xe
for all the hype france must confront number of longstanding hurdles
while thousands of start ups are being developed in incubators like station the country has only handful of so called unicorns or start ups valued at over billion including the ride sharing service blablacar and the commerce site vente privee com that is measure of how challenging it is to create the next facebook or google here and fledgling companies still face considerable challenges scaling up into bigger sustainable businesses
tech related investments in britain meanwhile surged nearly percent last year to over xe xac billion more than in france germany and sweden combined according to dealroom and though france makes billions in cheap loans and grants available to finance start ups and accelerators through its public investment bank bpifrance critics say that can make it hard to tell if french start ups are competitive
mr macron xe efforts to make france hub for artificial intelligence research have also been slow to make headway britain still has the strongest ecosystem in europe with over firms involved in the technology compared with in france according to asgard capital berlin based venture capital firm
the trend here is shifting though
big businesses are increasingly tallying the advantages especially since mr macron convened chief executives of global companies at an ornate gathering at the palace of versailles in january he told them that he was pursuing strategy to make france more productive and competitive and announced more than xe xac billion in foreign investments including large chunk for tech
ibm announced wednesday it would recruit artificial intelligence experts in france by sap of germany plans to invest xe xac billion in research and development deepmind the london based machine learning company owned by google xe parent alphabet will expand its operations in paris as britain prepares to leave the european union

car wends its way through line of taxis in the las vegas rain carefully steering around tangle of sedans vying for passengers as the black lincoln mkz gets closer the steering wheel saws back and forth but there xe no one in the front seat in fact there xe no one in the car at all
it xe disquieting to be picked up by an empty car and it xe something of milestone inside most autonomous research vehicles cruising public streets there xe minder to keep watchful eye and take control should things go awry but with the mkz there was no human custodian at least not one within view
hundreds of miles away ben shukman software engineer for phantom auto was sitting in front of phalanx of video screens in mountain view calif using live two way video connection along with the kind of steering wheel and pedals usually reserved for video games he was driving the mkz
while major technology and car companies are teaching cars to drive themselves phantom auto is working on remote control systems often referred to as teleoperation that many see as necessary safety feature for the autonomous cars of the future and that future is closer than you might think california will allow companies to test autonomous vehicles without safety driver xe as long as the car can be operated remotely xe starting next month
while technologies ranging from advanced sensors to machine learning are being applied to self driving cars engineers acknowledge that even the most sophisticated vehicles will not be infallible developers of self driving cars from nissan to zoox say such technology may be needed to address xe cedge cases xe xe the unique situations that software programs can xe anticipate fallen tree sinkhole string of strange pylons flash flood fire or some other obstruction on lonely road could make an autonomous car stop safely but then what
what happens when self driving car can xe help itself
xe cwe want to be the onstar for the autonomous industry xe said shai magzimof co founder and the chief executive of phantom auto he pictures the technology his company has developed being used in fleet vehicles robotaxis trucks and even self driving cars owned by individuals
car in need of help would automatically contact phantom auto center where remote operator could use the car xe cameras and sensors to see what was happening then maneuver the vehicle out of trouble the technology prefigures time when most passengers wouldn xe be able to take control for the simple reason that they won xe know how to drive car xe or because the steering wheel and pedals have been removed
it is thorny problem other companies are also trying to solve
nissan one of the first automakers to publicly address situations in which self driving car may be flummoxed by its surroundings has proposed using system called seamless autonomous mobility or it xe partly based on the remote control technology that nasa uses to operate rovers on mars
xe cthe current idea is to draw the new route command onto screen to direct the car xe said maarten sierhuis the director of nissan xe research center in silicon valley
such an approach avoids any possible communications glitches and mr sierhuis said the company was working on more advanced solution but wasn xe ready to discuss it yet
waymo the self driving vehicle unit of google xe parent company alphabet is testing autonomous taxis xe but with an observer in the back seat it is focused on having the car make all the driving decisions but there is system for handling edge cases if waymo vehicle becomes confused xe by say new set of cones or police barricade in the road xe it can request confirmation from remote human specialist once it receives confirmation of what it is sensing the car xe not the remote operator xe then decides how to proceed
the waymo approach ensures that latency xe delay in the communications traffic xe doesn xe compromise the car xe driving behavior by leaving remote operator unable to react in real time
phantom auto xe technology on the other hand uses standard cellular data connection and gps information to link the car and its backup driver the company has even been able to make it work in areas that may have less than perfect service
to accomplish this phantom auto mounted computer the size of hardcover book spiked with antennas and four wireless modems in the trunk the car was outfitted with three video cameras but no lidar or far infrared sensors it xe an arrangement that has already attracted several automotive customers according to the company although because of contractual obligations it could not yet disclose specific clients
where typical autonomous vehicle may drive like timid student driver the phantom car behaved naturally xe after all there was human there he just happened to be sitting in another state
phantom hopes its approach will also reassure passengers by letting them talk to and see the remote operator xe within limits as our distant driver steered the car through heavy traffic in the rain mr magzimof advised against distracting the operator with too many questions xe che xe focused on driving xe
gill pratt chief executive of the toyota research institute said that while he believed autonomous vehicles would need some sort of additional support and assistance systems in rare instances he saw them as xe cnot something people would look forward to using xe
mr pratt also pointed out that teleoperation faced several hurdles ranging from the limited availability of wireless networks to the time it takes for remote operators to become xe csituationally aware xe xe informed not just of the immediate problem but important context including the location or weather or any other variable that someone in the driver xe seat would already know
kathy winter the general manager of intel xe autonomous driving group said that because of these limitations her team was making every effort to xe cmake sure the vehicle never gets into situation where this would be necessary xe she noted that redundant systems xe including multiple sensors high resolution maps crowdsourced data and vehicle to vehicle communications xe would ensure that the self driving cars of the future would have multiple cues about their surroundings
when pressed developers like zoox admit that autonomous vehicles may never be truly autonomous zoox xe chief executive tim kentley klay acknowledged at senate hearing on self driving cars in january that command centers with humans would be necessary xe cboth to deal with vehicles if they have an issue but also to deal with customers if they need help xe
in other words if your autonomous sedan gets flat tire someone is still going to have to come out and fix it

new orleans xe these days the most natural question to ask about television series set in the future is simple one so how bad does it get
the success of shows like xe cwestworld xe xe cthe handmaid xe tale xe and xe cblack mirror xe indicate that dystopias or at least deep discomfort are resonating with viewers xe cthe first xe beau willimon xe hulu series about the space program in the not too distant debuting friday is bit of curveball
starring sean penn and natascha mcelhone as an astronaut and private sector aerospace mogul at work on the first manned mission to mars the show explores high level ambition and aspiration mr willimon has plumbed the dark sides of these all too human traits before through the manipulative and unpleasant power brokers that populated his netflix series xe chouse of cards xe and his plays xe cfarragut north xe which became the film xe cthe ides of march xe and xe cthe parisian woman xe here it seems he xe reflecting sincere if guarded faith in our better natures
the optimism of frontiersmanship the desire to boldly go where no one has gone before has long been fascination for mr willimon
xe ci xe ve always been interested in space and adventure travels xe he said over the phone recently xe cnot just space but also tales of people pushing themselves to extremes to their limits whether it xe climbing mountain or going to the ocean depths or shackleton trying to traverse antarctica xe
xe csome of these desires are almost irrational xe he added xe cbecause there really is no way to explain why someone would place themselves in that much risk and peril in order to get to this place that doesn xe necessarily even have practical benefit other than the accomplishment itself xe
mr willimon began work on the optimistic xe cthe first xe shortly before leaving xe chouse of cards xe after its fourth season his main character tom hagerty mr penn in his first major television role is decidedly different protagonist than the machiavellian politician frank underwood of xe chouse of cards xe veteran flyboy hagerty is bit of swashbuckler but torn between his daughter xe newfound yet shaky stability and the tantalizing skies
hagerty xe emotional foil laz ingram ms mcelhone is cerebral but slightly awkward stem visionary all clockwork brains and fierce drive frustrated by the tiresome bureaucracies that throw roadblocks in her path to the stars
another star though inanimate is the show xe setting new orleans wasn xe initially factor during mr willimon xe conceptual and writing process but once louisiana bolstered tax credit program for film and tv production that had briefly been in flux the city xe presence began seeping into the creator xe writing
xe chere xe place that xe teeming with life in every sense xe said mr willimon who also had new orleans set play xe clower ninth xe conversation among tenuous survivors trapped on rooftop in the aftermath of the floods from hurricane katrina xe cfrom this sort of swirling biological chaos of swamps and the delta and the ocean to the swirling human chaos of city that xe so rich in culture and history and every sort of person you can imagine xe
hagerty xe troubled daughter played by anna jacoby heron has pivotal scene set at the pearl longstanding bohemian art space in the bywater neighborhood which just happened to have spaceship shaped piece of discarded industrial metal in its backyard after finding himself there at party mr willimon wrote it in
similar thing happened with hagerty xe house key location in the show after searching the elegant garden district to no avail willimon happened to be back at the edge of bywater looking across the mississippi and found it two story house with balcony that feels like ship xe prow where an explorer might look out at expanses of water and sky and grassy levee and see the edge of the world xe ceverything started to click xe he said xe cit suddenly became tom hagerty xe house almost instantly and started writing to the architecture xe
and the river itself the wide earth colored force that has both cradled and menaced the below sea level city for centuries is the site of tragedy essential to the plot
as befits show about the future xe cthe first xe is full of neat gadgetry and believable technology like reliable self driving cars augmented reality and google glass ish personal communication hubs the only thing that seems far fetched is the implication that by listening to voice mail messages will have made comeback new orleans was also convenient to real life nasa facilities like the john stennis space center rocket testing facility and summer space camp site on the mississippi border and the lyndon johnson space center in houston actors as well as writers and production designers put in hours there and with the consultants christopher ferguson and michael lopez alegria both retired nasa astronauts some scenes were even shot at stennis
xe ci think we all recognize whether it xe in ourselves or in others this thing that is the explorer the wanderer the person who wants to take themselves out of either their own or society xe comfort zone xe mr penn said
spending time with astronauts xe particularly chris hadfield the first canadian to walk in space and probably the first person of any nationality to record david bowie song there too xe unlocked new level of understanding for mr penn he zeroed in on the way mr hadfield spoke about the beauty of spacewalk the way the elite military people and scientists who went to space would use words like xe cimagine xe
xe cto hear him talk about it it xe universe broadening xe he said
for lisagay hamilton it was the emotional rather than the technical details that she hoped to understand she spoke with the aerospace engineer jeanette epps in preparation for her role as kayla price xe who like ms epps is black female astronaut xe ci wanted to speak to someone who looked like me and who potentially had similar experience of the world xe ms hamilton said the conversation was grounding she said one of the topics that the two women spent time on was death xe ci mean here you are actually going into profession where you could die and not come back to earth xe she said
price butts up against some of the uglier realities that perhaps no surprise still plague us in even hopeful future in this way she provides the flip side to mr willimon xe belief that the impulses that propel us to the stars are timeless so too are the ones that drag us back to earth
xe cit xe both noble pursuit and it has potentially really damaging and selfish aspects to it as well xe he said xe cand think those two things go hand in hand you can applaud someone who discovered the north pole but you can ask yourself the question well at what cost what did that person put their family through how much ambition was part of that it wasn xe purely selfless act xe

congestion pricing was supposed to be xe can idea whose time has come xe for new york city but in budget deal announced on friday in albany state leaders not only punted on the policy but also may have undermined its viability in new york and across the country for generation
everybody agrees that congestion in manhattan xe central business district has become unacceptable too many vehicles on the road and too few people in more efficient transportation options such as public transit congestion pricing addresses this problem by making it much more expensive to drive in the city people will do less of it and the new revenue will improve public transit and make using it more appealing xe win win that has proved effective in singapore london and stockholm
in mayor michael bloomberg proposed congestion pricing but politics got in the way in the interceding decade the congestion problem grew much worse and our transit system has suffered crippling consistent breakdowns with the pressure mounting gov andrew cuomo appointed panel of experts who urged albany to implement congestion pricing in new york city in three phases
the recommendation was well received and the governor blessed it xe cthere is no doubt that we must finally address the undeniable growing problem of traffic congestion in manhattan xe central business district xe he said it looked like congestion pricing might become reality
but of course politics has intervened state leaders have tweaked the plan so that it will raise revenue but limit political risk xe by excluding personal cars from paying at least for now xe and therefore have negligible impact on congestion
congestion is caused by all vehicles not just fraction of them the plan arbitrarily divides the vehicles that ply our streets into for hire vehicles and applies surcharge xe per trip for taxis for for hire shared for hire xe and lets all other vehicles go free analysis from charles komanoff transportation expert who contributed to the fix nyc report finds that without congestion pricing on all vehicles xe cthe time savings from reduced traffic congestion drops by at least percent the revenues available to improve transit drop by percent or more as well xe
the real challenge for city streets is to move people not cars efficiently not only does albany xe plan treat significant fraction of vehicles as if they were invisible and took up no space it also underplays an incredibly salient distinction xe how many people are in vehicle xe by lumping all for hire vehicles together if one person alone in car is bad and it is then two people in car is better three is better still getting lots of people into bus or subway is the holy grail of congestion reduction while the albany plan will charge pooled passengers smaller surcharge it doesn xe go far enough to recognize the enormous benefits of ride sharing and microtransit
in fact on percentage basis riders in shared trip vehicles will be paying higher tax than those who choose to ride alone and in some cases the total tax per vehicle will be higher too during morning and evening commutes via transports six people per vehicle the collective surcharge on those vehicles will be larger than for lone riders in other for hire vehicles and infinitely more than for the person driving his or her own car without charge
independent research conducted in san francisco finds that the regular uber and lyft services average passengers per vehicle yet neither of them will get tax break because the services aren xe registered as xe cshared for hire xe seventy three percent of people who commute in their personal cars travel alone and won xe be paying fee at all
we need to do more in addition to albany taxing all vehicles and providing strong incentives to vehicles that are transporting more people per square yard there is complementary policy work to be done by the city of new york it should increase the cost of on street parking where personal cars lie immobile percent of the time obstructing flow we must allocate more space to modes that provide more throughput of people bike bus and high occupancy vehicle lanes
it has taken us years to get congestion pricing back into the public discourse and in those years technology has transformed what is happening on our streets hailing and microtransit apps have introduced convenient way to get around town and increased the number of vehicles in the city the rise of on demand delivery has made shopping and meals click to order and given rise to an epidemic of double parking had we instituted congestion pricing back then the shape and use of these services would be wholly different today
over the next years we xe re probably going to see the introduction of self driving cars whoever owns one is going to send it out to run all sorts of errands many of them with no one in the car those empty personal cars aren xe going to care about sitting in traffic we need to charge price that makes owners think twice about sending out car during peak times with few or no people inside
regardless of the innovation the challenge remains the same moving metal boxes through limited street space while allowing maximum access for people and goods getting the market signals right for parking congestion curb access infrastructure and public transit matters more than ever we shouldn xe have waited years to get to this point we can xe build our way out of it
this is the moment to improve the livability and economic viability of new york city let xe do it right right now

san francisco xe the ride hailing service lyft has agreed to alliances with just about anyone working on driverless car technology its latest partnership aims to make its autonomous vehicle technology available to any car manufacturer
lyft said wednesday that it had reached deal with magna international one of the world xe biggest auto suppliers to jointly develop and manufacture self driving car systems
the companies said they will work together to introduce autonomous vehicles to lyft xe ride hailing network at the same time magna can sell the driverless car technology to any customer xe including other technology companies
magna also said it would invest million in lyft xe latest fund raising round lifting the san francisco based company xe valuation to billion
the partnership reflects lyft xe open arms approach to autonomous vehicles
lyft has opened its ride hailing network to other companies working on self driving cars including ford and general motors major lyft investor so they can gain real world experience by picking up passengers and collecting data
uber lyft xe main rival has been developing self driving technology mostly on its own waymo lyft partner is slowly introducing its own ride hailing service using autonomous chrysler pacifica minivans equipped with waymo xe own hardware and software
the hype over self driving cars has made development of the technology challenging for some traditional automakers car companies face huge salaries for top artificial intelligence engineers and limited access to data and key components the competitive landscape is so charged that it has already given birth to at least one high profile lawsuit
as result automakers are confronting choice pay big for technology start up or risk falling behind last year ford announced it would invest billion in argo ai an artificial intelligence start up focused on developing autonomous vehicle technology gm acquired cruise for an estimated billion in cash stock and incentive packages in the same year it invested million in lyft
after lagging behind uber lyft has recently made concerted push into self driving cars the company opened research facility in palo alto calif and has aggressively recruited engineers
it also has major asset for self driving technology xe ride hailing network picking up and dropping off passengers million times week this provides lyft with customer base to introduce and test the vehicles and way to collect information that can be used to xe ctrain xe autonomous cars
but raj kapoor lyft xe chief strategy officer said it would be few years before truly autonomous vehicles were ready for the road
xe ci believe this relationship will get us there faster xe mr kapoor said
magna canadian auto parts maker already supplies wide range of driver assist technology to its customers including system for staying in lanes automatic emergency braking and rearview cameras it also builds entire vehicles for customers like mercedes benz bmw and jaguar xe capability that has made the company potential partner for new entrant like apple
magna has already been working on hardware for self driving cars including radar and lidar xe an abbreviation for light detection and ranging xe that help the vehicles see the world around them
but magna said the partnership with lyft would be essential to helping it push further into autonomous vehicles combining its automotive and manufacturing experience with lyft xe ride network to better understand the many situations that self driving car will encounter
xe cthe question isn xe whether autonomous vehicles are going to happen but how long the transition is xe said swamy kotagiri magna xe chief technology officer
under the partnership lyft would take the lead in developing self driving car technology while magna would oversee manufacturing of the systems the two companies would share the development costs and the resulting intellectual property
lyft compared its strategy of operating its own self driving cars as well as welcoming driverless cars from other companies to the way amazon is both retailer selling products to customers directly and an online virtual mall providing space for other companies to sell goods on the site

the recent tribulations of facebook which has lurched from crisis to crisis over the last year most recently over the handling of users xe personal data has pushed few of the industry xe most prominent names to speak out against the company
marc benioff the chief executive of salesforce com has compared the deleterious effects of social media to those of tobacco and alcohol and has called for more regulation of those tech companies timothy cook apple xe chief executive has also suggested new regulation protecting personal data might be in order for businesses like facebook
xe ci think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well crafted regulation is necessary xe mr cook said recently at an event in china referring to facebook xe recent problems
but don xe expect long lineup of other industry leaders to speak out any time soon
although technology companies have their differences spirit of comity prevails among its leaders in moments of crisis for example technology chiefs have mostly kept quiet about uber xe travails xe from its efforts to sidestep law enforcement to pedestrian death caused by one of its self driving cars xe even if they might express their opinions privately
representatives from companies as varied as amazon microsoft and slack declined to comment for this story part of the silence people in the industry say comes from desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma xe knowing that they too may one day face the buzz saw of public censure
others say companies have little moral standing to criticize facebook xe practices when they have themselves relied on the social network to acquire customers using the same ad targeting tools that rely on personal data that have stirred up so much controversy in the context of politics
xe ci think we just have to acknowledge the entire industry xe complicity with what xe happening with facebook xe said glenn kelman chief executive of redfin an internet real estate firm xe cit xe almost like we xe re inspector renault in xe casablanca xe where we say we xe re shocked shocked with what xe happening and then moment later someone hands us our winnings xe
xe cwe xe ve all been advertising avidly on facebook xe mr kelman added
many companies are also linked to facebook through partnerships professional organizations and worldview about the power of data that is not all that different from that of mark zuckerberg the chief executive of facebook
xe cit has been really hard for executives to turn their back on the gold mine of big data even in the face of compelling arguments to do so xe said roger mcnamee an early investor in facebook and mentor of mr zuckerberg xe before becoming one of the company xe most vocal detractors xe cthe who are stepping forward here are taking the long view xe
vanessa chan spokeswoman for facebook declined to comment
there are many critics of facebook in silicon valley they include former tech workers venture capitalists and entrepreneurs like brian acton who became billionaire when facebook acquired whatsapp messaging company he helped found xe cit is time deletefacebook xe mr acton posted on twitter last month
but there are few active corporate leaders in silicon valley who have taken stand most of the handful of chiefs who have spoken out against facebook have long been forthright on the topic of privacy it is no coincidence that their businesses do not rely on the collection of personal data to the same degree that most internet companies do mr cook of apple which makes the vast majority of its revenue from the sale of devices has for years declared that xe cwhen an online service is free you xe re not the customer xe you xe re the product xe
steve dowling spokesman for apple declined to comment
when asked about the facebook xe difficulties at an event in china recently ginni rometty chief executive of ibm said companies needed to give their users better control over their personal information xe cginni has long believed that individuals or customers own their data xe not platforms xe said edward barbini spokesman for ibm
noah theran spokesman for the internet association trade group that counts facebook and salesforce among its members though not apple and ibm said maintaining privacy and security was top priority for internet companies
xe cinternet companies comply with wide variety of data privacy and security laws and regulations that are actively enforced by the and state attorneys general xe mr theran said xe ctrust and comfort with our products and services is essential to thriving internet and the internet industry is committed to providing people with information and tools to make informed choices about how their personal information is used seen and shared online xe
another tech leader elon musk chief executive of tesla and spacex said recently on twitter that none of his companies advertise on the social network and vowed to take down the official facebook pages for tesla and spacex
xe cit xe not political statement and didn xe do this because someone dared me to do it xe he wrote xe cjust don xe like facebook gives me the willies sorry xe
mr mcnamee the early facebook investor believes more industry leaders should speak out partly because he predicts the united states can and should eventually adopt more stringent regulations akin to those emerging in europe
xe ccompanies that get ahead of that curve xe he said xe cwill be way more successful than those who can pretend they can sustain the old model xe

the mechanics of elections that attract the most attention are casting and counting snafus with voting machines and ballots and allegations of hacking and fraud but jeff jonas prominent data scientist is focused on something else the integrity updating and expansion of voter rolls
xe cas dove into the subject it grew on me the complexity and relevance of the problem xe he said
as result mr jonas has played geeky behind the scenes role in encouraging turnout for the midterm elections on tuesday
for the last four years mr jonas has used his software for multistate project known as electronic registration information center that identifies eligible voters and cleans up voter rolls since its founding in the nonprofit center has identified million people who are eligible but unregistered to vote as well as million registered voters who have moved appear on more than one list or have died
xe ci have no doubt that more people are voting as result of eric xe said john lindback former senior election administrator in oregon and alaska who was the center xe first executive director
voter rolls like nearly every aspect of elections are politically charged issue eric brought together by the pew charitable trusts is meant to play it down the middle it was started largely with professional election administrators from both red and blue states
but the election officials recognized that their headaches often boiled down to data handling challenge then mr jonas added his technology which has been developed and refined for decades it is artificial intelligence software fine tuned for spotting and resolving identities whether people or things
xe cevery time you get two pieces of junk mail from the same place that xe an entity resolution problem xe mr jonas said xe cthey xe re missed but entity resolution problems are everywhere xe
shortly after the election administrators tapped him mr jonas sketched out how his technology might be applied to their challenges and they needed to take very different path than another data matching initiative the interstate voter registration crosscheck system which was already underway
crosscheck was begun in led by ron thornburgh then the republican secretary of state in kansas and later championed by kris kobach the republican secretary of state who is running for governor of kansas
crosscheck was portrayed as program to root out voter fraud but election administrators and experts agree that voter fraud is rarity voter rights advocates long argued that crosscheck was partisan effort to purge voter rolls of likely democratic voters and recent study by the brennan center for justice found rising rate of people being removed from voter rolls
last year researchers at stanford harvard university of pennsylvania and microsoft research concluded that crosscheck produced flood of false positives raising the risk of disenfranchising legal voters and an investigation by propublica found crosscheck was riddled with security flaws today the crosscheck system is little used essentially dormant
eric by contrast was meant to both increase voter access and clean up voter rolls member states have to agree to specific steps to do both
xe cif we didn xe do that eric would become another politicized tool xe said david becker former head of the elections program at pew and the executive director of the center for election innovation and research
the organization xe reach has grown gradually and its members now include the district of columbia and states both traditionally democratic ones like connecticut and illinois and republican ones like louisiana and missouri
from each member the group collects minimum of voter registration and motor vehicle license data the software mr jonas and his team developed digests and links that data and combines it with other information like postal change of address lists some states contribute other data
any private personal information including date of birth driver xe license and social security numbers receive one way encryption xe chash xe for privacy xe scrambled into string of numbers and characters which cannot be read by humans
the software finds people wherever they are xe cit connects the dots for us xe said shane hamlin executive director of the center xe cit xe actionable data xe
among the actions required by member states is to mail out notifications to people identified as eligible but unregistered follow up research in some states concluded that to percent of those contacted had later registered to vote high response rate for direct mailings mr hamlin said that rate suggests million to million of the million people notified became voters though they could have signed up for other reasons
the software is not flawless couple of state administrators said determining person xe current address can be difficult according to the brennan center study and like any technology tool much depends on how it is used despite the safeguards
but the states using the eric software generally say false positives are few and returned unopened mail xe evidence of wrong address xe is much reduced and the outreach seems to be working colorado had the highest percentage of eligible registered voters in the country in at percent up from percent in
xe cfor my money eric is big part of that xe said judd choate colorado xe director of elections xe ceric has been game changer in elections for those of us in it xe
one thing mr jonas finds satisfying is that eric has two person staff with one tending the constantly growing database of more than million records
xe cit xe not beholden to an army of experts xe he said
mr jonas is advancing the technology in start up senzing which he founded and spun out of ibm in he joined ibm after it bought his previous start up systems research and development in
senzing has no headquarters its full time employees work from wherever they please following their founder xe lead mr jonas has long been road warrior but recently he decided to go further xe lifestyle experiment he calls xe cfull nomad xe and xe cextreme minimalism xe
he is selling his home in venice calif and jettisoning nearly all his possessions he has digitized family photos papers awards anything that stirs memories of his experience and stored them on dropbox his clothes are laundered stored and sent ahead to him to his travel destinations by dufl travel valet service on sunday mr jonas completed his st ironman triathlon xe swimming miles biking miles and running full mile marathon xe in florida
xe ci xe unencumbered so can focus on stuff that matters xe mr jonas said

it xe not easy to encourage the ethical use of artificial intelligence but here are recommendations
by cade metz
about seven years ago three researchers at the university of toronto built system that could analyze thousands of photos and teach itself to recognize everyday objects like dogs cars and flowers
the system was so effective that google bought the tiny start up these researchers were only just getting off the ground and soon their system sparked technological revolution suddenly machines could xe csee xe in way that was not possible in the past
this made it easier for smartphone app to search your personal photos and find the images you were looking for it accelerated the progress of driverless cars and other robotics and it improved the accuracy of facial recognition services for social networks like facebook and for the country xe law enforcement agencies
but soon researchers noticed that these facial recognition services were less accurate when used with women and people of color activists raised concerns over how companies were collecting the huge amounts of data needed to train these kinds of systems others worried these systems would eventually lead to mass surveillance or autonomous weapons
how should we as society deal with these issues many have asked the question not everyone can agree on the answers google sees things differently from microsoft few thousand google employees see things differently from google the pentagon has its own vantage point
this week at the new work summit hosted by the new york times conference attendees worked in groups to compile list of recommendations for building and deploying ethical artificial intelligence the results are included here
but even the existence of this list sparked controversy some attendees who have spent years studying these issues questioned whether group of randomly selected people were the best choice for deciding the future of artificial intelligence
one thing is for sure the discussion will only continue in the months and years to come
transparency companies should be transparent about the design intention and use of their technology
disclosure companies should clearly disclose to users what data is being collected and how it is being used
privacy users should be able to easily opt out of data collection
diversity technology should be developed by inherently diverse teams
bias companies should strive to avoid bias in by drawing on diverse data sets
trust organizations should have internal processes to self regulate the misuse of have chief ethics officer ethics board etc
accountability there should be common set of standards by which companies are held accountable for the use and impact of their technology
collective governance companies should work together to self regulate the industry
regulation companies should work with regulators to develop appropriate laws to govern the use of

no old line company embraced the digital wave with more gusto than general electric the industrial giant spent billions hired thousands of software engineers and even created image morphing television ads to recast itself as xe digital industrial company xe
the scope of xe digital ambitions were put on full display in when the company set up ge digital as its own business within the industrial conglomerate jeffrey immelt then chief executive boldly declared xe goal to become xe ctop software company xe by
today there are no such ambitions the spending at ge digital is being slashed amid layoffs and sharply narrowed aims at under john flannery who became chief executive last august
last november mr flannery told investors that expenses at ge digital would be cut this year by more than percent or about million while he insisted the digital initiatives at are xe cvery key xe to the company he added xe cwe want much more focused strategy xe
is now struggling with problems in its big power generation business which badly misjudged the electric power market and lingering uncertainties about the liabilities of its finance arm ge capital those two immediate concerns xe along with how one of its engines made with france xe safran was involved this week in southwest airlines accident xe will likely get the most attention from investors when reports its first quarter results on friday
but the rethinking of ge digital with its future still under review by mr flannery points to the difficulty of producing modern software for industrial businesses as they adopt digital technology
no one disputes the overarching vision of the so called industrial internet of things xe which includes low cost sensors and flood of data and clever software that should deliver insights to cut costs conserve fuel and design better products faster but the company greatly underestimated the challenges of creating all the software needed to achieve that grand vision said analysts and former managers
xe technical prowess they said lies in designing and manufacturing big machines like power plant turbines jet engines and medical imaging equipment its traditional software skills have been in the specialized programs that control the machines and factory operations ge digital was striking departure into cloud based internet software data analytics and artificial intelligence tools like machine learning
xe cg reached too far outside its expertise and too fast xe said steven winoker an analyst at ubs xe cand it became financial black hole xe
just how much has invested in its digital initiatives is uncertain but it has been several billion dollars in an article last year in the harvard business review mr immelt wrote that in xe cwe put about billion into developing analytics software and machine learning capabilities xe
xe digital effort dates to when mr immelt recruited william ruh an executive at cisco systems later that year the company set up center in san ramon calif east of san francisco at the time mr ruh announced big plans to hire as many as software engineers to write code for the industrial internet
the san ramon work force swelled sharply to in the summer of and to peak of last summer xe before coming down to about after round of cuts earlier this year
during the buildup recruited veteran software managers who had worked at leading tech companies including google microsoft and apple with the cuts at ge digital and its narrowed focus some of them have departed
in its early days the san ramon center concentrated on writing data analysis and modeling software for applications like predicting when gas turbine or jet engine would need maintenance before the machine failed in called that software predix
the product plan later broadened to include cloud based software platform for handling all kinds of sensor and machine data and secure communications from the factory floor to data centers even built its own data centers
the software platform under development was often referred to as an operating system for the industrial internet when the product concept expanded so did the predix brand
today according to former engineers predix has been pared back to mainly set of software tools to help write applications rather than being connected to layers of code for automating data analysis
the priority at ge digital is now on selling products for specific industrial applications sold as offerings in the xe cpredix portfolio xe and tailored for xe roster of existing industrial customers less emphasis is being put on all purpose software for the wider industrial world
in an interview mr ruh described the change at ge digital as xe ca pivot xe rather than retreat xe cwe xe re still percent behind our predix portfolio xe he said
two key products in that portfolio were acquired in september ge digital bought meridium maker of equipment tracking software for million two months later it bought servicemax whose software is used to manage industrial field service workers for million
the current strategy mr ruh said xe cis about industrial apps xe like those it is measured step by step approach but one mr ruh said that capitalizes on xe strengths xe its industry knowledge and deep customer relationships xe and is lifting sales
ge digital remains large player in an increasingly crowded field of companies offering industrial internet software of various kinds in different market niches the entrants include the big cloud suppliers like amazon microsoft and google major business software companies like oracle sap ibm and sas institute xe industrial peers such as siemens honeywell and abb and start ups like iot uptake and foghorn systems
the opportunity for analysts said centers on its longstanding relationships with customers and selling to them and so far only percent of its industrial customers are using predix portfolio products the company said
the new york power authority the nation xe largest state owned utility is one of them the utility is working with ge digital to build apps that improve the efficiency of its power generation and distribution network in pilot projects the partnership has saved or avoided million in costs said gil quiniones chief executive of the state power authority the goal is million in savings over the next decade
but for technology project to help its customers reduce energy consumption the state authority went with start up iot
brian hurst chief analytics officer at exelon utilities large electric utility corporation based in chicago is also working on early stage projects with ge digital mr hurst said the progress was encouraging and he saw no evidence that the cuts at ge digital had affected their joint work
but it is something he is watching closely xe cthe technology is moving so fast xe mr hurst said xe ctoday xe players may not be tomorrow xe players xe
ge digital mr ruh insisted is building business for the long term revenue from the predix portfolio products reached million last year he said and sales are growing rapidly ge digital xe total revenue of billion also includes all of xe traditional industrial software and the unit xe global work force is more than
xe cour approach is heads down xe mr ruh said xe cwe xe re going to show you success xe
for his part mr flannery has consistently declared his support for xe digital industrial vision xe but that does not guarantee the future for ge digital mr flannery is selling off businesses to streamline the company the lighting and railway locomotive divisions are up for sale and others could follow
smaller might not need stand alone digital unit some analysts recommend putting all the software in the industrial divisions like power and aviation closer to customers
xe csan ramon shouldn xe exist xe said scott davis chief executive of melius research an independent financial analysis firm

san francisco xe at conference in silicon valley this week mark zuckerberg facebook xe chief executive vowed that his company would xe keep building xe despite swirl of questions around the way it has dealt with misinformation and the personal data of its users
that is certainly true in the important area of artificial intelligence which mr zuckerberg says can help the social media giant deal with some of those problems
facebook is opening new labs in seattle and pittsburgh after hiring three and robotics professors from the university of washington and carnegie mellon university the company hopes these seasoned researchers will help recruit and train other experts in the two cities mike schroepfer facebook xe chief technology officer said in an interview
as it builds these labs facebook is adding to pressure on universities and nonprofit research operations which are already struggling to retain professors and other employees
the expansion is blow for carnegie mellon in particular in uber hired researchers and technical engineers from the university xe robotics lab to staff self driving car operation in pittsburgh and the wall street journal reported this week that jpmorgan chase had hired manuela veloso carnegie mellon xe head of so called machine learning technology to oversee its artificial intelligence operation
xe cit is worrisome that they are eating the seed corn xe said dan weld computer science professor at the university of washington xe cif we lose all our faculty it will be hard to keep preparing the next generation of researchers xe
with the new labs facebook xe which already operates labs in silicon valley new york paris and montreal xe is establishing two new fronts in global competition for talent
over the last five years artificial intelligence has been added to number of tech products from digital assistants and online translation services to self driving vehicles and the world xe largest internet companies from google to microsoft to baidu are jockeying for researchers who specialize in these technologies many of them are coming from academia
xe cwe xe re basically going where the talent is xe mr schroepfer said
but the supply of talent is not keeping up with demand and salaries have skyrocketed well known researchers are receiving compensation in salary bonuses and stock worth millions of dollars many in the field worry that the talent drain from academia could have lasting impact in the united states and other countries simply because schools won xe have the teachers they need to educate the next generation of experts
over the last few months facebook approached number of notable researchers in seattle it hired luke zettlemoyer professor at the university of washington who specializes in technology that aims to understand and use natural human language the company confirmed this is an important area of research for facebook as it struggles to identify and remove false and malicious content on its networks
in the fall mr zettlemoyer told the new york times that he had turned down an offer from google that was three times his teaching salary about according to public records so he could keep his post at the university instead he took part time position at the allen institute for artificial intelligence seattle lab backed by the microsoft co founder paul allen
many researchers retain their professorships when moving to the big companies xe that xe mr zettlemoyer xe plan while he works for facebook xe but they usually cut back on their academic work at facebook academics typically spend percent of their time at the company and percent at their university
like the other internet giants facebook acknowledges the importance of the university system but at the same time the companies are eager to land top researchers
in pittsburgh facebook hired two professors from the carnegie mellon robotics institute abhinav gupta and jessica hodgins who specialized in computer vision technology
the new facebook lab will focus on robotics and xe creinforcement learning xe way for robots to learn tasks by trial and error siddhartha srinivasa robotics professor at the university of washington said he was also approached by facebook in recent months it was not clear to him why the internet company was interested in robotics
andrew moore dean of computer science at carnegie mellon did not respond to request for comment but over the past several months he has been vocal about the movement of researchers toward the big internet companies google also operates an engineering office near carnegie mellon
xe cwhat we xe re seeing is not necessarily good for society but it is rational behavior by these companies xe he said
the two new facebook labs are part of wider expansion for the company xe operation in december facebook announced that it had hired another computer vision expert jitendra malik professor at the university of california berkeley he now oversees the lab at the company xe headquarters in menlo park calif
even with its deep pockets facebook faces fierce competition for talent mr allen recently gave the allen institute which he created in an additional million in funding after losing mr zettlemoyer to facebook the allen institute hired noah smith and yejin choi two of his colleagues at the university of washington
like mr zettlemoyer both specialize in natural language processing and both say they received offers from multiple internet companies
the nonprofit is paying mr smith and ms choi small fraction of what they were offered to join the commercial sector but the allen institute will allow them to spend half their time at the university and collaborate with wide range of companies said oren etzioni who oversees the allen institute
xe cthe salary numbers are so large that even paul allen can xe match them xe mr etzioni said xe cbut there are still some people who won xe go corporate xe
others researchers believe that companies like facebook still align with their academic goals nonetheless ed lazowska the bill and melinda gates professor of computer science at the university of washington said he was concerned that the large internet companies were luring too many of the university xe professors into the commercial sector
carnegie mellon and the university of washington he said are working on set of recommendations for commercial companies meant to provide way for universities and companies to share talent more equally mr lazowska added that every university should ensure that it did not become too close to one company
xe cthe university must be switzerland xe he said xe cwe want every company to collaborate with us and to feel like they have an equal opportunity to hire our students and work with our faculty xe
an earlier version of this article misstated ed lazowska xe position at the university of washington he is the bill and melinda gates professor of computer science not the chairman of the computer science and engineering department

mountain view calif xe if you want to understand the priorities of technology company first look at the seating chart
at google xe silicon valley headquarters the chief executive sundar pichai now shares floor with google brain research lab dedicated to artificial intelligence
when facebook created its own artificial intelligence lab at its offices about seven miles away it temporarily gave researchers desks next to the fish bowl of conference room where its chief executive and founder mark zuckerberg holds his meetings
xe ci can high five mark and sheryl from my desk and the team was right next to us xe said facebook xe chief technology officer mike schroepfer referring to mr zuckerberg and sheryl sandberg the chief operating officer
even overstock com the online retailer based in the salt lake city area now runs mini research operation called olabs it sits directly outside the office of the company xe chief executive patrick byrne
growing number of tech companies are pushing research labs and other far reaching engineering efforts closer to the boss the point is unmistakable what they are doing matters to the chief executive it may even be the future of the company
xe cthe world is moving faster and faster it is being driven by technology and innovation xe said john kotter an emeritus professor at harvard business school who has written several books on business leadership xe cand lot of these businesses are concluding that the speed of technological innovation should be the heart of everything xe
year ago the google brain team of mathematicians coders and hardware engineers sat in small office building on the other side of the company xe campus but over the past few months it switched buildings and now works right beside the loungelike area where mr pichai and other top executives work
jeffrey dean the celebrated google engineer who oversees the brain lab is short walk from mr pichai so are ian goodfellow the researcher behind new technique that generates lifelike images on its own and norm jouppi who explores ways of accelerating research through new breed of computer chip
xe cany thinks lot about where people are sitting xe who they can walk around and have casual conversations with xe said diane greene who oversees google xe cloud computing team and sits on the board of alphabet google xe parent company xe cit is very significant statement that he has moved that group right next him xe
google is placing big bets on the being explored by researchers like mr goodfellow many questions still hang over the progress of this research but mr pichai and the rest of the google leadership hope it will accelerate the evolution of everything from smartphones and home appliances to internet services and robotics
to mr byrne shaking up the seating chart at overstock was bit like common management tactic in the military when an officer will work closely with small xe ccommand initiatives group xe that is considerably more nimble than the rest of the organization
xe cwe were getting bureaucratic xe mr byrne said xe cand this was way of creating added competition outside the bureaucracy xe
these big companies are trying to duplicate the vibe of silicon valley start up where the boss is next to everyone as start ups grow they often put key technology teams next to the chief executive ms greene who was the chief executive of the software company vmware said she had always made point of sitting beside the top engineers because they saw the company xe future
there are limits to these arrangements when facebook built team to explore the future of virtual reality on its vast social network it made similar desk move the group is no longer seated next to mr zuckerberg facebook said this was because the group had grown too large but across silicon valley virtual reality is no longer the buzziest of topics that honor belongs to artificial intelligence
where you sit has mattered for years at facebook the company xe ad group traditionally sat far away from mr zuckerberg but after facebook went public and started big push for revenue important members of the ad team moved next to the boss said antonio garc xc xada mart xc xadnez who wrote book about his experiences inside facebook
at overstock mr byrne walks past his small research team every time he leaves his office like ms greene he sees this as an opportunity for spontaneous interaction the team members can discuss their work with him and mr byrne doctor of philosophy with long history of unorthodox business choices will share his far reaching ideas with them and he gets to hear without the pressure of formal presentation what the engineers are excited about
xe cit was undeniable that proximity sparked conversation xe said judd bagley kind of roving technologist and strategist who once worked in this group xe cpatrick prides himself on being able to walk up to anyone at the company say xe hello xe and occasionally even eat french fries off the plate on their desk xe
through olabs overstock became the first major retailer to accept payment in the bitcoin digital currency and the lab eventually produced company spinoff that seeks to apply the bitcoin ethos to financial trading now in an echo of the labs at google and facebook the operation is focused on machine learning which involves systems that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing large amounts of data
if chief executive is close to these researchers he or she is learning from them but the boss is also showing them how important they are to the company that is enormously valuable for engineers and mathematicians who are not necessarily generating immediate revenue said kevin quennesson start up executive who ran an team at twitter
he also warned that companies risked putting too much pressure on researchers to produce results from work that was by definition trip into the unknown amid so much spontaneous conversation with the chief executive mr bagley said it is sometimes difficult to tell the difference between xe cthe formal direction and informal brainstorming xe
status at facebook was defined by how close your desk was to mr zuckerberg mr mart xc xadnez said and if you were close to the boss other groups resented you
priorities also tend to ebb and flow at overstock new bitcoin project will squeeze in beside olabs and at facebook the lab is no longer side by side with mr zuckerberg because it also grew too large
still this work is particularly important to the company as it works to ensure xe cthe safety and integrity of our community xe xe which has become facebook code for guarding against false misleading or dangerous activity on its social network mr schroepfer said and the team is still only short walk from mr zuckerberg

one day this fall ashutosh garg the chief executive of recruiting service called eightfold ai turned up xc xa sum xc xa that piqued his interest
it belonged to prospective data scientist someone who unearths patterns in data to help businesses make decisions like how to target ads but curiously the xc xa sum xc xa featured the term xe cdata science xe nowhere
instead the xc xa sum xc xa belonged to an analyst at barclays who had done graduate work in physics at the university of california los angeles though his profile on the social network linkedin indicated that he had never worked as data scientist eightfold xe software flagged him as good fit he was similar in certain key ways like his math and computer chops to four actual data scientists whom mr garg had instructed the software to consider as model
the idea is not to focus on job titles but xe cwhat skills they have xe mr garg said xe cyou xe re really looking for people who have not done it but can do it xe
the power of such technology will be immediately apparent to any employer scrambling to fill jobs in tight labor market xe not least positions for data scientists whom companies like google facebook and amazon are competing to attract
thanks to services like eightfold which rely on sophisticated algorithms to match workers and jobs many employers may soon have access to universe of prospective workers xe even for hard to fill roles xe whom they might not otherwise have come across
and while that could also help some candidates there xe potential downside for job seekers such algorithms may also lower wages in these fields said bo cowgill an economist at columbia university who has studied the use of artificial intelligence in hiring
xe cyou get the more nontraditional equally qualified equally high performing people xe mr cowgill said but the employer xe cdoesn xe seem to have to compete for them as much xe
for years employers and online intermediaries have used algorithms to help fill job openings but their methods were often crude computer would identify key words on xc xa sum xc xa then determine whether those words corresponded to text in job descriptions
while this approach can be more efficient than manually searching site like linkedin it has drawbacks applicants can game the process by larding their xc xa sum xc xa with terms the machines are likely to be looking for conversely poorly worded job listings could cause computers to overlook qualified candidates
but recent advances in form of artificial intelligence known as deep learning have made the machines used by some companies like eightfold and the online job hub ziprecruiter far more powerful instead of simply scanning words on page and matching them to words in job description machine can now identify skills and aptitudes that don xe explicitly appear on candidate xe xc xa sum xc xa
to illustrate mr garg points out that about percent of software engineers at the financial software company intuit in mountain view calif know the programming language java according to data eightfold has analyzed that means the machine is on safe ground inferring that an intuit software engineer knows java even if he or she doesn xe list the skill on xc xa sum xc xa
by performing similar exercise across an entire xc xa sum xc xa the company xe software can build detailed profile of job applicant it can extract more than the usual amount of information from categories like education certain disciplines at less prominent universities like natural language processing at the university of massachusetts amherst produce high achieving workers and even hobbies chess players tend to be good at coding basketball players at sales
eightfold which is based in silicon valley also makes clever trade with clients to improve its results eightfold asks clients to use its human resources software which imports employee data in anonymous form this includes information on how workers with different backgrounds perform in different jobs and how much they earn
eightfold can then use this data to better predict performance xe say how well an intuit software engineer who plays chess and graduated from the university of massachusetts might do at amazon or microsoft
intuit did not respond to request for comment
the software tool can be especially powerful to an employer intent on expanding search beyond candidates with conventional experience and qualifications in that case recruiter can specify criteria like industry and location and even how likely the candidate is to accept an offer that would turn up less traditional xc xa sum xc xa
claudia villanueva recruiting and diversity official at adroll group which helps clients with digital ads and marketing said she recently used eightfold when trying to fill financial planning position the top candidate had experience in industries the tech world often shuns like manufacturing but the eightfold algorithm flagged her as winner
xe cthe tech industry sometimes has hard time moving past tech experience xe ms villanueva said xe cwe keep hiring the same people in the industry to me this is really interesting example of how we broke that cycle bit xe
in the case of the barclays analyst eightfold xe software pegged him as budding data scientist partly because he had master xe degree in statistics and knew computer programming languages like and matlab even though he had no apparent background in data science
xe cwe have gone ahead and analyzed tens of millions to hundreds of millions of profiles of people to see how people have moved in their career xe mr garg said xe cyou can predict what they xe re likely to do next very easily xe he conceded that the approach worked less well in new or obscure fields with limited data
steve goodman the chief executive of restless bandit another firm that applies artificial intelligence to recruiting compared the exercise of finding nontraditional candidates to filling professional sports roster
sports franchises tend to pay far more for free agents who leave their previous team than for players they draft out of college or high school because the free agents have record but if computers were able to predict the performance of draft picks with relative precision this could change their calculus the price of free agents might drop and the price of signing draft pick would rise this is in effect what software can accomplish using artificial intelligence
xe cwe surface people we think would be good draft picks xe rather than people doing the same jobs mr goodman said xe cthis person is little more junior but based on their career track people who look like them are cheaper and better for you xe
mr cowgill the columbia economist said this logic was largely correct but with one key wrinkle according to his research the gains to the less obviously qualified candidates unearthed by machines can be so large that they offset smaller losses to conventional candidates
in technical field like software engineering for example dropout from no name university could end up making very comfortable living after becoming known to employers but established coders are sufficiently in demand that wages are likely to remain high even as it becomes easier to find alternatives
in fields requiring fewer technical skills on the other hand wages could fall significantly
consider say senior marketing jobs for which large companies often require master xe degree in business administration if machines can reliably identify less experienced less credentialed candidates who are likely to excel it could depress wages
xe cyou can think of cases in the product market where people thought they needed something special and you really didn xe xe the commodity low cost person took over xe said john horton labor economist at think of hand held video cameras after the proliferation of smartphones
xe cthat could happen in labor markets with the realization that you don xe need anything special here xe mr horton said
all of this presumes however that deep learning technology is viable for use in recruiting and human resources and could eventually become commonplace surveys suggest that only small minority of companies have adopted these tools and that even fewer feel prepared to exploit them
recent paper summarizing the findings of conference at the university of pennsylvania involving roughly employers cited variety of problems among them were the difficulty of measuring employees xe performance and the sense of unfairness that workers might feel if computer were to make hiring firing and promotion decisions
perhaps the greatest concern is basic methodological point xe call it the problem if you were studying national basketball association players to figure out what makes one great you would find almost no correlation between performance and height almost everyone in this rarefied world is taller than average and those who aren xe compensate with other gifts like unusual speed and athleticism
if on the other hand you selected people at random from the general population and gauged their basketball potential you would find that it was highly correlated with height
the concern is that machines are in effect only studying players xe the people who already have jobs at company or even the people who sought jobs xe not the general population
mr cowgill believes there are solutions he wrote paper showing that seemingly unqualified applicants whom company accidentally interviews allow machine to simulate crude randomized experiment helping the company learn more about what makes good employee
but perhaps more telling is that sophisticated technology companies are already using artificial intelligence to help fill jobs mr garg who worked as research scientist at google for four years says the company uses such techniques in its recruiting
google says it uses machines to take second look at xc xa sum xc xa in its database that human recruiters may have missed for limited set of roles
the advantage that vendor like eightfold has mr garg asserted is access to internal data at dozens of other companies something even google can xe claim xe cwe now can build much deeper models than these companies can build by themselves xe he said

ford motor ousted one of its most senior officials on wednesday over what it called xe cinappropriate behavior xe adding to the turmoil at company already struggling to lift its profits and plot new strategic course
the official raj nair had been an executive vice president and the head of ford xe north american operations since june he had previously served as ford xe chief technology officer during his three decade career with the automaker
xe cwe made this decision after thorough review and careful consideration xe ford xe chief executive jim hackett said in statement released by the company xe cford is deeply committed to providing and nurturing safe and respectful culture and we expect our leaders to fully uphold these values xe
in recent months there has been wave of dismissals and resignations of powerful corporate officials after revelations about workplace misconduct including sexual harassment mr nair xe departure from ford is one of the most prominent ousters outside the media and entertainment industries
concerns over the workplace culture at ford have become persistent problem for the company details of sexual and racial harassment of female workers at two of the automaker xe plants were uncovered in new york times investigation published in december
ford declined to elaborate on the nature of mr nair xe actions but said that an internal investigation had determined that they had been inconsistent with the company xe code of conduct
replacing mr nair as head of north american operations will be kumar galhotra ford xe chief marketing officer and head of the lincoln brand the company announced thursday he is year ford veteran stuart rowley the automaker xe vice president for strategy will become chief operating officer of the north american business
ford was dealing with turbulence in its executive ranks even before the departure of mr nair last may the automaker named mr hackett its new chief executive replacing mark fields mr hackett former chief executive of the office furniture maker steelcase had been running ford xe activities related to self driving cars
since then mr hackett has sketched the outlines of new strategy to guide ford although investors have remained uninspired and its stock has slumped in january the company reported decline in profit in and warned that little improvement was likely in
xe cinvestors and analysts have been unhappy with the seeming lack of clear direction for ford especially in terms of future mobility services xe said michelle krebs executive analyst at autotrader com xe cthe pressure is on jim hackett to lay out clear road ahead for ford xe
mr nair had been seen as rising star at the automaker and potential future chief executive
he studied mechanical engineering at kettering university in flint mich and joined ford shortly after graduating in he worked his way up through the engineering ranks with stints in asia where he worked closely with joe hinrichs currently ford xe president of global automotive operations
in mr nair was named chief technology officer and head of vehicle development in that post he oversaw the development of several important models including the aluminum bodied pickup truck that went into production in under his direction ford set plan to develop fully self driving car with no steering wheel and begin mass production of it by
shortly before mr hackett was named chief executive mr nair was one of at least four top officials given special stock based retention bonuses his package was worth million but was not due to vest until
after mr hackett arrived mr nair was put in charge of north america ford xe largest and most profitable region the assignment however was something of demotion moving mr nair from global post to regional job
in statement issued by ford on wednesday mr nair was contrite
xe ci sincerely regret that there have been instances where have not exhibited leadership behaviors consistent with the principles that the company and have always espoused xe mr nair said in the statement xe ci continue to have the utmost faith in the people of ford motor company and wish them continued success in the future xe
his departure came just weeks after ford announced the resignation of the chief of its operations in china jason luo who had been hired away from an auto parts maker only five months earlier company official said mr luo xe departure had been related to xe cpersonal reasons that predate his time at ford xe
just few weeks before that ford had been forced to deal with the fallout of the times investigation of longstanding abuses at two of its plants in chicago in august ford had reached million settlement with the equal employment opportunity commission in case related to the plants
shortly after the times published its report ford apologized to the workers there in an open letter from mr hackett
in the letter mr hackett declared xe ci promise that we will learn from this and we will do better xe

if you xe re among the multitudes skeptical that computers might one day be trustworthy replacements for drivers consider this the national highway traffic safety administration says that percent of serious crashes are the result of human error
so yes computers may prove to be safer at the controls it xe not high bar
the secret sauce of those computers xe becoming our chauffeurs is the ubiquitous force of artificial intelligence which is already active in virtual personal assistants and bank xe customer service chat bot but it xe the automobile where could have critical role for the greatest number of people few applications carry the responsibility of automotive safety systems where actions must be carried out in nanoseconds and an ill considered response may have costly consequences
systems that marry microprocessors sensors and software to make fully driverless cars possible are in the advanced stages of development but experts say the leap from today xe computer assisted driving xe features like tesla xe enhanced autopilot and cadillac xe super cruise xe to fully automated motoring that may render humans optional remains considerable
still is already quietly making driving safer beyond the applications now found in new cars typically in conveniences like the speech recognition feature of infotainment systems are the subsystems that make up the packages of safety features common largely in luxury vehicles enhancements like night vision automatic emergency braking and lane keeping all depend on processors that use sensors and computer instructions to warn drivers of danger or act to avoid collisions
the term artificial intelligence coined in the is something of an unfortunate choice at least in terms of the automobile the intelligence within cars xe that is their ability to learn and to apply that knowledge xe is far from artificial it is hard earned it comes down to capable electronics sensors and especially extensive training
xe ctraining is like teaching our kids to drive with rules absolutes and best practices xe glen de vos chief technology officer at aptiv said in telephone interview xe csome rules are embedded in the system xe never out drive the free space around the vehicle obey road signs xe but as you move up the spectrum toward accident avoidance predictive capacity is necessary xe
aptiv successor to delphi automotive an auto industry supplier builds the data sets that trained system depends on most of that data is accumulated on the road acquired in videos to create the basic knowledge bank that computers draw on in some cases this work is done overseas to reduce costs and suppliers can make use of basic image collections xe known as trained data set xe obtained off the shelf from market research organizations
the key to making the images useful is adding detailed annotation xe instructions that specify xe cthis is tree this is garbage can xe xe for the object recognition function that is vital to preventing collisions the work is tedious and until recently has been mainly manual task with up to percent of the work devoted to classifying images and cleansing data said sachin lulla ibm xe automotive leader
data is also collected by radar or lidar its light beam equivalent
high degree of refinement of the data covering every possible situation is vital to assuring that the safety systems don xe issue excessive warnings an annoyance that may lead driver to ignore such signals
the collecting of data to inform automotive systems will be greatly improved by coming generation of connected cars xe million communicating wirelessly with each other by xe according to mr lulla the megabytes of data per second generated by these cars covering such things as local weather and road conditions will be huge benefit to the entire community of connected vehicles
some of the tasks where takes an important role happen inside the car driver monitoring is major component of advanced safety systems with cameras mounted in the dashboard watching eye and head positions and even pulse rate through steering wheel sensor the concept ibm says is to add context xe the driver xe condition and degree of engagement xe to complete the picture of the situation in the car and on the road
xe cunderstanding the driver through facial expressions of emotions is important xe said ola bostrom vice president for research and patents at veoneer spinoff from autoliv an auto safety supplier xe ccognitive load can also be assessed using eye motions attention to driving can be evaluated by whether people in the car are talking to one another or thinking about what to say xe
the information along with factors like pitch of voice and use of aggressive words has multiple uses evaluations of alertness and fatigue based on analysis are already built into several car models with dashboard warnings for countering stress and anger when fully autonomous driving for privately owned vehicles becomes available the potential for car to sense driver xe illness and head for hospital becomes reality
one of xe strengths is simple object recognition
xe cif you can solve problem using traditional method it xe incredibly efficient xe said mr de vos of aptiv referring to existing safety systems xe cin the case of vision system identifying person standing next to the road you can write relatively simple rule to determine what should be done xe
but when problem becomes more complex like when an obstacle is detected in the road during snowstorm the advantage of using is its ability to solve problems that are otherwise too complex for existing systems simply gets answers lot faster
among the challenges in developing is its lack of transparency said kurt lehmann head of technology development at continental one of the largest suppliers to the auto industry
xe ca fundamental weakness of the systems is that it xe black box xe mr lehmann said referring to the challenge of analyzing the actions of algorithms xe cit xe not always predictable and you can xe always tell why decision has been made so robust training and validation are needed xe
the demands of advanced driver assistance systems do not necessarily have to be frozen at the time the car is built not only can software be updated but self learning algorithms can continuously raise the car xe by building relational connections said salah hadi veoneer xe global director of vision systems
xe cideally we want to have the system recognize an image it xe never seen like person figuring out what an orangutan is because he knows what an ape looks like xe mr hadi said xe cthis is the tuning part of developing and takes lot of time xe
the computing power it takes to operate car with self driving capability is staggering graphics processing unit to perform object recognition works at computer speed of trillion floating point operations per second the main processor xe performance is measures in millions of instructions per second
stepping up from the partial automation of the mercedes benz driver assistance system to fully automated driving which may require car to have up to dozen cameras demands hundredfold increase in computer power and veoneer says the requirement is increasing by factor of three to five every other year
this does not come cheap for the conditional automation known as level aptiv estimates that the hardware xe sensors computer and communications gear xe will cost to per car that figure does not include software
while automakers have embraced the goal of eliminating all fatalities deploying and autonomous vehicles can go only so far toward achieving that drunken driver of an older car could still blow through stop sign and road conditions will still be responsible for some collisions
so where are we on scale of true intelligence in cars
xe ci honestly believe we are still scratching the surface of applying the technologies of deep learning and neural networks xe said mr lulla of ibm xe cas computing increases we will see this scale to true potential the big issue is to perfect autonomous driving with human driving autonomous vehicles driving with other seems far along but when there is someone on bike it gets tricky xe

ford motor and volkswagen have outlined what the companies hope will become broad alliance xe one that will hasten development of electric and self driving cars and eventually cut costs
but the initial step announced tuesday plan to cooperate on pickup trucks and delivery vans will do little to address the troubles both automakers face now it also falls short of the detailed restructuring plan from ford that investors have been waiting to see for more than year
on the fringes of the north american international auto show in detroit ford said it would develop and manufacture compact pickup truck that the two companies may sell under their own names in south america africa and europe the truck will be based on the new ford ranger which goes on sale in the next few weeks ford will also produce large delivery van and volkswagen compact van both primarily for europe
ford expects those projects to save about million year but not until after the vehicles are introduced in
xe cwe are forecasting the benefits at the end of our five year period so it is the time frame mostly that the synergies start to accrue xe ford xe chief executive jim hackett said in conference call
the companies said they were continuing to discuss ways to cooperate in the development of electric vehicles and self driving technology but stopped short of detailing how they might do that
xe cit just makes sense to share investment pool innovation capabilities and create scale effects in clearly defined areas xe said volkswagen xe chief executive herbert diess xe cand that xe what we are going to do together with ford xe
rebecca lindland an independent auto consultant said that many big auto alliances failed but that those that prospered tended to start out small and expand slowly
xe cvw and ford have nice synergy with their customer base so this limited partnership could be successful xe she said
ford has invested more than billion in bid to produce driverless vehicle that can transport passengers or deliver goods it is also spending billion to develop more than three dozen electric or hybrid models that it plans to roll out over the next five years
volkswagen too is developing string of electric cars on monday the company said it would spend million to build plant next to its existing factory in chattanooga tenn it will assemble battery powered sport utility vehicle that the company has called the id crozz
volkswagen xe push into electric vehicles began after its diesel scandal in which it rigged diesel cars with software to cheat on emissions tests to settle lawsuits in the united states it agreed to buy back diesel cars from owners and paid fine of billion it also promised to introduce range of electric vehicles in the united states and has funded company that is installing charging stations in cities around the country
but both companies have more immediate issues suddenly slumping auto market in china slow growth and slim margins in europe and the need to develop technologies to meet the stringent emissions regulations that europe will phase in
ford xe issues go beyond those challenges unlike general motors whose stock jumped last week when it raised its financial guidance ford is expected to show decline from year earlier when it releases its fourth quarter earnings next week while the company remains solidly profitable in north america it is losing or barely making money in the rest of the world
mr hackett who was named chief executive almost two years ago to revitalize ford has announced plans to cut jobs but has not yet outlined comprehensive turnaround strategy xe something many analysts expected within months of his taking the top job
xe cford continues to frustrate investors by delivering piecemeal information on its future plans xe said philippe houchois an analyst at jefferies securities xe cwe continue to see tremendous scope for improving ford xe performance through its own restructuring and more extensive cooperation with vw xe
ford xe stock has been trading at levels last seen during the recession decade ago on tuesday its shares fell percent to

an accusation that twitter was suppressing conservative political views drew the attention of president trump here xe what xe really going on
by liam stack
when president trump accused twitter of xe cshadow banning xe republicans in tweet on thursday morning it was the latest salvo in long running debate over whether social media platforms suppress conservative users because of their political views
twitter xe cshadow banning xe prominent republicans not good we will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once many complaints
the president xe tweet came day after widely circulated article published by vice news said that twitter was shadow banning xe cprominent republicans xe but many in the tech world said the vice story xe which was shared by prominent conservatives on twitter including the house majority leader kevin mccarthy james xe keefe and donald trump jr xe was based on misunderstanding of the concept of shadow banning that could make an already tense debate more acrimonious
so what is going on here what is shadow banning was twitter actually doing it why is the president involved we xe ve got you covered
when person is shadow banned their posts on platform are rendered essentially invisible to everyone but themselves their experience using site may not change xe they feel like they are still posting normally xe but other people cannot see the material they produce said monica stephens professor at the state university of new york at buffalo who studies social media
xe cshadow banning is when you are algorithmically being kind of shut down and that often has to do with particularly the content that you are posting xe ms stephens said xe cmaybe it doesn xe violate the terms of service but they make it so other people can xe see that content xe
the benefit of this from the perspective of an online community is that if user does not realize they have been shadow banned then they are less likely to just open new account and use that one to continue their unwanted behavior
no it is not vice claimed that twitter was shadow banning some republicans because their accounts xe cno longer appear in the auto populated drop down search box xe
the profiles appear when conducting full search the article noted but not in the xe cmore convenient and visible drop down bar xe
basically you could still search for the accounts but twitter would not automatically suggest them but that is not what shadow banning means xe or meant before this week xe and on wednesday and thursday the internet engaged in real time debate over its definition
in statement twitter flatly rejected the claim made by vice xe cas we have said before we do not xe shadowban xe xe
kevin collier tech writer at buzzfeed news marveled at the misuse of the phrase by both vice news and the president spokesman for vice did not respond to an email seeking comment on thursday
the republicans mentioned by vice news included ronna mcdaniel the chairwoman of the republican party representatives mark meadows jim jordan and matt gaetz and andrew surabian spokesman for donald trump jr who does not hold position within the party
after the story was published many republicans said they felt vindicated by its claims
but all of these people xe twitter accounts and new tweets they write are still visible to the public when you type their names into the search box and hit xe creturn xe twitter includes them in the results when you type their names into google their twitter accounts and their three most recent tweets are often the top search result
in short their twitter accounts remain highly visible
xe cthat is not at all shadow banning xe ms stephens said xe cthis all goes back to lot of people not understanding how the social media they interact with works xe
that is the evergreen question of life on the internet
it is true that the names of some republican officials are not auto generating in twitter xe drop down search bar twitter has said it is aware of this situation and it trying to fix it
xe cthe profiles tweets and discussions about these accounts do appear when you search for them xe the company said in statement on wednesday xe cto be clear our behavioral ranking doesn xe make judgments based on political views or the substance of tweets xe
what does that mean well as even the most casual twitter user may be aware the site has problem with people on it saying and doing terrible things from russian election hackers to the former ku klux klan leader david duke
tech companies like facebook and twitter have wrestled mightily in recent years with how to combat the impact trolls have on the experience of other users and what to do when their behavior either begins in the real world in the case of russian hackers or spills over into it for example by causing mob violence in india
in may the company said in blog post that it would start using xe cpolicies human review processes and machine learning xe to monitor accounts the results of that review would xe cnow be considered in how we organize and present content in communal areas like conversation and search xe it said
but on wednesday twitter head of product kayvon beykpour xe defended the company xe efforts
and on thursday morning vice news updated its original story and headline with statement saying xe ctwitter appears to have adjusted its platform overnight to no longer limit the visibility of some prominent republicans in its search results xe

san francisco xe whether it is video claiming the earth is flat or the moon landing was faked conspiracy theories are not hard to find on google xe youtube but in significant policy change youtube said on friday that it planned to stop recommending them
after years of criticism that youtube leads viewers to videos that spread misinformation the company said it was changing what videos it recommended to users in blog post youtube said it would no longer suggest videos with xe cborderline content xe or those that xe cmisinform users in harmful way xe even if the footage did not violate its community guidelines
youtube said the number of videos affected by the policy change amounted to fewer than percent of all videos on the platform but given the billions of videos in youtube xe library it is still large number
youtube and other powerful technology platforms have faced rising criticism for failing to police the content that users post
youtube xe recommendation engine has been denounced for pushing users to troubling content even when they showed little interest in such videos it has also been blamed for widening the political divide in the country pushing already partisan viewers to more extreme points of view
the new policy is also the latest example of youtube xe taking more aggressive approach to content that many find distasteful even if it is not in violation of the service xe community guidelines
in late youtube started putting xe ccontroversial religious or supremacist xe content in xe climited state xe so the videos are not monetized with advertising and features such as comments and likes are turned off some videos appear behind brief message saying the videos may be inappropriate or offensive
youtube provided only three examples of the types of videos that it would stop recommending those promoting phony miracle cure for serious illness ones claiming the earth is flat or content making blatantly false claims about historic events like the sept attacks
the company declined to provide more detail on what other videos would be classified borderline
youtube is not taking down the targeted videos and it will still recommend them to users who subscribe to channel that creates such content also youtube will not exclude the so called borderline videos from search results
xe cwe think this change strikes balance between maintaining platform for free speech and living up to our responsibility to users xe youtube wrote in the blog post
youtube said it was constantly adjusting its recommendation system noting that it made hundreds of changes last year in its early years youtube said it suggested videos the company thought would lead to more clicks or views but it found that people who created videos had started trying to game the system with clickbait titles
youtube recently said it wanted to recommend videos that viewers would consider xe ctime well spent xe youtube also said it had been working to broaden recommendations so that they weren xe too similar to the most recent video
much like the powerful and opaque algorithms that govern the search results of youtube xe parent company google the video service is secretive about the factors weighed by its systems that dictate which videos are recommended
youtube did not reveal much about how it would determine which videos would be excluded from its recommendations the decisions on specific videos will be made not by youtube employees but by so called machine learning algorithms
human raters from xe call over the xe the company said will watch different youtube videos and provide feedback on the quality of those videos those judgments will help inform what the algorithm flags
google has adopted similar approach in determining the quality of its search results
youtube said it would start making gradual change on small set of videos in the united states but it plans to introduce the alterations globally as the system becomes more accurate

politicians have lots of ideas for regulating big tech here xe how to know which ones work
by kartik hosanagar
mr hosanagar is professor at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania
this election season americans are going to hear lot about regulating big tech senator elizabeth warren has already kicked off that debate and it would be the tone deaf candidate who wasn xe alert to the increasing anxiety among the public over the power silicon valley giants wield according to survey by pew research center percent of democrats and percent of republicans feel that big tech companies should be regulated more than they are now
candidate who fails to address these issues in meaningful way is not taking these concerns seriously but how should we as citizens evaluate these proposals
any effort to regulate big tech will have to address two main issues the first is consumer protection when the private sector controls so much of our data americans should be able to know who has access to this data and how they use it the second issue relates to xe cplatform companies xe services that connect two or more sides of transaction google search connects people with websites amazon connects buyers with sellers apple xe ios and google xe android connect consumers with apps and so on the concern is that platforms can build services that compete with third party services running on their platforms and can easily give themselves an unfair advantage
the more visible concern is consumer protection particularly protections for privacy any regulation addressing consumer protection should first specify whether consumers have the right to access data that companies store about them and whether firms are allowed to share confidential data with third party
just as important the policy should say whether companies are allowed to make socially consequential decisions such as mortgage approval or job recruiting based on that sensitive information if so are those companies required to tell consumers what decisions might be based on such data
these efforts get even more complicated and less transparent when algorithms are involved some of the best performing algorithms such as neural networks are not easily interpretable even to their programmers at the same time modern machine learning algorithms are susceptible to the same gender race and age biases that affect human decisions
while these concerns are particularly notable with big tech they are just as relevant for retail health care or financial services firms any proposed consumer protection regulation should include formal audits by companies to verify that their algorithms are fair preserve privacy and are reliable at least in settings where algorithmic decisions have social consequences such as hiring news curation and school admissions
proposals to regulate big tech also have to deal with how platform companies treat the firms that offer products content or services on their platforms anticompetitive practices can stifle innovation and also limit consumers xe ability to easily switch to alternative products or services on the platform anticompetitive practices include among other things giving preferred placement to platform xe own products and blocking third party services from access to certain platform features
for example yelp has repeatedly accused google of deprioritizing its pages on google search results similarly spotify has complained that apple forces app developers to use its payment platform for processing in app purchases this ability to charge spotify commission gives apple music pricing advantage over its rival
senator warren suggests that platforms should not be allowed to offer services under her plan amazon marketplace for example would not be permitted to sell amazonbasics products which competes with marketplace sellers
in theory banning platforms from offering their own products and services would offer protection against anti competitive behavior but in practice it is difficult for new platform with few users to lure third party service and product providers so platforms often have to build some core services when they launch
the original iphone for example lacked an app store and mostly featured apps developed by apple including apps for note taking weather and messaging this attracts an early base of users who demonstrate that people want that service in turn drawing other companies that might be able to provide better version of that same service
companies also sometimes launch services and then wake up to their platform potential later amazon for example set up its marketplace many years after its launch as bookseller moreover deep integration between platforms and services is sometimes useful to consumers payment is built into apple xe ios platform in part to increase security and convenience might these benefits be worth the competitive disadvantage to third party payment services such as paypal
this brings us to the regulatory question where should regulators draw the line that separates platforms from the services built on the platform clever proposal will be one that manages to create logical way to separate services that are essential for platform to exist and which the platform is therefore allowed to operate from those that platforms either must not operate or if they do must be treated in the same way as third party services
yes some of this gets technical but we need an informed citizenry on tech regulation just as we do for the political debates over health care jobs or foreign policy overzealous actions by elected officials will affect the tech industry the growth engine of the american economy it xe time for citizens to engage with these questions because they will shape not only the economy but also how we use the digital services that are so firmly entrenched in our lives

facebook said on wednesday that it would ban white nationalist content from its platforms significant policy change that bows to longstanding demands from civil rights groups who said the tech giant was failing to confront the powerful reach of white extremism on social media
the threat posed by white nationalism on facebook was violently underlined this month when racist gunman killed people at two mosques in new zealand using the platform to post live video of the attack facebook removed the video and the gunman xe account on facebook and instagram but the footage was widely shared on youtube twitter and reddit
the company had previously banned white supremacist content from its platforms but maintained murky distinction between white supremacy white nationalism and white separatism on wednesday it said that its views had been changed by civil society groups and experts in race relations and that it now believed xe cwhite nationalism and separatism cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups xe
kristen clarke the president of the lawyers xe committee for civil rights under law which helped facebook shape its new attitude toward white nationalism said the earlier policy xe cleft gaping hole in terms of what it provided for white supremacists to fully pursue their platform xe
xe conline hate must be confronted if we are going to make meaningful progress in the fight against hate so this is really significant victory xe ms clarke said
the charlottesville attacker pleaded guilty to federal hate crime charges
as part of its policy change facebook said it would divert users who searched for white supremacist content to life after hate nonprofit that helps people leave hate groups and would improve its ability to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to combat white nationalism
xe cit xe clear that these concepts are deeply linked to organized hate groups and have no place on our services xe facebook said in statement posted online on wednesday it later added xe cgoing forward while people will still be able to demonstrate pride in their ethnic heritage we will not tolerate praise or support for white nationalism and separatism xe
the company said its decision which takes effect next week was based on rethinking of its earlier policy on white nationalism which it saw as concept akin to ethnic pride and something different from and less dangerous than white supremacy
xe cour policies have long prohibited hateful treatment of people based on characteristics such as race ethnicity or religion xe and that has always included white supremacy xe the company said in statement xe cwe didn xe originally apply the same rationale to expressions of white nationalism and separatism because we were thinking about broader concepts of nationalism and separatism xe things like american pride and basque separatism which are an important part of people xe identity xe
facebook xe decision was praised by civil rights groups and experts in extremism many of whom had strongly disapproved of the company xe previous understanding of white nationalism
madihha ahussain lawyer for muslim advocates civil rights group said the policy change was xe ca welcome development xe in the wake of the new zealand mosque shootings but she said the company still had to explain how it will enforce the policy including how it will determine what constitutes white nationalist content
xe cwe need to know how facebook will define white nationalist and white separatist content xe she said in an email xe cfor example will it include expressions of anti muslim anti black anti jewish anti immigrant and anti lgbtq sentiment xe all underlying foundations of white nationalism further if the policy lacks robust informed and assertive enforcement it will continue to leave vulnerable communities at the mercy of hate groups xe
mark pitcavage who tracks domestic extremism for the anti defamation league said the shift from facebook was xe ca good thing if they were using such narrow definition before xe
mr pitcavage said the term white nationalism xe chad always been used as euphemism for white supremacy and today it is still used as euphemism for white supremacy xe he called the two terms xe cidentically extreme xe
he said white supremacists began using the term xe cwhite nationalist xe after the civil rights movement of the when the term xe cwhite supremacy xe began to receive sustained scorn from mainstream society including among white people
xe cthe less hard core white supremacists stopped using any term for themselves but the more hard core white supremacists started using xe white nationalism xe as euphemism for xe white supremacy xe xe he said
and he said comparisons between white nationalism and american patriotism or ethnic pride were misplaced
xe cwhiteness is not an ethnicity it is skin color xe mr pitcavage said xe cand america is multicultural society white nationalism is simply form of white supremacy it is an ideology centered on hate xe

you don xe have to search far to see the impact of the american railroad look inside your refrigerator at the fresh produce or at the car in your driveway xe or the lumber that built your home and the energy that powers everything in it there xe good chance many of these products made their way to your home on the mile network of rails
each year an integrated system of trains trucks and barges ships tons of goods for each american according to the association of american railroads supporting more than million jobs and billion in economic activity
xe cas the economy shifts online rail transportation is playing huge role behind the scenes to get goods to warehouses and to people xe doorsteps xe says tom schnautz assistant vice president for advanced train control technology at norfolk southern railroad that in transported million carloads of freight that reached nearly half of all americans

xe cas the economy shifts online rail transportation is playing huge role behind the scenes to get goods to warehouses and to people xe doorsteps xe says tom schnautz assistant vice president for advanced train control technology at norfolk southern railroad that in transported million carloads of freight that reached nearly half of all americans
growing economy will also further expand the number of critical goods transported on the american rail network by the will see percent increase in national freight shipments the transportation department predicts
to support this growth norfolk southern is using automation machine learning and predictive analytics to optimize its network xe including miles of track nearly freight cars and approximately employees xe so that people and machines can help shape the future of america xe rail system
xe cautomation and big data analytics have allowed our rail employees to shift from being trouble finders to trouble fixers xe schnautz says xe cyou end up with smoother operation more predictability and better service for american businesses and consumers xe

xe single lane highway with multiple streams of traffic xe
to understand the need for new technologies it helps to start with the modern railroad the infrastructure is like complex network of single lane highways with multiple streams of traffic running in different directions from long and short haul freight trains to commuter railroads to interstate passenger trains says warren stubbs director of information system development at norfolk southern for safety purposes only one train is allowed in defined area of track at given time which means trains frequently have to pull over until given xe ctrack authority xe to move ahead
the system works smoothly enough until contingencies arise which often happens in network with tens of thousands of moving parts and one small issue can cause ripple effect cooling water leak on locomotive near knoxville tenn for example can cause breakdown and force delays railyard backups and train shortages from new orleans to columbus ohio
to achieve true visibility norfolk southern built system of systems lattice of artificially intelligent technologies that continuously collect data and use it to automate traditional processes and improve reliability
schnautz isn xe exaggerating when he likens managing norfolk southern xe sprawling network and its infinite variables to playing giant game of chess to achieve true visibility norfolk southern built system of systems lattice of artificially intelligent technologies that continuously collect data and use it to automate traditional processes and improve reliability

here xe how it all works imagine norfolk southern train that xe scheduled to travel to atlanta from chicago throughout its journey engineers and operators need to track the train so it can maintain safe spacing and speeds positive train control new technology continuously leverages sensors gps and on board computing to analyze thousands of variables using this data positive train control can automatically stop the train before it exceeds safe speed limits or enters unauthorized areas of track
xe cby providing both safety umbrella and new stream of accurate location data xe stubbs says xe cpositive train control has allowed us to do more automation within our rail network xe
but this train is just one of thousands running concurrently on norfolk southern xe network to efficiently move them across the rail system norfolk southern designed another technology called movement planner which combines positive train control location data with thousands of other pieces of information to create dynamic master plan using complex logic algorithms movement planner synthesizes all the data every two minutes continuously plotting and updating the most efficient and cost effective routes for each train
xe cmovement planner is the dispatcher xe helper xe says charlie turnipseed former train dispatcher who xe now system manager of dispatch operations at norfolk southern xe cit allows them to use physics xe not subjective human preferences xe to determine the best route for every train across the entire network even as variables change xe
the optimal route for the chicago to atlanta train reaches the conductor through software called auto router which translates movement planner xe master plan into instructions for individual trains streamlining the routing process and helping dispatchers focus on exceptions
as the atlanta bound train continues south it looks for ways to automate its controls and reduce its fuel consumption on board an energy management computer continually calculates the train xe optimal speed by analyzing conditions such as topography track curvature and car weight that information is fed into the train xe auto control system which automatically adjusts its throttle and brake xe much like car xe adaptive cruise control

half moon bay calif xe when news article revealed that clarifai was working with the pentagon and some employees questioned the ethics of building artificial intelligence that analyzed video captured by drones the company said the project would save the lives of civilians and soldiers
xe cclarifai xe mission is to accelerate the progress of humanity with continually improving xe read blog post from matt zeiler the company xe founder and chief executive and prominent researcher later in news media interview mr zeiler announced new management position that would ensure all company projects were ethically sound
as activists researchers and journalists voice concerns over the rise of artificial intelligence warning against biased deceptive and malicious applications the companies building this technology are responding from tech giants like google and microsoft to scrappy start ups many are creating corporate principles meant to ensure their systems are designed and deployed in an ethical way some set up ethics officers or review boards to oversee these principles
but tensions continue to rise as some question whether these promises will ultimately be kept companies can change course idealism can bow to financial pressure some activists xe and even some companies xe are beginning to argue that the only way to ensure ethical practices is through government regulation
xe cwe don xe want to see commercial race to the bottom xe brad smith microsoft xe president and chief legal officer said at the new work summit in half moon bay calif hosted last week by the new york times xe claw is needed xe
the new ethics position at clarifai never materialized as this new york city start up pushed further into military applications and facial recognition services some employees grew increasingly concerned their work would end up feeding automated warfare or mass surveillance in late january on company message board they posted an open letter asking mr zeiler where their work was headed
few days later mr zeiler held companywide meeting according to three people who spoke on the condition that they not be identified for fear of retaliation he explained that internal ethics officers did not suit small company like clarifai and he told the employees that clarifai technology would one day contribute to autonomous weapons
clarifai specializes in technology that instantly recognizes objects in photos and video policymakers call this xe dual use technology xe it has everyday commercial applications like identifying designer handbags on retail website as well as military applications like identifying targets for drones
this and other rapidly advancing forms of artificial intelligence can improve transportation health care and scientific research or they can feed mass surveillance online phishing attacks and the spread of false news
as companies and governments deploy these technologies researchers are also realizing that some systems are woefully biased facial recognition services for instance can be significantly less accurate when trying to identify women or someone with darker skin other systems may include security holes unlike any seen in the past researchers have shown that driverless cars can be fooled into seeing things that are not really there
all this means that building ethical artificial intelligence is an enormously complex task it gets even harder when stakeholders realize that ethics are in the eye of the beholder
as some microsoft employees protest the company xe military contracts mr smith said that american tech companies had long supported the military and that they must continue to do so xe cthe military is charged with protecting the freedoms of this country xe he told the conference xe cwe have to stand by the people who are risking their lives xe
though some clarifai employees draw an ethical line at autonomous weapons others do not mr zeiler argued that autonomous weapons will ultimately save lives because they would be more accurate than weapons controlled by human operators xe ca is an essential tool in helping weapons become more accurate reducing collateral damage minimizing civilian casualties and friendly fire incidents xe he said in statement
google worked on the same pentagon project as clarifai and after protest from company employees the tech giant ultimately ended its involvement but like clarifai as many as other companies have worked on the project without bowing to ethical concerns
after the controversy over its pentagon work google laid down set of xe principles xe meant as guide for future projects but even with the corporate rules in place some employees left the company in protest the new principles are open to interpretation and they are overseen by executives who must also protect the company xe financial interests
xe cyou functionally have situations where the foxes are guarding the henhouse xe said liz fong jones former google employee who left the company late last year
in when google acquired deepmind perhaps the world xe most important lab the company agreed to set up an external review board that would ensure the lab xe research would not be used in military applications or otherwise unethical projects but five years later it is still unclear whether this board even exists
google microsoft facebook and other companies have created organizations like the partnership on that aim to guide the practices of the entire industry but these operations are largely toothless
the most significant changes have been driven by employee protests like the one at google and pointed research from academics and other independent experts after amazon employees protested the sale of facial recognition services to police departments and various academic studies highlighted the bias that plagues these services amazon and microsoft called for government regulation in this area
xe cpeople are recognizing there are issues and they are recognizing they want to change them xe said meredith whittaker google employee and the co founder of the ai now institute research institute that examines the social implications of artificial intelligence but she also told the conference that this change was slow to happen as the forces of capitalism continued to drive these companies toward greater profits
employees at clarifai worry that the same technological tools that drive facial recognition will ultimately lead to autonomous weapons xe and that flaws in these tools will open pandora xe box of problems xe cwe in the industry know that technology can be compromised hackers hack bias is unavoidable xe read the open letter to mr zeiler
thousands of researchers from across the industry have signed separate open letter saying they will oppose autonomous weapons
the pentagon has said that artificial intelligence built by the likes of google and clarifai has not been used for offensive purposes and it is now building its own set of ethical principles realizing it needs the support of industry which has snapped up most of the world xe top researchers in recent years
but many policy experts say they believe these principles are unlikely to hold any more influence than those laid down at the big corporations especially because the pentagon is motivated to keep pace with china russia and other international rivals as they develop similar technology for that reason some are calling for international treaties that would bar the use of autonomous weapons
in their open letter the clarifai employees said they were unsure whether regulation was the answer to the many ethical questions swirling around technology arguing that the immediate responsibility rested with the company itself
xe cregulation slows progress and our species needs progress to survive the many threats that face us today xe they wrote addressing mr zeiler and the rest of the company xe cwe need to be ethical enough to be trusted to make this technology on our own and we owe it to the public to define our ethics clearly xe
but their letter did not have the desired effect in the days after mr zeiler explained that clarifai would most likely contribute to autonomous weapons the employee who wrote the letter and was originally tapped to serve as an ethics adviser liz xe sullivan left the company
researchers and activists like ms whittaker see this as moment when tech employees can use their power to drive change but they have also said this must happen outside tech companies as well as within
xe cwe need regulation xe ms whittaker said before name dropping microsoft xe chief legal officer xe ceven brad smith says we need regulation xe

toronto xe year ago stepped into the samcheong park library in seoul south korea and saw the future the simple building in forested park had nice selection of books cafe at its center and small patio classical music played while patrons read reclining on extra deep window benches that had cushions to sit on and tables that slid over their laps so that they could sip coffee and eat cheesecake while gazing at the leaves changing colors outside seoul is one of the most modern cities in the world place suffused with the latest inescapable technology this library was specifically designed as an antidote to that
xe cwhat xe so innovative about that xe friend who works for the library here in toronto asked when showed her pictures innovation to her meant digital technology from drones and movie streaming services and printers which the library was constantly showing off
xe cwhy couldn xe they both be innovative xe asked
we are told that innovation is the most important force in our economy the one thing we must get right or be left behind but that fear of missing out has led us to foolishly embrace the false trappings of innovation over truly innovative ideas that may be simpler and ultimately more effective this mind set equates innovation exclusively with invention and implies that if you just buy the new thing voil xc xa you have innovated each year businesses institutions and individuals run around like broken toy robots trying to figure out their strategy for the latest buzzword promising salvation
what xe your company xe plan to onboard wearables how xe our google glass program coming where do you stand on big data machine learning how soon can we pivot to video how many tablets should we buy what xe your child xe school xe budget are you all in on instagram snapchat do you even know what cryptocurrency is yeah me neither how much can we afford
at best this is waste of time and money gadgets are procured deployed and discarded resources are squandered as the technology xe actual capabilities fall short of its promise people are forced to work at treadmills then everyone moves on the drones stay grounded the headset languishes in the box iced tea goes back to being iced tea and not some wildly speculative cryptocurrency mining scheme
discover the most compelling features reporting and humor writing from the new york times opinion section selected by our editors sign up for the sunday best newsletter
but at its worst this approach to innovation can truly be destructive schools that hastily purchased tablets for students cut drama music and sports programs to pay for devices with few proven benefits districts that adopted untested computerized voting machines have seen elections compromised companies that integrated artificial intelligence into the hiring process have actually reinforced gender and racial stereotypes publications that increased their focus on video content while slashing reporters all in response to facebook xe viewership numbers later learned that these figures xe the entire basis of their new business models xe had been fudged
silicon valley firms are not immune to this even while deploying the fear of missing innovation as sales tactic they too need to please investors customers and the media which hangs on every news release and so they traffic in their own illusions of innovation they produce cool videos about blimps and solar planes sending wi fi to remote villages in africa always africa they offer cryptic hints about flying cars pizza drones and variety of facebook products no one cares about from video chat device that looks no different from tablet running skype but with added data harvesting to version of the social network xe messenger app built for children the latter is among the most ill considered ill timed ideas of our era
true innovation isn xe just some magic carnival of invention like steve jobs keynote with pretty toy at the end it is continuing process of gradual improvement and assessment that every institution and business experiences in some way often that actually means adopting ideas and tools that already exist but make sense in new context or even returning to methods that worked in the past adapted to the challenges of today these rearview innovations have proved to be as transformative as novel technologies
look no farther than the streets of new york which have been radically redesigned over the past decade to accommodate cyclists and pedestrians with bike lanes and car free zones these ideas aren xe new they were espoused by city planners and activists more than half century ago when robert moses was crisscrossing the city with expressways bulldozing neighborhoods in the name of the car xe transformational technology at the time jane jacobs and other advocates of slower friendlier streets were dismissed as luddites it took more than years of evidence accidents and political courage to realize what colossal mistake the moses approach was and to begin to undo that with proven ideas in people centric urban planning that aim to bring cities back to those who live in them
when you look at those cities you xe ll also find some of the most innovative solutions to the way we conduct commerce not one hour delivery or meal kits on demand but the boom in parallel retail model that is decidedly social and human focused the past decade has seen impressive nationwide growth in farmers markets flea markets and independent bookstores despite all the competition from larger more efficient organizations online and offline even though these places are based on model that harks back to the roots of human commerce they are innovative precisely because they propose valuable community alternative solution to the supermarket or shopping mall that dominates retail this model has been so effective that amazon is opening more bookstores and walmart just announced concept stores that will include food halls farmers markets bike rentals and parks xe the very things the company siphoned away from american towns
perhaps the best examples of rearward innovation are edible the culinary story of the past several decades is dominated not by the scientific improvements we were promised but by return to food and drink xe more delicious past traditional cooking craft beer heirloom vegetables and grass fed beef have brought food forward by turning back we take this as gospel today but during the when pioneering artisan bakers like nancy silverton and jim lahey were trying to get the world to abandon wonder bread for traditional sourdough their ideas were radical and innovative and ultimately changed the way many of us cook shop and eat
this type of reflective innovation requires courage because it calls into question the assumption that newer is necessarily better but increasingly as our worship of silicon valley gives way to growing sense of unease we are asking those questions and innovating appropriately countless schools have restricted technology use to foster better learning elections officials in virginia recently traded computerized voting machines for more secure paper ballots and while reader sales have been tanking penguin just announced it would publish tiny printed books meant to be read on the go small books which have been around since gutenberg set up his press are an ideal solution for market that demands both convenience and physicality
these innovations aren xe mired in the past they are solutions firmly focused on the future xe not some technocentric version of it where we invent our way to utopia but human centric future that reflects where we xe ve been what we xe ve learned and how we actually want to live if that means we build more libraries in parks then we are moving in the right direction

madurai india xe the aravind eye hospital will treat anyone who comes through the door with or without money
each day more than people arrive from across india and sometimes other parts of the world crowding into the hallways and waiting rooms of this year old hospital at the southern end of the country on recent morning vt muthusamy ramalingamm local resident walked into room on the second floor sat down and rested his chin on small desktop device that pointed camera into his eyes
technician tapped on screen at the back of an eye scanner and within seconds diagnosis appeared on computer against the wall both eyes showed signs of diabetic retinopathy condition that can cause blindness if untreated
in most hospitals and clinics around the world trained physicians make this diagnosis examining patient xe eyes and identifying the tiny lesions hemorrhages and discoloration that anticipate diabetic blindness but aravind is trying to automate the process working with team of google artificial intelligence researchers based in california the hospital is testing system that can recognize the condition on its own
google and its sister company verily targeted this type of blindness because of its prevalence and because it is the sort of illness that an system can detect early google is not charging the hospital while it tests the technology
researchers hope this system will help doctors screen more patients in country where diabetic retinopathy is increasingly prevalent nearly million indians are diabetic according to the world health organization and all are at risk of blindness but the country does not train enough doctors to properly screen them all for every one million people in india there are only eye doctors according to the international council of ophthalmology
the project is part of widespread effort to build and deploy systems that can automatically detect signs of illness and disease in medical scans hospitals in the united states britain and singapore have also run clinical trials with systems that detect signs of diabetic blindness researchers across the globe are exploring technologies that detect cancer stroke heart disease and other conditions in rays and in and ct scans
last month regulators certified the eye system for use in europe under the verily name and the food and drug administration recently approved similar system in the united states but hospitals are treading lightly as they consider deploying systems that are vastly different from technology traditionally used for health care
aravind xe founder govindappa venkataswamy an iconic figure in india who was known as xe cdr xe and died in envisioned network of hospitals and vision centers that operate like mcdonald xe franchises systematically reproducing inexpensive forms of eye care for people across the country there are more than of the vision centers around india
in addition to screening patients in madurai xe one of the largest cities in southern india xe the hospital plans to install google xe technology in surrounding villages where few if any eye doctors are available the new system could radically expand the number of people who can be screened
xe cright now there is bottleneck when it comes to just screening patients xe said dr kim nephew of dr xe who now serves as chief medical officer at aravind
behind the new screening methods are neural networks complex mathematical systems that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data by analyzing millions of retinal scans showing signs of diabetic blindness neural network can learn to identify the condition on its own
neural network is the same technology that is rapidly improving face recognition services talking digital assistants driverless cars and instant translation services like google translate
because these systems learn from enormous amounts of information researchers are still struggling to completely understand how they work xe and how they will ultimately behave but some experts believe that once they are honed tested and properly deployed they can fundamentally improve health care
at aravind computer screens mounted on the walls of the waiting rooms translate information into the myriad languages spoken in the hospital
during his exam mr ramalingamm spoke tamil the ancient language of southern india and sri lanka he said he was comfortable with machine diagnosing his eye condition in part because it happened so quickly after the initial screening by the system doctors could treat the eyes perhaps with laser surgery to stave off blindness
the system performs on par with trained ophthalmologists according to study published in the journal of the american medical association but it is far from completely replacing doctor
earlier in the day pambaiyan balusamy sat in the same room the google system diagnosed xe cproliferative xe retinopathy in his left eye xe the most serious form of the condition xe but it could not read the scan of his right eye most likely because the eye had developed cataract
doctors can sometimes make diagnosis when faced with cataracts and blurry eye scans the google system still struggles to do this it is trained largely on clear unobstructed images of the retina though google is exploring the use of lower quality images
even with this limitation dr kim said the system can augment what doctors can do on their own aravind already operates small vision centers in many of the cities and villages surrounding madurai the hope is that the google system can make eye screening easier in these facilities and perhaps other locations across southern india
today in these vision centers technicians take eye scans and send them to doctors in madurai for review automated diagnosis can streamline and expand the process reaching more people in more places xe the kind of xe cmcdonaldization xe espoused by dr
the technology still faces regulatory hurdles in india in part because of the difficulty of navigating the country xe bureaucracy and though google xe eye system is now certified for use in europe it is still awaiting approval in the united states
luke oakden rayner the director of medical imaging research at the royal adelaide hospital in australia said these systems might even need new regulatory frameworks because existing rules weren xe always sufficient
xe ci am not convinced that people care enough about the safety of these systems xe he said
though these deep learning systems are new they are hardly the first effort to aid diagnosis through computer technology as dr oakden rayner pointed out software called breast cad xe approved by the food and drug administration in xe has been widely adopted in the united states to help with the detection of breast cancer in part because medicaid provides rebate when the technology is used but studies have shown that patient outcomes did not improve and in some cases declined
xe con paper the google system performs very well xe dr oakden rayner said xe cbut when you roll it out to huge population there can be problems that do not show up for years xe

what scientific topics are you most curious about and why
in your opinion what are the most pressing questions in science today why do you think these are so important
in xe things we xe really like to know xe new york times reporters celebrate the th anniversary of the science times section by offering up their thoughts on today xe most pressing questions in science here are few of the mysteries that pique their curiosity and what current research has to say about them
in xe does the universe still need einstein xe dennis overbye writes about physicists xe search for an explanation of the universe
more than anyone it was einstein who set the goal for modern science the search for final theory of everything xe cunified theory xe he said that would explain why there was no other way to put together the universe than the one we seem to live in xe xa
xe cthere are no laws of physics xe read the headline on an article in quanta the online science magazine last summer by robbert dijkgraaf the director of the institute for advanced study where einstein spent his last years
instead dr dijkgraaf wrote there is frighteningly complex xe clandscape xe of possibilities nearly infinite subtly connected network of complementary versions of reality there exists universe for every good or bad dream you xe ve ever had each with its own set of so called fundamental particles forces laws and dimensions
this landscape also known as the multiverse is the vision of string theorists who have vaulted past einstein in the current scientific imagination
in xe will we survive climate change xe john schwartz interviews kate marvel associate research scientist at the nasa goddard institute for space studies about the future of the planet
reports of the threats from warming planet have been coming fast and furiously the latest startling analysis from the intergovernmental panel on climate change predicting terrible food shortages wildfires and massive die off of coral reefs as soon as unless governments take strong action xe xa
xe cit xe worth pointing out there is no scientific support for inevitable doom xe she said
xe cclimate change is not pass fail xe she added xe cthere is real continuum of futures continuum of possibilities xe
so yes things will be bad and yes we need to do more so much more to head off what could come but how awful things get and for how many people depends on what we do
in xe how long can people live xe nicholas bakalar explores how scientists are trying to increase human longevity
one widely published researcher in the field jay olshansky professor of epidemiology at the university of illinois at chicago said that there is an upper limit to how long we can live xe about years
xe cparts of the body including the brain are not designed for long term use xe he said xe cwe xe re seeing the consequences of pushing the limits of survival the rise of alzheimer xe disease dementias joint and hip problems loss of muscle mass xe
xe cthese are not consequence of failure but of success xe he added dr olshansky advocates extending xe chealth span not life span xe
we will all die no serious scientist believes in immortality but we also are closer to assuring healthier old age than ever before
in xe how will we outsmart liars xe cade metz assesses the threat that artificial intelligence poses to humanity
neural network can learn to recognize dog by gleaning patterns from thousands of dog photos it can learn to identify spoken words by sifting through old tech support calls
and as the two researchers showed neural network can learn to write phishing messages by inspecting tweets reddit posts and previous online hacks
today the same mathematical technique is infusing machines with wide range of humanlike powers from speech recognition to language translation in many cases this new breed of artificial intelligence is also an ideal means of deceiving large numbers of people over the internet mass manipulation is about to get whole lot easier xe xa
ideally artificial intelligence could also provide ways of identifying and stopping this kind of mass manipulation mark zuckerberg likes to talk about the possibilities but for the foreseeable future we face machine learning arms race
and in xe honestly some questions are better left unanswered xe mr overbye argues that there are some mysteries that are better left alone
it xe not that don xe want them solved no worry that might be disappointed by the big reveal in the way old horror movies were scarier when you never saw the monster xe xa
don xe really want to know what xe in black hole the end of time another universe all your bad dreams my lost socks xe hate for any of those intriguing possibilities to be eliminated
nor do want to know what evolution has in store for us if knew how it was expected to go and tried to intervene probably would screw it up xe not as smart or as innovative as nature randomly shuffling the genetic deck
the fate of the universe feel the same way about it as feel about the future of the stock market entrusted with too much knowledge will make grave errors
students choose one of the articles and read it in its entirety then tell us
xe which of these questions intrigued you most and why what did you learn about it from reading the article and what is your reaction to the information what else do you want to know about the topic
xe which scientific mysteries do you want solved and why
xe what impact do you think research in this area could have on the world
xe mr overbye writes that there are some scientific mysteries that are better left unsolved do you agree what are some things that you would prefer not to find out why
xe what role does science journalism play in our society how does it serve the public in your opinion how important is it would you ever like to be science reporter why or why not
students and older are invited to comment all comments are moderated by the learning network staff but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted it will be made public

san francisco xe one of the poorest kept secrets in silicon valley has been the huge salaries and bonuses that experts in artificial intelligence can command now little noticed tax filing by research lab called openai has made some of those eye popping figures public
openai paid its top researcher ilya sutskever more than million in it paid another leading researcher ian goodfellow more than xe even though he was not hired until march of that year both were recruited from google
third big name in the field the roboticist pieter abbeel made though he did not join until june after taking leave from his job as professor at the university of california berkeley those figures all include signing bonuses
the figures listed on the tax forms which openai is required to release publicly because it is nonprofit provide new insight into what organizations around the world are paying for talent but there is caveat the compensation at openai may be underselling what these researchers can make since as nonprofit it can xe offer stock options
salaries for top researchers have skyrocketed because there are not many people who understand the technology and thousands of companies want to work with it element ai an independent lab in canada estimates that people worldwide have the skills needed to do serious research xe about double from year ago
xe cthere is mountain of demand and trickle of supply xe said chris nicholson the chief executive and founder of skymind start up working on
that raises significant issues for universities and governments they also need expertise both to teach the next generation of researchers and to put these technologies into practice in everything from the military to drug discovery but they could never match the salaries being paid in the private sector
in elon musk the chief executive of the electric car maker tesla and other well known figures in the tech industry created openai and moved it into offices just north of silicon valley in san francisco they recruited several researchers with experience at google and facebook two of the companies leading an industrywide push into artificial intelligence
in addition to salaries and signing bonuses the internet giants typically compensate employees with sizable stock options xe something that openai does not do but it has recruiting message that appeals to idealists it will share much of its work with the outside world and it will consciously avoid creating technology that could be danger to people
xe ci turned down offers for multiple times the dollar amount accepted at openai xe mr sutskever said xe cothers did the same xe he said he expected salaries at openai to increase as the organization pursued its xe cmission of ensuring powerful benefits all of humanity xe
openai spent about million in its first year with more than million going to salaries and other employee benefits it employed people in
people who work at major tech companies or have entertained job offers from them have told the new york times that specialists with little or no industry experience can make between and year in salary and stock top names can receive compensation packages that extend into the millions
xe cthe amount of money was borderline crazy xe wojciech zaremba researcher who joined openai after internships at google and facebook told wired while he would not reveal exact numbers mr zaremba said big tech companies were offering him two or three times what he believed his real market value was
at deepmind london lab now owned by google costs for employees totaled million in according to the company xe annual financial filings in britain that translates to per employee including researchers and other staff
researchers like mr sutskever specialize in what are called neural networks complex algorithms that learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data they are used in everything from digital assistants in smartphones to self driving cars
some researchers may command higher pay because their names carry weight across the community and they can help recruit other researchers
mr sutskever was part of three researcher team at the university of toronto that created key so called computer vision technology mr goodfellow invented technique that allows machines to create fake digital photos that are nearly indistinguishable from the real thing
xe cwhen you hire star you are not just hiring star xe mr nicholson of the start up skymind said xe cyou are hiring everyone they attract and you are paying for all the publicity they will attract xe
other researchers at openai including greg brockman who leads the lab alongside mr sutskever did not receive such high salaries during the lab xe first year
in according to the tax forms mr brockman who had served as chief technology officer at the financial technology start up stripe made as one of the founders of the organization however he most likely took salary below market value two other researchers with more experience in the field xe though still very young xe made between and in salary alone in according to the forms
though the pool of available researchers is growing it is not growing fast enough xe cif anything demand for that talent is growing faster than the supply of new researchers because is moving from early adopters to wider use xe mr nicholson said
that means it can be hard for companies to hold on to their talent last year after only months at openai mr goodfellow returned to google mr abbeel and two other researchers left the lab to create robotics start up embodied intelligence mr abbeel has since signed back on as part time adviser to openai and another researcher andrej karpathy left to become the head of at tesla which is also building autonomous driving technology
in essence mr musk was poaching his own talent since then he has stepped down from the openai board with the lab saying this would allow him to xe celiminate potential future conflict xe

washington xe america xe traditional adversaries will take advantage of the weakening of the postwar order and isolationist tendencies of the west to assert greater influence new strategy document from the director of national intelligence warned on tuesday
russian efforts to increase its influence are likely to continue and china is continuing its pursuit of xe ceconomic and territorial predominance in the pacific region xe the report said
the document compiled every four years is meant to guide the intelligence agencies xe broad strategic goals while it outlines the threat to the united states in broad terms it includes little in the way of details about specific threats from china russia or other countries
the leaders of american intelligence agencies are expected to testify to congress in early february with more fulsome assessment of the threats facing the country dan coats the director of national intelligence will most likely field questions at that hearing about china xe intensifying espionage activities and russia xe continuing efforts to interfere in democratic institutions in the united states and the rest of the west
adversaries are using not just traditional means of asserting strength in security matters but also hybrid and asymmetric means to gain political military and economic power according to the report
xe ctraditional adversaries will continue attempts to gain and assert influence taking advantage of changing conditions in the international environment xe including the weakening of the post wwii international order and dominance of western democratic ideals increasingly isolationist tendencies in the west and shifts in the global economy xe the report said
in setting priorities for the intelligence agencies the document echoes much of the direction of the strategy released in september
but the new document raises bigger concerns over counterintelligence threats the united states faces counterintelligence challenges from both foreign spy services and insider threats xe government employees and contractors who use their access to intelligence networks to xe cwittingly or unwittingly xe hurt american security xe according to the document
technological advances have helped foreign intelligence agencies xe cto field increasingly sophisticated capabilities and aggressively target the government private sector partners and academia xe those new technologies provide not only foreign intelligence agencies easier means to steal secrets but can also threaten critical infrastructure and weaken american influence
in speech to intelligence officials on tuesday mr coats said the new strategy urges the agencies to better use advanced technology to improve the tools that analysts and operatives use
mr coats recalled listening in to richard helms then the director talk about how the agency had developed method to keep its fax machine messages secret
xe che told us had learned to encrypt its signal and could transmit document at rate of six plus pages minute xe mr coats recalled xe cimagine that he pointed out that the entire encyclopaedia britannica could be sent from our headquarters to the state department in little over hours xe
new technologies will speed information transmission well beyond today xe internet let alone mr helms xe secret fax machine that technology mr coats said will change how the world and intelligence agencies operate he predicted that artificial intelligence and machine learning will enable american spy agencies to process all of the data they collect xe cinstead of being buried under it xe
xe cit xe constant struggle to process data analyze it and convert it into knowledge and understanding for our customers xe mr coats said xe cit xe one of our greatest challenges xe
mr coats also included in the strategy new section on transparency promising to share more information with the public
almost all of the work of the spy agencies remains shrouded in secrecy protected by classifications meant to protect sources and methods but also obscuring the analysis done by intelligence officers
mr coats said that he was committed to building public understanding of the intelligence community xe mission and that he wanted to see the agencies share more information with the public
xe cwe will be open about how we help protect the nation xe he said xe cand whenever possible we will share with the public the insight we offer to policymakers xe

xe xa trump will play the on his terms
xe xa charles koch may have forced his brother out
as president trump attends the group of summit fiercely at odds with other rich nations over trade it is important to understand how much has so far gone his way
if any country is currently well positioned to fight trade war it xe the united states its economy xe growth rate is relatively strong xe and it may now accelerate compared to other nations foreign trade makes up small percentage relatively of the economy which means it doesn xe depend heavily on access to world markets but other countries rely greatly on access to the as the country xe trade deficit shows as mr trump has ratcheted up his combative trade strategy there are few signs that the outcomes critics warned of xe stock market slump and an economic crunch xe are about to occur his detractors say his trade policy is incoherent yet when country has strong hand as the does it may matter less that its policies are not carefully choreographed
but the real test is approaching
next week the trump administration xe fight with china xe which could hit far more businesses than the tariffs on steel and aluminum now in effect xe enters crucial phase the administration is scheduled to release on june final list of chinese products covered by billion of tariffs it said that it will impose the tariffs shortly thereafter china has threatened to retaliate
the trump administration may end up stopping short of an all out trade war with china the compromise over zte the chinese electronics company subject to penalties is sign that mr trump is willing to give ground but it xe hard to see how he can quickly come away with deal that looks like an unequivocal victory the united states may get china to agree to buy certain amount of goods but such commitments would do almost nothing to tackle the underlying causes of the large trade deficit with china china has shown no indication for instance that will give up on its made in china program
the trump administration has two choices it can settle for relatively unambitious gains and try to spin them as significant investors would welcome that outcome voters may too alternatively mr trump can keep demanding big changes in china and possibly plunge the into drawn out trade war the imposition of the metals tariffs shows that he is willing to follow through but it xe still not clear how he will respond when his trade measures do significant harm to businesses or the financial markets
that moment may not be far away

the telecom giant said on friday that its chief executive of eight years lowell mcadam would be stepping down on august he xe ll remain chairman
replacing him will be hans vestberg currently the president of the company xe global networks
mr mcadam xe resignation comes after he engineered some of the most significant moves to adapt america xe biggest telecom company for digital era he bought full control of verizon xe wireless business from vodafone in in billion deal striking transaction that had been years in the making he also led verizon into the world of digital content buying companies like aol and yahoo
xe michael de la merced
during his tenure as verizon xe mr mcadam helped reshape the telecom giant xe and part of that was through deal making not all of the transactions were particularly flashy but they tended to follow one of two paths overhauling the company xe network operations or building up its digital media division which is now called oath
here are verizon xe top transactions since mr mcadam became in according to data from thomson reuters
xe xa billion buyout of vodafone xe stake in verizon xe wireless division in
xe xa billion acquisition of yahoo xe core internet business in
xe xa billion takeover of aol in
xe xa billion deal for straight path telecom company whose licenses for wireless spectrum the network airwaves that are important for data sending made it the subject of bidding war with at amp earlier this year
xe xa billion purchase of fleetmatics an irish company that helps companies manage employees on the road in
there were also big potential deals xe the takeovers of cbs and st century fox to name two xe that mr mcadam ended up not pursuing
xe xa verizon had asked shari redstone the media company xe controlling shareholder if it would ever come up for sale according to cbs xe lawsuit against ms redstone last month
xe xa it briefly looked at buying the assets of fox that walt disney ended up agreeing to acquire for billion including the th century fox movie studio and cable channels like fx
but in may mr mcadam told cnbc that he wasn xe interested in buying xe clinear xe properties xe that xe industry speak for traditional content creators more from that interview
we xe ve looked at that over the years and we made our decision to go digital that xe why we bought aol and yahoo and we talk now about superchannels of sports and finance and news and some entertainment
xe michael de la merced
in his seven years as verizon xe mr mcadam was known for his relentless focus on his company xe wireless network and his aversion to striking big splashy deals
as verizon prepares for the telecom industry xe future xe where the only certain things are the rise of wireless technology and online video streaming xe here xe what two research analysts think about what the company has done and where it xe headed
craig moffett moffettnathanson
mr mcadam will be defined by the deals that he didn xe do unlike at amp xe which paid nearly billion for the satellite tv service directv and is trying to acquire time warner for billion xe verizon never struck splashy acquisitions aside from those of yahoo and aol combined purchase price billion
but that conservatism has worked in verizon xe favor directv has steadily lost customers in this age of cord cutting dragging down at amp xe financial health
xe ci think he deserves lot of credit for avoiding some of the traps that some of his peers have fallen into xe mr moffett said of mr mcadam
as for the fear underpinning many telecom companies xe deal making xe that sticking to basic internet and phone service is boring xe mr moffett said verizon has shown that worry to be unfounded
xe cwhat xe so bad about being distribution channel xe he told me xe cverizon fully understood and embraced that there will always be place for an advantaged network xe and people will pay premium for it xe
amy yong macquarie
mr mcadam xe relentless focus on making verizon xe network the best in the has paid off handsomely with the company earning premium from investors based on the strength of its core business
the big question is whether that will be enough going forward as rivals at amp and mobile pursue bold moves
verizon xe cautious strategy may ending up costing the company though at amp xe bet on wireless video streaming hasn xe paid off yet if it works it will make that company formidable creator and distributor of content and mobile and sprint could prove to be strong new rival if their proposed union works out
xe cthe future is looking very different xe she said in telephone interview xe cwhat worked in the past may not be what works in the future xe

new report suggests that apple is preparing to sell fewer phones later this year it may sound worrying but we xe ve seen similar news before and the fallout is unlikely to be all that bad
nikkei reported on friday citing unnamed sources that apple has warned suppliers that it will order percent fewer components for its forthcoming iphones than it did for last year xe models that would obviously suggest that apple plans to sell fewer phones this year apple xe stock is down percent on the news
sound familiar sure apple has decreased orders for phones in the past the the the the it xe also shown that it sometimes errs on the side of conservatism ahead of phone debuts demand outstripped supply for its current flagship phone the shortly after it went on sale
the truth is that iphone sales have been erratic and sales are likely to struggle in the future because the smartphone market is mature xe most people have one already and incremental feature improvements mean users don xe need to upgrade as frequently it may also be expecting dip if its next device doesn xe push much beyond the technology inside the
but apple xe phones are getting more expensive so every sale counts for more and its services businesses xe things like music and pay xe are becoming an increasingly valuable revenue stream meaning that the company can make more money off existing users even if they don xe upgrade to the latest device

the job faced by investigators of car collisions is getting more difficult as autonomous car features become more advanced and the way they do their jobs might need to change to accommodate that
in march tesla model collided with concrete lane divider as it was driven down highway in mountain view calif new report by national transportation safety board investigators suggested that tesla xe autopilot technology played role in the death of tesla owner
from the report
the driver was using the advanced driver assistance features traffic aware cruise control and autosteer lane keeping assistance which tesla refers to as xe cautopilot xe as the tesla approached the paved gore area dividing the main travel lanes of us from the sh exit ramp it moved to the left and entered the gore area the tesla continued traveling through the gore area and struck previously damaged crash attenuator at speed of about mph
but it xe interesting to consider where the information used to draw those kinds of conclusions actually comes from the information today reports on how data about autonomy features isn xe necessarily collected by default on the recorders that are accessible to many crash investigators such as those employed by insurance firms
information isn xe recorded in most cars xe event data recorders the automotive equivalent of airplane black boxes instead the boxes show more basic information such as steering wheel input and throttle
while automakers commonly provide the information if it is requested by the vehicle owner accident investigators xe typically contractors hired by insurance companies xe say they sometimes have to seek court order to obtain crash data
an update to the rules published by the national highway traffic safety administration could change that situation by demanding that automakers log more details about the vehicle xe behavior

the complexity of the mathematical calculations involved means it xe not straightforward to take the network apart to understand how it makes its decisions this can make unintended behavior hard to predict and if failure does occur it can be difficult to explain why if system misrecognizes an object in photo for instance it may be hard though not impossible to know what feature of the image led to the error
many artificial intelligence researchers are trying to develop ways to make it easier to understand the inner working of systems but for now that xe likely to involve looking at complex computer code that suggests that crash investigation teams as well as the regulations that are applied to automakers might require an update in the near future too

turning point facebook and twitter removed or suspended millions of pages groups and accounts in an effort to combat bots and trolls
on june the bbc evening news opener broke down for four minutes breaking news animation alternated random still pictures with tracking shots of presenter who sat stoically in silence the elements of the familiar sequence were jumbled messed up and nonsensical
the scene was the result of technical glitch xe system crash but it also served as an image of automation run amok of decades of breaking news finally resulting in broken news
the message still resonates in this new age of artificial stupidity technological disruption has turned destructive its greatest victim is reality itself
it is far cry from an earlier period of digital expansion when internet communication was seen to promote global exchange and understanding the time when the word xe cglobal xe was likely to attach to the word xe cdigital xe is most definitely over the new elites in many western countries are no longer cosmopolitan and globalist but rather isolationist and identitarian before technology was supposed to connect and mediate the online world seemed like disney vision of multiculturalism promoting sterile tolerance from above now technology divides and fragments it identifies and ranks people
xc xa ria schmidt historian close to hungary xe illiberal leader viktor orban argues that automation and artificial intelligence will reduce the demand for labor and thus for migration so automation not only disadvantages local workers but also benefits closed and homogeneous societies it also wrecks the public conversation via bots and botnets impersonating real people spreading viral disinformation and broken news
this rise of artificial stupidity is the antithesis of or rather the millions of shabby little cousins to artificial intelligence just as socialism in practice has been far cry from the glorious promises of revolutionaries artificial stupidity is mediocre and greedy version of the sublime machine intelligence intended to elevate and improve human life
all sorts of minor communication applications are artificial stupidities and though they may not seem impressive their real world effects are baffling the destruction of public discourse and the polarization of populations wages and hours managed by algorithms customer service clerical counseling or legal work eliminated by virtual assistants or chatbots
even simple things such as buying ticket for plane train or concert have become arduous and frustrating chores in an era of targeted opaque pricing instead of common reality and set of rules that apply to everyone we have frustration dysfunction and waste of precious time and energy
and automation is not alone in chipping away at modern society the few platforms that effectively own the digital communication sphere today operate without serious checks and balances or even basic competition in an open market their algorithms are proprietary and unknown there are few alternatives if any for consumers
the result is an endless cycle of broken news and quarter truths stretched and repurposed ad nauseam because in the age of artificial stupidity truth is traded for popularity and reach
the norms of reality tv have found foothold in the digital age the point is not that there is no reality xe the point is that it xe every fact for itself competing against all others while social media multiply alternative versions of it if you don xe like the reality you are facing there is always another one custom made for your preferences
this is our real existing digital world nothing more than hourly waves of feverish and toxic agitation played out over stale mainstream channels that discourage innovation and experimentation drown in excruciating advertisements and drain people xe attention and souls
an unpopular truth cannot survive online in such world because traction is privileged over veracity and to artificially stupid automatons and algorithms reality is defined as brute quantity by ranking ratings and elimination
the truth doesn xe fit into that mold
the truth is piece of work with unruly and messy details that nevertheless require attention and never fully add up it is usually much too complicated to be entertaining and it may not be to everyone xe liking at all it may not make things easier or more efficient xe quite the opposite in fact if truth is not marketable item like clean environments or livable neighborhoods the platforms that manage digital communication seem to show little interest in maintaining it letting broken news propagate
as result fake reports digital rumors and conspiracy theories have moved from fringe to mainstream they have also created new reality as write this mob is marching through the east german town of chemnitz yelling anti migrant slogans and chasing nonwhite people they are not brandishing pitchforks they are more likely to wield cellphones
after all in germany facebook activity correlates with white supremacist violence racist gatherings are organized in matter of hours on social media and algorithms built into platforms amplify social division and benefit extremist organizations digital technology augments authoritarian movements and the digital native segues seamlessly into the digital nativist
facts on the other hand are often quite unspectacular they will not improve and may even deteriorate if they are xe cliked xe or shared and both facts and the truth rely on strong institutions not consumers to defend them judiciaries scientific communities an independent press it is no coincidence that all those institutions are being undermined in many countries around the world xe see the rioters in chemnitz fuming at the xe clying press xe the defunding of scientific research throughout the western world or attempts at the partisan realignment of judicial institutions such as poland xe supreme court
there are many short term solutions to help prevent the further onslaught of broken news challenging or regulating monopoly platforms is one of them making their algorithms transparent and open to public assessment legislation and debate is another we can ban bots and anonymous accounts from social media and strengthen institutions with durable and tested rules to establish and confirm facts
but we cannot have our factuality cake and eat it too truth will rarely be popular or profitable to expect its popularity to correspond to its veracity is not even artificially stupid but just stupid

december was big month for advocates of regulating artificial intelligence first bipartisan group of senators and representatives introduced the future of act the first federal bill solely focused on it would create an advisory committee to make recommendations about xe on topics including the technology xe effect on the american work force and strategies to protect the privacy rights of those it impacts then the new york city council approved first of its kind bill that once signed into law will create task force to examine its own use of automated decision systems with the ultimate goal of making its use of algorithms fairer and more transparent
perhaps not coincidentally these efforts also overlap with increasing calls to regulate artificial intelligence along with claims by the likes of elon musk and stephen hawking that it poses threat to humanity xe literal survival
but this push for broad legislation to regulate is premature
to begin with even experts can xe agree on what exactly constitutes artificial intelligence take the recent report released by the ai now institute aimed at creating framework for ethically implementing while itself focused on the report also acknowledges that no commonly accepted definition of exists which it describes loosely as xe ca broad assemblage of technologies xe xa that have traditionally relied on human capacities xe
xe cartificial intelligence xe is all too frequently used as shorthand for software that simply does what humans used to do but replacing human activity is precisely what new technologies accomplish xe spears replaced clubs wheels replaced feet the printing press replaced scribes and so on what xe new about is that this technology isn xe simply replacing human activities external to our bodies it xe also replacing human decision making inside our minds
the challenges created by this novelty should not obscure the fact that itself is not one technology or even one singular development regulating an assemblage of technology we can xe clearly define is recipe for poor laws and even worse technology
indeed the challenges poses aren xe entirely new we xe ve already successfully regulated it in the past xe we just didn xe call it xe cartificial intelligence xe in the and for example the financial industry began to rely on complex statistical modeling and huge computerized databases to make credit decisions automating what had been more manual process of approving or denying credit to borrowers
those ethical and legal challenges associated with these models so captivated the public xe attention that in the summer of newsweek ran cover story titled xe cis privacy dead xe detailing the xe cmassive flanking attack xe of computers on modern society growing awareness of that threat led to broad appeals that echo modern proposals to regulate xe ceventually we have to set up an agency to regulate the computers xe senator sam ervin of north carolina said in
but instead of regulating all computers the government sought targeted approach tailored to specific problems passing regulations like the equal credit opportunity act in that act was meant to reduce credit discrimination against minority groups and to increase consumers xe ability to understand what the models were doing xe if consumers didn xe like their credit score thanks to the act they could at least know how it could be improved
that law and others offer valuable lessons today illustrating the importance of focusing on specific issues xe in this case transparency in credit decisions xe and tailoring their solutions accordingly any regulation aimed at the range of systems we call xe ca xe should seek to be just as specific
with the thorny exception of cybersecurity the way the united states regulatory system has approached information technology is arguably the most successful model for regulating technology in existence xe fostering innovation while ensuring that the technology we use doesn xe break or seriously jeopardize our safety the backbone of this approach comprises regulations tailored to the explicit problems created by any given technology
within the united states xe vast framework of laws and regulatory agencies already lie answers to some of the most vexing challenges created by in the financial sector for example the federal reserve enforces regulation called sr which addresses the risks created by the complex algorithms used by today xe banks sr xe solution to those challenges is called xe ceffective challenge xe which seeks to embed critical analysis into every stage of an algorithm xe life cycle xe from thoroughly examining the data used to train the algorithm to explicitly outlining the assumptions underlying the model and more while sr is among the most detailed attempts at governing the challenges of complex algorithms it xe also one of the most overlooked
this is not of course to suggest that artificial intelligence should never be regulated but if the past is any guide treating it as collection of separate technologies in separate sectors is destined to be the most effective way to control the benefits it creates xe and the dangers it poses

jared guynes has hundreds of apps on his mobile phone so when mr guynes year old from rockwall tex took his family to chili xe grill amp bar and saw an ad offering free chips and salsa if he downloaded the restaurant xe app he didn xe hesitate
then within minutes of leaving the restaurant last month he received flurry of push notifications one offering another discount one asking him to take survey and third asking to add his location
xe ci thought chill out chili xe xe said mr guynes who said he was considering deleting the app xe clet me get home and digest the food xe chili xe did not respond to request for comment
the brand app is no longer just gimmick to assuage smartphone addicted millennials it xe considered crucial part of company xe financial strategy shoppers in the united states were expected to make billion in retail purchases through their smartphones in up from billion in according to forrester analytics
xe cif you xe re brand and you don xe have an app strategy or you aren xe investing in your app development then its going to be really hard for you to engage and monetize the fastest growing population which are mobile shoppers xe said jon hudson vice president of customer solutions and innovation at criteo digital marketing and technology firm
but as more companies bombard shoppers with emails fliers and in store ads that push them to download their brand apps people are getting savvier xe and less forgiving if they feel an app xe performance is subpar
there is little hesitation about dumping brand app that is slow crashes has poor layout doesn xe offer exclusive sales or promotions or pushes too many notifications
recent study by the digital product developer willowtree inc showed almost half of those surveyed found percent or fewer of the brand apps to be useful after downloading them and about percent had deleted more than half of their brand apps
apps can be valuable tools for companies they can track customer xe interests by seeing the person xe browsing and buying activity and then use the data to customize ads discounts and promotions to keep the customer coming back many brands are even using machine learning or artificial intelligence to fine tune their promotions
to entice people to download an app companies often offer one time discounts entry into sweepstakes giveaway or registration into warranty program but getting people to come back requires more
more than percent of the people in the willowtree survey said they wanted exclusive access to sales limited edition products and events and to be rewarded with loyalty points or other perks for making purchase through the app
and navigating the app must be simple
panera bread xe app has been hit with more than million downloads and million people opening the app each month the app makes it fast and easy for people to place orders track food deliveries in real time and get mypanera loyalty rewards when they place orders through the app said blaine hurst the company xe chief executive it also offers other features like its nutritional calculator which tallies up calories fat and other metrics as the person custom builds sandwich panera expects to receive million in sales through its app this year
giving customers reason to come back to the app on daily or weekly basis is critical to its success xe cif the app isn xe really bringing an experience or providing constantly changing data or some sort of loyalty users aren xe going to be driven to the app xe said eric mackenzie the vice president of technology at the digital marketing agency
regal cinemas overhauled its app in january to allow customers to buy tickets directly through the app instead of redirecting customers to the fandango site this made it faster and easier to buy tickets and led to surge in people joining regal xe loyalty program it sends notifications about new movies contests or even free studio screenings based on person xe past purchases superhero buff for instance most likely received notifications when tickets for xe cdeadpool xe went on sale said ken thewes regal xe chief marketing officer
regal frequently adds perks like the augmented reality feature it recently introduced more than million people have downloaded the app
the walgreens app has been downloaded more than million times and has million people actively using it each month users come to the app for its discount coupons as well as helpful pharmacy features such as daily pill reminders notifications for prescription refills the ability to speak with pharmacists through pharmacy chat and loyalty rewards points for those who use the app to track walking cycling weight management and other activities said adam holyk chief marketing officer at walgreens
fashion retailers like zulily and touch of modern send push notifications about daily flash sales to keep customers coming back to their apps the flash sales create xe can urgency to purchase xe said kevin saliba senior vice president of marketing at zulily
still experts warn that bad app experience can destroy customer xe relationship with the brand and many users won xe give an app second chance after it xe been deleted no matter how many times it gets upgraded
xe cit xe not even like baseball where three strikes and you xe re out xe said mr guynes the somewhat dissatisfied chili xe app user xe cthis is some crazy game where one strike and you xe re out xe

seattle xe facebook and google are under the microscope for the ways their technologies can spread misinformation while amazon xe growing market power is regular target of president trump and apple pioneered the modern smartphone device increasingly seen as too addicting
then there xe microsoft giant that spent most of the and early as tech xe biggest company and villain it now seems to be auditioning for different role the industry xe moral conscience
among the five most valuable tech companies microsoft is the only one to avoid sustained public criticism about contributing to social ills in the last couple of years at the same time satya nadella its chief executive and brad smith its president have emerged as some of the most outspoken advocates in the industry for protecting user privacy and establishing ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence
on monday the conscientious side of microsoft was on display again at build three day conference for developers in seattle mr nadella announced program for accessibility that will award million over five years to researchers nonprofits and developers who use artificial intelligence to help people with disabilities mr nadella whose adult son was born with cerebral palsy has written about how his son xe disability helped make him more empathetic
echoing theme he talked about at the conference last year mr nadella said the industry had responsibility to build technology that empowered everyone
xe cwe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do xe he said
microsoft xe new role is partly due to the fact that the company isn xe major player in social media video streaming and smartphones xe the products behind the current dark mood around tech it no longer squeezes the oxygen out of markets as amazon can
but while the company xe power has diminished since couple of decades ago when it controlled computing through windows microsoft remains an influential voice on monday its market capitalization of billion made it the third most valuable technology company behind apple and amazon and ahead of google parent company alphabet and facebook
xe cthe irony for microsoft is that they lost in search they lost in social networks and they lost in mobile and as consequence they have avoided the recent pushback from governments and media xe said david yoffie professor at the harvard business school xe cthis has given microsoft the freedom to take the high road as the ethical leader in technology xe
since taking the reins at microsoft in mr nadella has brought more sensitive style of leadership to the company than his two predecessors steve ballmer and bill gates that shift has proved to be more suitable for microsoft in this era
two decades ago microsoft was depicted as bully that ran roughshod over competitors in landmark antitrust suit brought by the federal government followed by similar cases brought by the european union and private companies mr smith was brought in to make peace in microsoft xe antitrust battles and mr nadella was the company xe first chief executive to start in the job since those suits were settled
in phone interview mr smith who is also microsoft xe chief legal officer called its legal problems in past decades xe cgut wrenching experience xe that had shaped microsoft in its current form xe cit made microsoft better and more responsible company xe he said
this year microsoft published book that outlined some of the harmful effects that could come from artificial intelligence such as bias in job recruiting it has litigated four lawsuits against the united states government over the past five years in efforts to defend customers xe privacy rights one of them fight over law enforcement access to data stored in an overseas microsoft data center went to the supreme court which dropped the case after congress enacted law that mooted it
xe cnot only did microsoft learn from its mistakes satya is unique and caring individual xe said tim xe reilly tech industry publisher and conference organizer xe che understands deeply that microsoft must help others to succeed xe
the closest analog among mr nadella xe peers is tim cook the chief executive of apple who has painted apple as staunch defender of its customers xe privacy he has jabbed at facebook and google both advertising supported businesses that profit from the personal data they collect from their users contrast to apple xe business model of selling devices
facebook and google which owns youtube have defended their advertising businesses for allowing them to deliver services for free they xe ve promised to add more human moderators and invest in software tools that can screen out misinformation and other prohibited content
mr cook has not turned his ire toward microsoft which gets most of its revenue from software hardware and cloud computing services the company has investments in internet services that are supported in part by advertising including its bing search engine and linkedin the social network for professionals it acquired in
mr nadella has been more hesitant than mr cook to publicly criticize other technology companies turning to more subtle types of persuasion low key leader mr nadella peppers his speeches and interviews with references to literature warning that careless creators of technology could contribute to dystopian world of george orwell xe xe xe or aldous huxley xe xe cbrave new world xe his lieutenant mr smith has become ubiquitous ambassador for microsoft on the big social issues facing technology in washington in brussels and on the conference circuit
microsoft is still occasionally cast in the role of villain california man who sold recycled electronic waste recently pleaded guilty for creating thousands of unauthorized discs that helped people restore the windows operating system on refurbished pcs the recycler who has been sentenced to months in prison has said microsoft supported the case against him which was brought by federal prosecutors because he threatened part of its business microsoft published long blog post that portrayed his actions unfavorably
still the microsoft of is long way from the company that was once portrayed as corporate predator
xe cmicrosoft lived through negativity that these companies are experiencing now and it doesn xe want to go back to those days xe said vivek wadhwa distinguished fellow with carnegie mellon university xe silicon valley campus
mr smith of microsoft said the greater scrutiny on the tech sector would not always fall on the same companies
xe cat any given moment there may be one or two companies in the spotlight xe he said xe ci don xe think one should assume the same one or two are always going to be in the spotlight or always on the defensive xe

amazon yesterday canceled its plans to build huge corporate campus in new york city
xe xa the decision was an abrupt turnabout after yearlong search for second headquarters the tech giant ultimately decided to open two new sites xe in queens and in virginia each would have gained an estimated jobs
xe xa but amazon faced backlash in new york from lawmakers activists and union leaders who said it didn xe deserve nearly billion in government incentives
xe xa xe cthe company made its decision late wednesday after growing increasingly concerned that the backlash in new york showed no sign of abating and was tarnishing its image beyond the city xe david goodman of the nyt writes
xe xa xe clooking at the opposition and the timeline we decided we don xe want to work in this environment in the long term xe jodi seth the head of policy communications for amazon told nbc news
this could be turning point for corporate civic relations it will surely change how companies think about doing business in certain states and cities it xe also likely to make political leaders xe especially in democratic regions xe reconsider offering tax incentives to lure business one big question here should states and cities be allowed to offer subsidies to business in the first place
it xe also clear sign that leftist views are gaining traction the news is short term win for progressive politicians like representative alexandria ocasio cortez who are championing what they say are socialist messages ms ocasio cortez appeared to revel in the decision on twitter saying that xe canything is possible xe but in the longer term those lawmakers may face backlash if the loss of those jobs in long island city hurts the local economy
and it raises questions about the wider understanding of finance xe cn wasn xe handing cash to amazon it was an incentive program based on job creation producing tax revenue xe andrew tweeted xe cthere isn xe billion pile of money that can now be spent on subways or education xe

while we were obsessing over the self obsessive one people who take much longer view of things have been debating the question of whether trees talk to one another experience pain have sex and send out signals of distress about the imminent collapse of this little planet of ours
trees are sociable it turns out and even somewhat selfless nurturing their drought stricken or wounded arboreal siblings they share nutrients they suffer when big arm is lopped during the growing season or crown is next to an all night light some trees warn other trees of danger by releasing chemical drifts
found these relatively new discoveries not long after giant fir came crashing down in my front yard during freakish windstorm nearly crushing my family and our century old house we were spared by six inches but question remained what was the big guy trying to say
perhaps it has something to do with the million trees that died from climate change aggravated drought and beetle infestation in california or the five million acres of formerly sylvan green wiped out in colorado by the same plague or maybe it xe president who dictated the largest single rollback of public land protection in our history putting national monument and its ancient flora at risk from predators with political connections
trees are fighting back helped by others doing the talking for them sadly we are past the point when an appeal to our better angels does any good xe cit is worse than boorish it is criminal to inflict an unnecessary injury on the tree that feeds or shadows us xe wrote henry david thoreau xe cold trees are our parents and our parents xe parents perchance xe lovely sentiment but largely futile
instead in this moment of mercenary politics those of us who are out proud tree huggers have taken to citing the bottom line and the winning argument here is simple trees are vast source of wealth single national forest the million acre mount baker snoqualmie east of seattle may be worth more in total value than the annual revenue of amazon the world xe largest online retailer according to recent study by the wilderness society
the clean water timber cultural and recreation opportunities of this one forest deliver more economic value than all of the failing american coal industry the entire outdoor recreation sector generates at least billion in gross domestic product more than the gas oil and mining industry the government reported this year
xe ci have mixed feelings about monetizing the geography of hope xe said peter jackson writer and conservationist using one of the best known phrases of wallace stegner wilderness in the cascade mountains is named for his late father senator henry jackson giant of congress from an era when support for purple mountain majesties was bipartisan
so why is the trump administration trying to prop up unprofitable coal plants in move that could cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars while an unsubsidized industry based on nature xe glories has to fight the administration plus coal burning one of the biggest producers of earth warming carbon is an indirect killer of those life supporting and economy enhancing forests
the president is fossil fool but beyond that he xe never taken view that extends to the world that ivanka xe grandchildren will inherit his bias for dirty th century energy is based on pleasing coal industry that has gone from employing people in the to barely now if the free market philosophy were still the bedrock principle of governing republicans coal would be left to the creative destruction of capitalism
beyond the economic value trees force us to measure time in epochs in victor hugo planted tree outside his home in exile on the island of guernsey his hope was that when the little sapling was mighty oak europe would be unified the european union and hugo xe plant are still standing though the tree may be in better shape than the
spruce in sweden which sprouted sometime after the last ice age is years old having survived all the upheavals of history and weather but will it live through the current era
in xe cthe hidden life of trees xe an international best seller by peter wohlleben and xe cthe overstory xe masterful new novel by richard powers forests are main characters crying to be heard in the summer powers writes water traveling through single chestnut xe cdisperses out of the million tiny mouths of the undersides of leaves hundred gallons day evaporating from the tree xe airy crown into the humid iowa air xe
some scientists think it xe wrong to anthropomorphize trees they aren xe sentient life forms and can xe really xe ctalk xe like that grumpy apple tree dorothy encounters on the way to oz but surely they communicate through system that foresters compare to the neural networks of humans it xe worth listen

the american gambling industry and its regulators have an opportunity to police digital sports betting they should take it before fraud becomes rife
wagering on sporting events has evolved rapidly overseas in recent years in europe asia and australia gambling on events while using xe cin play wagering xe and live data feeds more closely resembles the trading environment on the nasdaq than las vegas sportsbook
legalized sports betting is now on its way to broader rollout in the united states in may the supreme court struck down more than year old law that effectively banned commercial sports betting in most states number of states have already moved to allow the practice
many bookmakers have made efforts to limit fraud and manipulation but more can be done to ensure level playing field regulators and sporting bodies would be wise to learn the lessons of the financial industry and adopt range of policies and surveillance tools while the market in the united states for sports betting is still nascent
many investors regulators and capital market players were caught flat footed when markets were computerized decades ago new digital products and trading methods created fresh forms of electronic manipulation and unintended consequences that were difficult to track within sea of data authorities took months for example to trace and explain the causes of the flash crash of may
the cost to the financial industry of catching up with the bad behavior was significantly higher than if it had invested in defensive technologies at the start the united states has taken years to start the consolidated audit trail and it is estimated to have cost the industry over million in its first year
many systems for monitoring the integrity of sports betting around the world look at odds or prices across bookmakers this type of approach was abandoned in financial markets over years ago because it does not provide the granularity needed to properly police trading
the systems that monitor financial markets today are much more powerful and can handle large volumes of data nasdaq xe smarts stock market surveillance software for instance can handle over billion events per day and can detect manipulative activity in real time monitoring bets alongside live feeds of events will be crucial to understanding possible manipulation particularly as result of wagering during game
individual bookmakers monitor their own customers very closely but policing marketplace requires more than simply trusting its participants even monitoring the entire market only at the price level could still allow nefarious activity spread across multiple bookmakers to go unnoticed
to truly oversee sports betting markets regulators should require licensed operators to share all transactional betting data so that it can be examined for patterns known to indicate irregular activity cooperation across states is also important so that as large slice of the market as possible can be monitored
surveillance technology can be major factor in how well new market operates and enforces safe level playing field these systems should be able to handle high volumes of data and have some level of machine learning capability as the quantity of data the range of products and the sophistication of traders grow within sports betting these new technologies will become necessary
as market operator and technology company we fully endorse this necessity
there is vast gray or black market in wagering that exists beyond our shores but with this new opportunity the united states has unique chance to set an example by overseeing this marketplace with integrity
scott shechtman is head of new markets market technology at nasdaq and tony sio is head of marketplace and regulator surveillance market technology at nasdaq

it xe human nature it seems to resist change and fear the unknown so it is no surprise that genetic engineering of food and feed crops resulted in their resounding condemnation as xe cfrankenfoods xe by many consumers who seem as terrified of eating an apple with an added anti browning gene or pink pineapple genetically enriched with the antioxidant lycopene as am of self driving cars
trek down the grocery aisles of any large market and you xe ll find many products prominently labeled xe cno xe it xe much harder to spot the small print on many other foods stating xe cpartially produced with genetic engineering xe result of federal law that mandated uniform labeling of all food products containing genetically engineered ingredients
the labeling requirement arose in response to public pressure and confusing array of state rules but while endorse the public xe right to know and honest labeling of all products in an important way it is very misleading farmers and agricultural scientists have been genetically engineering the foods we eat for centuries through breeding programs that result in large and largely uncontrolled exchanges of genetic material what many consumers may not realize for many decades in addition to traditional crossbreeding agricultural scientists have used radiation and chemicals to induce gene mutations in edible crops in attempts to achieve desired characteristics
modern genetic engineering differs in two ways only one or few new genes with known function are introduced into crop and sometimes the new genes come from an unrelated species thus gene meant to instill frost tolerance into say spinach might come from fish that lives in icy waters
in the decades since the first genetically modified foods reached the market no adverse health effects among consumers have been found this is not to say there are none but as hard as opponents of the technology have looked none have yet been definitely identified
although about percent of scientists believe are safe xe view endorsed by the american medical association the national academy of sciences the american association for the advancement of science and the world health organization xe only slightly more than third of consumers share this belief
it is not possible to prove food is safe only to say that no hazard has been shown to exist the fears of are still theoretical like the possibility that insertion of one or few genes could have negative impact on other desirable genes naturally present in the crop
among commonly expressed concerns xe again none of which have been clearly demonstrated xe are unwanted changes in nutritional content the creation of allergens and toxic effects on bodily organs according to an interview in scientific american with robert goldberg plant molecular biologist at the university of california los angeles such fears have not yet been quelled despite xe chundreds of millions of genetic experiments involving every type of organism on earth and people eating billions of meals without problem xe
establishing long term safety would require prohibitively expensive decades of study of hundreds of thousands of consumers and their non counterparts
meanwhile number of impressive benefits have been well established for example an analysis of studies published in february in scientific reports by researchers in pisa italy found that genetically engineered corn has significantly higher yield than non genetically modified varieties and contains lower amounts of toxins commonly produced by fungi
both effects most likely stem from the genetically engineered resistance to major insect pest the western corn rootworm which damages ears of corn and allows fungi to flourish the researchers said that the change has had little or no effect on other insects
by engineering resistance to insect damage farmers have been able to use fewer pesticides while increasing yields which enhances safety for farmers and the environment while lowering the cost of food and increasing its availability yields of corn cotton and soybeans are said to have risen by percent to percent through the use of genetic engineering
billions of edible animals are raised in this country each year on feed containing with no evidence of harm in fact animal health and growth efficiency actually improved on the genetically engineered feed according to review in the journal of animal science
wider adoption of genetic engineering especially in african and asian countries that still spurn the technology could greatly increase the food supply in areas where climate change will increasingly require that crops can grow in dry and salty soils and tolerate temperature extremes continue to be distressed by the resistance to golden rice crop genetically engineered to supply more vitamin than spinach that could prevent irreversible blindness and more than million deaths year
nonetheless gene modification scientists are focusing increasingly on building health benefits into widely used foods in addition to pink pineapples containing the tomato based antioxidant lycopene tomatoes are being engineered to contain the antioxidant rich purple pigment from blueberries
and people in developing countries faced with famine and malnutrition are likely to benefit from attempts to improve the protein content of food crops as well as the amount of vitamins and minerals they provide
this is not to say that everything done in the name of genetic engineering has clean bill of health controversy abounds over the use of genetically modified seeds that produce crops like soy corn canola alfalfa cotton and sorghum that are resistant to widely used herbicide glyphosate the health effects of which are still unclear
in the latest development resistance to second weed killer has been combined with glyphosate resistance although the combination product called enlist duo was approved in by the environmental protection agency has been linked to an increase in non hodgkin xe lymphoma and number of neurological disorders researchers reported in the international journal of environmental research and public health
the bottom line consumers concerned about the growing use of in the foods they depend on might consider taking more nuanced approach than blanket opposition rather than wholesale rejection take some time to learn about how genetic engineering works and the benefits it can offer now and in the future as climate change takes an ever greater toll on food supplies consider supporting efforts that result in safe products that represent improvements over the original and focusing opposition on those that are less desirable

several years ago achievement first charter school network serving primarily low income black and hispanic students got an unpleasant wake up call its students had done well on tests but fewer than third of its high school graduates were earning college degrees on time that was better than the percent national college completion rate for students from low income backgrounds but it was far below the network xe hopes
and it raised question was the schools xe highly structured disciplined approach to behavior and learning giving students the tools they needed to succeed at the next level
achievement first is not the only charter wrestling with that issue xe cthat is one of the questions everybody xe been asking as they design high schools xe dave levin one of the co founders of the kipp network said in an interview
in response achievement first xe leaders set about designing new school model that they hope can maintain their high expectations and strict rules while letting students develop independence and sense of identity
some think it will be difficult xe cthere is real dilemma confronting xe no excuses xe charter networks as they shift their instructional model to encourage deeper learning xe shael polakow suransky the president of the bank street college of education said in an email their focus on discipline he said xe ccan undermine the autonomy and student voice so critical to developing independent thinkers xe
and even as achievement first was honing its new model which it calls xe cgreenfield xe in students at its new haven high school achievement first amistad high school held walkout to demand racial diversity on the staff and fairer discipline
for now the network is only using the greenfield model in two new middle schools in brooklyn and providence and in kindergarten through sixth grade school in new haven that gradually adopted the approach over the last two years the network has schools in all serving some students
the model emphasizes what the network calls xe cstudent directed xe or online learning three times year special classes called expeditions meant to allow students to explore their interests and discover possible careers social emotional curriculum focused on developing students xe sense of identity and community and beefed up role for parents and other caregivers and mentors the aim is to cultivate students who are more self directed and resilient as well as to give parents confidence in their ability to support their children through the challenges of college
dacia toll the network xe co chief executive officer said that those goals came out of intensive research in which consultants interviewed parents staff and alumni many alumni said that they found the transition to college difficult
xe cone said xe in college you have to teach yourself more than half the content on your own xe xe ms toll said that is very different from what is required in high school she said xe cand that sort of led to the whole concept of self directed learning xe
inspired by summit public schools charter network based in silicon valley achievement first built its own online platform to teach humanities math and science along with vocabulary and grammar students are expected to complete online units by certain dates and get weekly progress reports sent home
ms toll said the program cultivated students xe ability to work autonomously and also instilled the kind of historical and scientific background knowledge that is critical to reading comprehension and significant cause of the achievement gap between students from high and low income backgrounds
for much of the day each classroom is split in two with one teacher working more traditionally with half of the students while second teacher supervises students wearing noise canceling headphones and working on their own on laptops
at achievement first aspire middle school in brooklyn on day in november that meant half of the fifth graders in one room were discussing xe ca long walk to water xe novel set during the second sudanese civil war while the other half of the class read or watched videos about ancient greece on their computers to ensure the students working online were absorbing information they had to fill in answers in workbook as they progressed when student wanted to take the end of unit online test the teacher looked over the workbook first
larry cuban an emeritus professor of education at stanford university who has written about summit xe high schools said he believed that teachers xe use of the online learning platform there held promise summit created the platform as part of an overhaul of its model several years ago after it too found that its graduates were dropping out of college at alarmingly high rates
mr cuban said he was particularly impressed with the way that summit schools asked students to set goals for themselves
xe cwhen they set their own goals the teacher can say xe why are you doing this why do you want to work on these skills xe xe he said xe cyou xe ll hear kids say xe well feel that this is important to me because xe ve done poorly here xe or xe need help here xe that kind of openness and honesty in conversation between teacher and kid or between kids is not common in schools xe
but he added that he thought the impact of online teaching tools depended on how they were implemented and that the ultimate test for both summit and for achievement first would be what happens to college graduation rates
achievement first xe greenfield model also emphasizes setting goals twice week students meet with teacher referred to as xe cgoal coach xe to go over their progress in different areas and set goals for the week
but tanesha forman fifth grade teacher at elm city college preparatory elementary school the greenfield school in new haven said she thought that she and her colleagues still had ways to go in giving students autonomy
xe ci think we xe re very proactive xe like if we see scholars are not where they need to be we xe re like xe here xe what you need to do xe xe she said
xe ci am trying to get to that place on my own where let students feel the weight of their decisions xe she said
aylon samouha consultant who led the team that developed the greenfield model said the team came to believe that achievement first students were not sufficiently engaged in school the expeditions also borrowed from summit are intended to spark passions and inspire long term ambitions
each expedition xe there are three year xe is two weeks long for three hours day students in third grade and up get some choice in which ones they pursue all the expeditions are intended to be hands on with two full day field trips last year elm city college prep offered among others debate focused course taught by former teacher at the network who had gone on to law school course on building and architecture and xe cmini med school xe
other aspects of the school model are designed to cultivate students xe sense of identity mr samouha said that the research team believed that just as xe cstereotype threat xe xe or the fear of being negatively stereotyped xe can lead to academic underperformance feeling strong sense of identity and that they are understood could lead students to perform better
twice week students participate in what the network calls xe ccircles xe xe structure borrowed from the social emotional curriculum of another charter network valor collegiate academies in nashville
at aspire middle school circle of fifth grade girls started with the teacher leading the students in taking several deep breaths then the students went around the circle and each said how they were feeling that day in terms of an emoji after the teacher followed up with two girls who said they had felt mad or sad to ask what was going on another girl stood in the middle of the circle and read short assignment she had written about herself xe whom she lived with what activities she enjoyed then other students jumped into the middle of the circle to share ways in which they related to things she had said
feeling like no one understands you mr samouha said can reinforce student xe sense that they don xe belong or are not good enough the network is betting he said that if students feel they can trust those around them xe cyou can release some of that and free up your working memory to work on the tasks at hand xe
mr samouha said that one of the surprising discoveries in his team xe interviews with alumni who had dropped out of college was that in some cases their parents had actually encouraged them to drop out because they didn xe like seeing them struggle and didn xe know that such difficulties were normal and surmountable he said the greenfield team traced that back to the network having not made the parents full partners in their children xe schooling
so in the greenfield model parent teacher conferences are student led and attended by the members of student xe xe cdream team xe which includes parents or other caregivers as well as other mentors like older siblings pastors coaches or family friends
xe cwe xe re not going to solve this through weekly parent seminar on challenges your child will face in college xe mr samouha said xe cwe xe re going to solve it by literally building an experience where parents are at the table with teachers and students xe
so far there is little data to suggest whether the new model is working or not xe test scores at the new haven greenfield school have been mixed
still the network feels confident enough about the model that it is planning to open one or two more greenfield schools in new york next year the network xe ultimate goal is to raise its college completion rate to percent and it says among its more recent classes about half of graduates are on track to finish college
xe cwe xe re data based people xe ms toll said xe cbut to certain extent we just had to say that just because we can xe measure it doesn xe mean we don xe care about it xe of her own assessment she added firmly xe ci think it xe better xe

alongside the excitement and hype about our growing reliance on artificial intelligence there xe fear about the way the technology works recent mit technology review article titled xe cthe dark secret at the heart of ai xe warned xe cno one really knows how the most advanced algorithms do what they do that could be problem xe thanks to this uncertainty and lack of accountability report by the ai now institute recommended that public agencies responsible for criminal justice health care welfare and education shouldn xe use such technology
given these types of concerns the unseeable space between where data goes in and answers come out is often referred to as xe cblack box xe xe seemingly reference to the hardy and in fact orange not black data recorders mandated on aircraft and often examined after accidents in the context of the term more broadly suggests an image of being in the xe cdark xe about how the technology works we put in and provide the data and models and architectures and then computers provide us answers while continuing to learn on their own in way that xe seemingly impossible xe and certainly too complicated xe for us to understand
there xe particular concern about this in health care where is used to classify which skin lesions are cancerous to identify very early stage cancer from blood to predict heart disease to determine what compounds in people and animals could extend healthy life spans and more but these fears about the implications of black box are misplaced is no less transparent than the way in which doctors have always worked xe and in many cases it represents an improvement augmenting what hospitals can do for patients and the entire health care system after all the black box in isn xe new problem due to new tech human intelligence itself is xe and always has been xe black box
let xe take the example of human doctor making diagnosis afterward patient might ask that doctor how she made that diagnosis and she would probably share some of the data she used to draw her conclusion but could she really explain how and why she made that decision what specific data from what studies she drew on what observations from her training or mentors influenced her what tacit knowledge she gleaned from her own and her colleagues xe shared experiences and how all of this combined into that precise insight sure she xe probably give few indicators about what pointed her in certain direction xe but there would also be an element of guessing of following hunches and even if there weren xe we still wouldn xe know that there weren xe other factors involved of which she wasn xe even consciously aware
if the same diagnosis had been made with we could draw from all available information on that particular patient xe as well as data anonymously aggregated across time and from countless other relevant patients everywhere to make the strongest evidence based decision possible it would be diagnosis with direct connection to the data rather than human intuition based on limited data and derivative summaries of anecdotal experiences with relatively small number of local patients
but we make decisions in areas that we don xe fully understand every day xe often very successfully xe from the predicted economic impacts of policies to weather forecasts to the ways in which we approach much of science in the first place we either oversimplify things or accept that they xe re too complex for us to break down linearly let alone explain fully it xe just like the black box of human intelligence can reason and make arguments for given conclusion but it can xe explain the complex underlying basis for how we arrived at particular conclusion think of what happens when couple get divorced because of one stated cause xe say infidelity xe when in reality there xe an entire unseen universe of intertwined causes forces and events that contributed to that outcome why did they choose to split up when another couple in similar situation didn xe even those in the relationship can xe fully explain it it xe black box
the irony is that compared with human intelligence is actually the more transparent of intelligences unlike the human mind can xe and should xe be interrogated and interpreted like the ability to audit and refine models and expose knowledge gaps in deep neural nets and the debugging tools that will inevitably be built and the potential ability to augment human intelligence via brain computer interfaces there are many technologies that could help interpret artificial intelligence in way we can xe interpret the human brain in the process we may even learn more about how human intelligence itself works
perhaps the real source of critics xe concerns isn xe that we can xe xe csee xe xe reasoning but that as gets more powerful the human mind becomes the limiting factor it xe that in the future we xe ll need to understand in health care as well as in other fields this means we will soon see the creation of category of human professionals who don xe have to make the moment to moment decisions themselves but instead manage team of workers xe just like commercial airplane pilots who engage autopilots to land in poor weather conditions doctors will no longer xe cdrive xe the primary diagnosis instead they xe ll ensure that the diagnosis is relevant and meaningful for patient and oversee when and how to offer more clarification and more narrative explanation the doctor xe office of the future will very likely include computer assistants on both the doctor xe side and the patient xe side as well as data inputs that come from far beyond the office walls
when that happens it will become clear that the so called black box of artificial intelligence is more of feature not bug xe because it xe more possible to capture and explain what xe going on there than it is in the human mind none of this dismisses or ignores the need for oversight of it xe just that instead of worrying about the black box we should focus on the opportunity and therefore better address future where not only augments human intelligence and intuition but also perhaps even sheds light on and redefines what it means to be human in the first place

each week kevin roose technology columnist at the new york times discusses developments in the tech industry offering analysis and maybe joke or two want this newsletter in your inbox sign up here
hello xe writing to you from los angeles where the weather is sunny and the electric scooters are venture backed
spent most of the week at the code conference where the tech world xe elite gathered to discuss the current state of the tech industry it was fascinating event less in the sense of newsy product announcements which there weren xe many of and more in the general finger in the wind sense of how the tech industry is thinking about itself
notable at this year xe code was that there seems to be growing rift between the largest tech companies xe apple amazon google facebook and microsoft xe and the rest of the industry
the shadow of the big tech companies loomed large over the conference even if their presence was minimal no executives from apple amazon or google spoke at code and when executives from microsoft and facebook did take the stage they mostly talked about the past brad smith microsoft xe president offered some historical perspective on the company xe antitrust woes from the late sheryl sandberg and mike schroepfer from facebook did yet another rote recitation of the company xe post cambridge analytica xe cwe xe ll do better xe script
instead much of the stage time went to leaders of companies just outside the tech list xe large popular companies that in any other era would be considered enormous success stories but that have spent years locked in fight for survival against their bigger more entrenched rivals
from the perspective of the tech list there are two huge fights to be won first you need to establish foothold in market either by out innovating old line incumbents xe taxis hotels music labels xe or by creating new market altogether then once you xe re established and growing bigger worry emerges what if one of the big five squashes you
good example of tech lister is spotify which appears to be winning its battle with its biggest suppliers xe the three labels that provide the vast majority of spotify xe music xe but lives in perpetual danger of being steamrollered by tech giant onstage at code spotify xe chief executive daniel ek fielded several questions about whether he worried about competitors like apple amazon and google all of which have their own music streaming services and more important control the hardware platforms ios android alexa on which people consume music
mr ek mostly deflected saying that there are xe cvery very few opportunities that billion plus people around the world care about xe and that the giants xe interest in music streaming showed the attractiveness of the category
but of course he xe worried the message of the past several years is clear no matter how big and successful you are as consumer facing media communications or advertising company you xe ll eventually end up in the same boat butting up against the shore of the island where google amazon apple microsoft and facebook have constructed their impregnable fortresses side note if you like reading about those five companies you xe ll probably be glad that my colleague farhad manjoo who is writing an entire book on them is returning from book leave next week
evan spiegel snap xe chief executive sounded similar note at the conference when asked about facebook xe habit of blatantly copying snapchat xe most distinctive product features mr spiegel xe sassy comeback xe xe cwe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also xe xe was the best line there
but perhaps the clearest articulation of the tech list worldview came from randall stephenson the chief executive of at amp mr stephenson has been fighting to acquire time warner since november in an attempt to cobble together some combination of content libraries mobile networks and advertising tech that is big enough to survive battle with the googles and amazons of the world
asked by recode xe peter kafka how he thought about this battle mr stephenson using an acronym for facebook apple netflix and google answered
xe cwell believe if you don xe create pure vertical integrated capability vertically integrated capability xe from distribution all the way through content creation and advertising models xe you xe re going to have hard time competing with these guys and the statistic we throw out and since we announced this deal in november of the fang market caps have gone up over trillion you better figure out how to vertically integrate here if you want to compete with those players xe
it xe not unusual to see small firms complaining about the difficulty of breaking into established markets it xe more unusual to see those complaints coming from the leader of billion telecom giant and it shows just how dominant the tech list has become and how difficult overcoming its concentration of market power is proving to be
here are few other tech stories of note this past week
xe xa my colleagues scott shane cade metz and daisuke wakabayashi had great story about how google xe involvement in pentagon artificial intelligence project has sparked an xe cexistential crisis xe at the company with leaders disagreeing about how and whether to allow google xe machine learning technology to serve military interests watch this space xe the debate over project maven at google is one of the first of what suspect will be many employee led revolts over ethics and corporate behavior at the largest tech firms
xe xa my colleague nathaniel popper wrote about the chaos unfolding at envion swiss cryptocurrency company that raised million in an initial coin offering this year and is now in nathaniel xe words xe cmelting down with the people who created it accusing one another of fraud xe for one am shocked
xe xa the softbank vision fund silicon valley xe rich uncle is taking its giant bags of money on the road general motors announced on thursday that softbank was making billion investment in its cruise self driving car division in exchange for an eventual percent stake in the unit after its vehicles are commercially ready that xe pretty nice validation for which bought cruise for nearly billion just two years ago and further sign that softbank is willing to keep spending money like an instagram scammer in pursuit of the next big thing
xe xa enjoyed taylor lorenz xe piece in the atlantic about the struggling meme economy where the shortening life cycle of memes has made it harder for merchandise hawkers on sites like dankmememerch com and xe cdank tank xe to sell their tide pod socks and yanny vs laurel shirts softbank vision fund only you can invest in these struggling businesses and save the meme industry from ruin

good morning

so far the opioid crisis hasn xe hit california as badly as many eastern and midwestern states but with deadly synthetic fentanyl spreading there highland hospital in oakland is trying new way of getting addicted patients into treatment those who come to its emergency room in withdrawal or with another medical problem are offered an initial dose of buprenorphine medication that staves off withdrawal symptoms and cravings
substantial body of research has found that people who take buprenorphine are less likely to die and more likely to stay in treatment
highland is trying to plug gaping hole in medical system that typically fails to provide treatment on demand or any evidence based treatment at all even as more than two million americans suffer from opioid addiction according to the latest estimates overdoses involving opioids killed nearly people last year
dr andrew herring an emergency medicine doctor at highland persuaded the california health care foundation to give small grant last year to highland and seven other hospitals in northern california to experiment with dispensing buprenorphine in their emergency rooms now the state is spending nearly more to expand the concept it xe part of broader million effort to set up xe chub and spoke xe system meant to expand access to buprenorphine and two other addiction medications methadone and naltrexone
under that system emergency rooms would serve as portals of entry getting people started on buprenorphine and referring them to hub or large scale addiction treatment clinic to get adjusted to the medication and spoke or primary care practice for ongoing care dr herring is the principal investigator for the project known as bridge
few dozen other hospital emergency departments around the country including at zuckerberg san francisco general hospital have also started offering buprenorphine meanwhile california xe bridge is joining forces with project shout which offers buprenorphine and methadone to people who have been hospitalized with complications from opioid addiction

the car of the future will have powerful communication technology on board
as self driving cars pull onto the nation xe roads these advanced abilities will help manage the traffic mix of tomorrow but they may also change the way we communicate while on the go automakers are betting that if our cars have the technological muscle to keep us connected we will park our phones when we get in and communicate from the dashboard
side benefit of all this technology is that it will also usher in range of conveniences these may include offering drivers options for fuel food and lodging perhaps with bit of hard sell thrown in for owners of some general motors vehicles taste of this future is already here
since december has equipped about three million cars with an in dash system it calls marketplace the free to use system communicates directly with merchants enabling driver or passengers to order and pay for variety of products and services without cellphone
vendors include mcdonald xe shell exxon mobil dunkin xe donuts applebee xe delivery com ihop parkopedia priceline wingstop tgi fridays office depot and yelp for restaurant reservations
many owners of cars equipped with marketplace probably don xe even know it xe available only about people have signed on and it xe not mentioned in any car manuals wanted to allow time for refinement and for lining up more merchants but is now starting to promote the system to consumers
marketplace interacts with xe infotainment system and establishes dialogue with the car owner for example if the car is running low on fuel marketplace can provide directions to the nearest gas station the system allows drivers to sign up for the vendor xe reward program and can point the way to discounted gas there is no need to swipe credit card at the pump because marketplace handles the transaction and turns on the pump
marketplace communicates by means of glt modem that can connect to cellular network or wi fi was well situated to adopt this technology because its vehicles have been equipped with modems since onstar xe debut in
other carmakers have introduced modem based communication systems but has made the most comprehensive push into mobile communication and marketing
rick ruskin general motors executive leading the connected customer experience also points out focus on limiting distracted driving
xe cmarketplace allows drivers to do in their car what they might previously have done on their phone xe he said xe cit xe much safer than phone in one hand and the steering wheel in the other xe
automakers have long employed the driver xe cellphone and bluetooth connection as the underlying technology for convenience features but more companies and analysts view this as an inelegant and limited solution
built in modem with its own sim card will eventually become the only way new cars communicate with one another the infrastructure the owner xe devices and mobile vendors said david liniado vice president for new growth and technology at the cox automotive research firm
sim cards which carry an identification number unique to the owner are now in million vehicles globally mr liniado said xe cbluetooth and the phone are gone xe he added
the driver or front seat passenger can interact with marketplace by touching the dashboard screen voice command technology is in development stefan cross spokesman said
actions that require considerable involvement and could distract driver such as booking hotel room on priceline can be executed only when the vehicle is stopped
marketplace also limits options for example starbucks customer can order from the car while it is being driven but only few choices based on previous orders will be displayed and the format is standardized so drivers know where to look and what to do no matter which vendor xe page they open helping them remain focused on the road
marketplace vendors either pay an upfront fee to be included or give share of sales it xe not huge revenue stream but it xe better than no revenue
on web page aimed at merchants that hope to sell directly to drivers the automaker writes xe cmarketplace is the spark to ignite shift in how consumers are immersed into vehicle experiences with first of its kind branded ecosystem marketplace enables businesses to seamlessly integrate into drivers xe daily lives xe
other automakers are taking advantage of in car communication on smaller scale bmw connected now allows vehicle owners to speak to alexa from the car using the car xe onboard modem no smartphone required the automaker has not added vendors to its system but car owners can ask alexa to place orders
land rover xe touch pro duo system communicates via an in car modem and can find filling stations and provide traffic information mercedes benz offers system called mercedes me an app that provides control functions is installed on cellphone or other personal device and the car communicates with the owner via the vehicle xe onboard modem the system enables the creation of xe cgeofence xe boundaries if the automobile is driven beyond boundary it sends message to the car owner
audi has added feature called traffic light information which xe ctalks xe to stoplights and can tell drivers how long they will have to wait before the light changes to green it works only in the few cities including las vegas phoenix and washington that have installed the necessary hardware
while automakers and industry consultants are thinking about how in car communication will work others like bryan reimer research scientist at the massachusetts institute of technology are thinking about ways to ensure that these features won xe introduce new hazards
xe cin providing information to the driver we have to thread it strategically drivers must have ample time to look at the road xe dr reimer said xe cthey can xe look off the road even briefly if they haven xe looked at the road long enough to see what xe going on xe
dr reimer said engineers were devising systems that can determine how often and how long the driver is looking at the road and issue alerts and warnings if the driver xe attention wanders
asked if there were any regulations on what driver should be doing in the vehicle dr reimer said the national highway traffic safety administration xe chas developed distraction guidelines regarding vehicle activities in general but they don xe specify what type of in vehicle applications should be allowed xe
he added xe cthe automotive alliance has also provided guidelines that manufacturers have pledged to follow with regard to driver distraction one has to ask is it really appropriate to shop in car as vehicles automate more it is plausible that what is acceptable should change but we haven xe really come to grips with what is appropriate to do on either smartphone or using an in car application while driving xe
all things considered it seems certain that new car buyers will soon be in touch with almost everything while on the fly and that this ability will undoubtedly expand by default the car will be part of the internet of things
for those driving older vehicles some retrofitting will be possible verizon offers modem device and feature set called hum that is similar to what is built into new cars and plugs into the onboard diagnostics port of most vehicles from and later and mercedes benz dealers in britain are retrofitting communication ability in many cars built since

half moon bay calif xe mark zuckerberg xe xe cmove fast and break things xe mantra may no longer be facebook xe modus operandi but silicon valley xe demand for rapid growth is still strong and the rise of the competitive landscape of artificial intelligence is only fueling it
last year venture capital investment in start ups increased percent from the previous year to record billion in the united states according to pricewaterhousecoopers report
reid hoffman the co founder of linkedin and partner at greylock partners said at the new york times xe new work summit in california that he looked very carefully at ventures to see how they were making new interesting things possible and how he could bet on them early he said current machine learning techniques which are transforming fundamental industries gave an amazing glimpse of the future
xe cmy ideal investing is stuff that looks little crazy now and in three years is obvious or five years is obvious xe mr hoffman said
he voiced some concerns around how could transform the global landscape likening it to the shift from the agricultural age to the industrial age
xe cyou xe ll see enormous changes from where the bulk of people find jobs and employment xe he said xe cthe first worry is what does that transition look like that intervening transition is super painful xe
and how ethically the technology will be developed will tie into who wins the race to build it some groups will care about human impact others will not he said
mr hoffman recently released the book xe cblitzscaling the lightning fast path to building massively valuable companies xe which details his theory that the rapid growth of company xe above almost all else xe is what leads to its success
and this attitude he said is why silicon valley continues to produce impressive tech companies
xe ceverywhere in the world recognizes that technology is super important there xe super great talent everywhere xe mr hoffman said
xe cit xe this understanding of the network of learning and this playbook of the first to scale is what wins the competitive race xe
recent report from kpmg noted there was record billion of venture capital invested around the world in up from about billion the previous year
jeffrey rayport senior lecturer at harvard business school who teaches an course on scaling tech ventures said founders were often at the mercy of intense demands and the xe cfinancing treadmill xe from venture capitalists xe funding model that some silicon valley founders are starting to reject
xe cthe world has become very sophisticated about how to scale technology ventures and with that sophistication has come in sense very professional and very aggressive set of investors xe mr rayport said
xe cthe flip side of that is that once you put venture on path of successive financing rounds that are betting on exponential growth then the pressure is enormous to deliver whether or not it makes sense for the venture xe
young founders who xe ccan xe scale into the opportunity they created xe are common occurrence xe cthey xe ve got to figure out how to do years of learning and development as leaders as managers as people in space of maybe two years xe mr rayport said

mr cohen is the author of xe cthe know it alls the rise of silicon valley as political powerhouse and social wrecking ball xe
that the questioning of mark zuckerberg on tuesday by two full senate committees was considered triumph for mr zuckerberg xe he made billion personally as facebook stock shot up during his testimony xe shouldn xe come as surprise this was an unfair fight between man who knew intimately the project being debated and lot of people who didn xe
the occasion for his senate hearing and his appearance in the house on wednesday was data breach that allowed british political consulting firm working for the trump campaign to gain access to million facebook profiles but as the questioning unfolded mr zuckerberg behaved as if he were the only competent one in the room
when senator richard blumenthal democrat of connecticut asked xe cwould you agree that users should be able to access all of their information xe mr zuckerberg seemed confused xe csenator we have already xe download your information xe tool that allows people to see and to take out all of the information that facebook xe that they xe ve put into facebook or that facebook knows about them so yes agree with that we already have that xe
similarly when senator john kennedy republican of louisiana asked xe care you going to go back to work on giving me greater right to erase my data xe mr zuckerberg again appeared perplexed saying xe csenator you can already delete all the data that xe there xe
this wasn xe quite the contemptuous jimmy fallon character xe nick burns your company xe computer guy xe who briefly tries to explain the problem before shouting xe cmove xe and fixing it himself but then again mr zuckerberg had the benefit of intensive politeness training
mr zuckerberg has been winning these unfair fights going on years now the idea that he xe the computer guy and we are the helpless office workers in his way exemplifies the attitude of facebook and silicon valley more broadly
famously facebook itself is the residue of an early unfair fight back in mr zuckerberg was hired by three compatriots from harvard xe cameron and tyler winklevoss and their friend divya narendra xe to write code for their social network connectu mr zuckerberg soon dropped the task only to reappear couple of months later on feb with social network site called thefacebook com
the allegation that mr zuckerberg stole the idea was fought in court and ended in settlement that netted the winklevosses and mr narenda cash and company stock worth tens of millions of dollars mr zuckerberg plowed ahead under new paradigm later defined by matt welsh mr zuckerberg xe computer science professor at harvard as xe cnerds win xe
xe cideas are cheap and don xe mean squat if you don xe know how to execute on them xe mr welsh explained in on his blog in response to the nasty portrait of mr zuckerberg in the movie xe cthe social network xe xe cto have an impact you need both the vision and the technical chops as well as the tenacity to make something real mark was able to do all of those things and think he deserves every bit of success that comes his way xe
in the past mr zuckerberg xe talents could only be tool for richer and better connected peers like the winklevosses who would provide the money and define the purpose of the project by the mid however mr zuckerberg could turn the tables
xe cthe fact that we could sort of rent machines for you know like month and use that to scale up to point where we had users is pretty cool and it xe pretty unique thing that xe going on in technology right now xe mr zuckerberg told harvard computer science students when he came back to campus in as year old entrepreneur
at the time of the talk mr zuckerberg estimated that google had million page views day with thousands of machines and employees while facebook had significantly more page views million hundreds of machines and just barely employees
by then larry page and sergey brin had already given up control of google as the price for venture capital to keep the project running agreeing to an outside chief executive as investors had insisted to this day mr zuckerberg retains majority control over facebook and remains its chief executive xe his decisions about regulation privacy and transparency can mean happiness or misery for the more than two billion citizens of facebook nation xe majestic powers that are enshrined when you check the right box on the terms of service agreement
peter thiel the first outside investor in facebook and longtime adviser to mr zuckerberg sees founder led tech start up as something like an independent cell that can help drive social change xe ca start up xe he writes in his book xe czero to one xe xe cis the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery you can have agency not just over your own life but over small and important part of the world xe
in these extraordinary times we are learning how society changes when it is in the hands of power drunk engineers products and services are delivered much more reliably and efficiently we are able to communicate quickly directly widely but there are serious problems too and they are far more serious than even critics realized at first
to start these silicon valley titans are in denial about history they pride themselves on not bending to what has come before is there racism and sexism in the united states didn xe happen on my watch computers don xe see sex or color when pressed by the few senators of color about facebook xe complicity in running real estate ads aimed exclusively at white people which would violate the fair housing act mr zuckerberg defined this as particularly compelling challenge for artificial intelligence software
ads can no longer be explicitly targeted to racial groups he said though of course the rub is that there are plenty of surrogates for race that advertisers can presumably still use this led to the absurd observation from mr zuckerberg in response to question from senator mazie hirono democrat of hawaii that xe cmost of the enforcement today is still that our community flags issues for us when that comes up xe how the community can identify when real estate ad is appearing only to white people remains mystery
notably there was no declaration from mr zuckerberg about the pain of racial inequality nor an apology for facebook xe role in perpetuating it to senator cory booker democrat of new jersey he simply said xe ci xe not happy with where we are xe there is an unhealthy detachment xe virtualness xe to the destruction caused by silicon valley innovations one can xe help thinking that the ability to reset or reboot computer has infiltrated companies xe calculations about the cost of disruption and destruction
despite the length of mr zuckerberg xe senate appearance there was no serious reckoning with what happened in the election instead there was an insistent focus on the future which for mr zuckerberg was synonymous with one phrase xe ca xe in five to years he promised artificial intelligence will clean up the mess that is facebook in
the problems with facebook emerge from its lack of human touch but mr zuckerberg doubles down on software on wednesday representative david mckinley west virginia republican displayed recent facebook ads offering opioids for sale without prescription and addressed mr zuckerberg directly xe cfacebook is actually enabling an illegal activity and in so doing you are hurting people xe he said xe cwould you agree with that statement xe mr zuckerberg xe response was to concede things were bad but to hold out the promise of the future xe cwe need to build more tools that can proactively find that content xe he said
as long as the discussion was about software xe how it works how it can be improved how users interact with it xe mr zuckerberg holds the upper hand when the discussion is about values he is as confused as the rest of us and takes refuge in the belief that society is nothing more than series of market based online interactions as captured absorbed and understood by engineers
government regulation in this scheme is product of corrupt inefficient political system self regulation on the other hand is product of people voting with their actions and brilliant engineers devising solutions to meet their needs smug interpretation that mr zuckerberg outwitted dopey legislators only plays into the silicon valley view that being called before congress to answer questions is bug of our democracy instead of vital feature

the self driving uber was traveling north at about
the car volvo xc sport utility vehicle outfitted with sensor system was in autonomous mode when it struck elaine herzberg around on sunday there was human safety driver at the wheel but the car was carrying no passengers
the vehicle was going about miles an hour on street with mile an hour speed limit when it struck ms herzberg who was walking her bicycle across the street according to the tempe police
authorities on wednesday released portions of dashboard camera recording from the vehicle which showed the exterior and interior of the car moments before the accident warning the video contains graphic material
the video shows that the safety driver identified by police as rafael vasquez was clearly distracted and looking down from the road
it also appears that both of the safety driver hands were not hovering above the steering wheel which is what most backup drivers are instructed to do because it allows them to take control of the car quickly in the case of an emergency
earlier in the week police officials said the driver was not impaired and had cooperated with authorities the self driving car however should have detected the woman crossing the road
like many self driving cars uber equips its vehicles with lidar sensors an acronym for light detection and ranging systems to help the car detect the world around it one of the positive attributes of lidar is that it is supposed to work well at night when it is dark detecting objects from hundreds of feet away
the accident was reminder that self driving technology is still in the experimental stage as silicon valley giants major automakers and other companies race to develop vehicles that can drive on their own governments for their part are still trying to figure out how to regulate the technology and patchwork of rules are in place around the country
uber xe self driving program first started in pittsburgh in september and extended to tempe in february the arizona city was considered an ideal place to test autonomous vehicles because of its favorable weather and wide roads
after sunday xe crash uber quickly suspended the program in arizona as well as in pittsburgh san francisco and toronto
xe cthe video is disturbing and heartbreaking to watch and our thoughts continue to be with elaine xe loved ones xe matt kallman spokesman for uber said wednesday xe cour cars remain grounded and we re assisting local state and federal authorities in any way we can xe
the tempe police said it was still investigating the crash
ms herzberg xe death was not the first involving self driving technology
in man in florida was killed while at the wheel of tesla while using its autopilot feature which uses computer vision based vehicle detection system that differs from the technology used by uber federal investigators later ruled that the system was not at fault in the crash

london xe uber won an appeal on tuesday to regain its taxi license in london after agreeing to stricter government oversight crucial victory for efforts by its new chief executive to revamp the company xe grow at all costs culture
the closely watched case could serve as template for other cities looking to extract concessions from uber the ride hailing service that has upended the taxi industry worldwide often by ignoring the concerns of regulators the company suffered major setback with that approach last fall when the transport authorities in london xe its most lucrative european market xe withdrew its license it has been able to continue to operate through the appeals process
the court case has been test for the conciliatory approach toward regulators taken by dara khosrowshahi uber xe chief executive mr khosrowshahi replaced the famously combative travis kalanick last year and he has made it priority to show officials throughout the world that the san francisco based uber can comply with local rules
on tuesday judge at westminster magistrates xe court in london bolstered mr khosrowshahi xe campaign reissuing uber xe license albeit for months xe less than the five years that is typical for taxi licenses uber had agreed to install new leadership in london adopt rules to report incidents to the police keep tired drivers off the road and share traffic data with the city the company also named new independent board to oversee british operations
in reading statement the judge emma arbuthnot laid blame for uber xe misdeeds at the feet of former managers who had xe cgung ho attitude xe to xe cgrow the business come what may xe
judge arbuthnot added that the month license required uber to prove its cultural changes were lasting xe cthe question xe she said xe cis whether uber can be trusted xe
the mayor of london sadiq khan whose office oversees transportation in the capital declared victory in statement along with the relatively short license uber was ordered to pay court costs for london xe transport authorities
xe cuber has been forced to overhaul the way it operates not just in london but across the world including completely changing its global governance structures and implementing new systems for reporting alleged crimes xe mr khan said
tom elvidge uber xe general manager in britain said in his own statement that the company was xe cpleased with today xe decision xe and would work with city officials to xe caddress their concerns and earn their trust xe
with more than million people who use the service at least once every three months london is one of uber xe most lucrative global markets and biggest success stories outside the united states the appeal removes black eye as mr khosrowshahi scales back in asia and prepares for an initial public offering as early as next year
but the company xe size also makes it politically risky for government officials to take its cars off the road uber says it provides millions of rides per week in london and with roughly drivers its fleet nearly doubles the number of black cabs more than people signed petition supporting uber after the ban was announced last year
steve mcnamara general secretary of the licensed taxi drivers xe association which represents about half the city xe cabbies criticized the city for allowing uber to become xe ctoo big to fail xe the union lobbied to prevent uber from regaining license and some of its members were in the audience during the hearings
uber xe experience in london tracks closely with its experience in other major cities it gained popularity among customers who enjoyed the app xe convenience and comparatively low prices and uber xe strategy was to grow as quickly as possible so that it became indispensable
but with its growth came criticism over poor treatment of drivers inadequate passenger safety and harm to incumbent taxi industries in september frustrated by raft of global scandals london revoked uber xe license transport for london which regulates ride hailing services in the city said uber was not xe cfit and proper xe business designation required to operate in britain
xe cwe xe ve had five years of very difficult relationship where uber has felt it didn xe require regulation xe helen chapman transport for london xe director of licensing regulation and charging said during testimony on tuesday
the initial decision to revoke uber xe license focused attention on the fast changing dynamics of london xe taxi industry drivers of the british capital xe iconic black cabs are predominantly white and have to pass an exacting exam known as the knowledge by memorizing thousands of city streets over the course of several years uber drivers by contrast are mostly immigrants and are quickly able to sign up and navigate london xe streets with the help of smartphones and gps software
the two day trial in london allowed regulators to make their case uber managers were questioned about the use of software to avoid government oversight the software called greyball was developed in part to aid entrance into markets where the company xe service was not permitted the tool allowed uber to deploy what was essentially fake version of its app to duck law enforcement agencies that were cracking down on its service
the managers were upbraided over instances in which sexual assault allegations against drivers were not reported to the police and they were criticized for data breach that exposed millions of customers but that was not reported to the authorities for months
in each instance company representatives accepted blame and outlined the changes made under mr khosrowshahi to address those issues
mr elvidge said regulators had been right to revoke the company xe license given its past behavior over several hours of testimony on monday he called decisions made by the previous leadership team xe centirely regrettable xe xe ca bad idea xe xe cnot appropriate xe and xe cfundamentally wrong xe
xe cit was really clear that the corporate culture of the previous leadership had to change xe mr elvidge told the court
testimony during the trial described an unrestrained company culture where leaders in san francisco made decisions that managers in london had to explain to regulators when data breach was reported last year mr elvidge said he learned about it from news reports he first told british regulators that only one driver had been exposed but several hours later shared that in fact information from million people in britain had been taken
uber said it had created new rules for reporting problems to regulators including an unusual policy to notify government officials when the company is aware of potentially negative news coverage
to address safety concerns the company also worked with london xe metropolitan police to create policy for reporting possible crimes by drivers in the past uber left the decision about reporting wrongdoing to customers the company also said it would be more aggressive about barring drivers when riders complain
london is not the only area where uber has made changes under mr khosrowshahi the company has settled protracted legal battle with waymo owned by the google parent alphabet over self driving car technology it has offered drivers new insurance protections in some markets and it proposed fee on ride hailing services to pay for xe chardship fund xe for struggling taxi drivers in new york where mayor bill de blasio and the city council are under pressure to adopt stricter policies against ride hailing services
laurel powers freeling appointed last year as chairwoman of uber xe independent board in britain testified that uber was seeing major cultural changes
xe ci xe ve seen real will to take on new set of values xe she said

president trump signed an executive order monday meant to spur the development and regulation of artificial intelligence technology that many experts believe will define the future of everything from consumer products to health care to warfare
experts across industry academia and government have long called on the trump administration to make the development of artificial intelligence major priority last spring worried that the united states was not keeping pace with china and other countries jim mattis then the defense secretary sent memo to the white house imploring the president to create national strategy on
now mr trump has taken that step though this xe camerican initiative xe might not be as bold as some had hoped
the executive order aimed to better educate workers in the field improve access to the cloud computing services and data needed to build systems and promote cooperation with foreign powers but the order did not set aside funds for research and development and the administration provided few details on how it planned put its new policies into effect
the united states is engaged in an increasingly bitter trade war with china and while american companies like google and amazon are now leaders in experts in the field are concerned that china could surpass the united states in the development of technologies that will power surveillance systems and autonomous weapons as well as driverless cars and wide range of internet services
in july chinese unveiled plan to become the world leader in aiming to create an industry worth billion to its economy by and two chinese cities promised to invest billion in the effort other governments too began making large investments including south korea britain france and canada
in the united states the defense department has accelerated efforts to embrace shifting million of its annual budget to new office that will develop these technologies other government agencies also have major projects in the works but many experts have worried that the top talent in the united states is moving to companies like google and amazon and away from government agencies
last year these concerns increased when google pulled out of project to build for the pentagon after employees protested that the technology they were working on could be used for lethal purposes companies like google are also expanding their operations in countries like china france and canada as the talent in those countries continues to expand
in briefing with reporters on sunday senior administration official said the white house would increase efforts to educate american workers in the field the administration plans to work with the national council for the american worker to create educational efforts through industry and academia and it will call on government agencies to develop fellowships related to
the official did not provide specifics on how the united states will track the progress of these efforts

san francisco xe google xe parent company alphabet had tumultuous with employee revolts antitrust fines tough privacy regulation in europe and heightened political scrutiny in washington
through it all the company managed to produce strong financial results with the numbing consistency of the new england patriots in the super bowl
on monday alphabet said revenue rose percent to billion in its most recent quarter while profits swung to billion last year alphabet reported loss after it took billion charge for the repatriation of foreign earnings after changes in the tax code
alphabet xe financial consistency is easily explained google owns the internet xe ultimate beachfront property the starting point for lot of internet activity whether it xe someone looking for entertainment on youtube or hunting for product information on the google search engine
while facebook and amazon are formidable competitors google is the top destination for marketers looking to reach consumers online it accounted for percent of digital advertising around the world last year according to the research firm emarketer
google said advertising revenue from xe cgoogle properties xe like search and youtube was billion in the fourth quarter up percent from year earlier
the company xe ad business is shifting as more consumers use mobile devices for access to the internet alphabet reported percent increase in clicks on its ads although the revenue per click fell percent during the quarter in other words people are looking at google xe ads more often though the price of those ads is dropping
mobile ads cost less than ads viewed on desktop devices but the company has offset that decline because search ads take up more screen space on mobile phones xe making it more likely users will click on them
alphabet xe quarterly results beat wall street xe estimates but the company xe share price was down about percent in after hours trading on monday
if there is cause for concern it is google xe rising costs in order to maintain foothold on smartphones google pays smartphone manufacturers like apple billions of dollars to be the default search engine on their devices
alphabet is also spending more to acquire content for youtube market new hardware products and build new data centers and other sorts of technology infrastructure
on conference call with analysts on monday sundar pichai google xe chief executive said investments in building and expanding data centers were xe can important long term investment xe for future computing needs as the company rolled out new technologies like artificial intelligence
in google xe costs and expenses grew percent outpacing the percent increase in revenue the company xe capital expenditures nearly doubled in the past year to billion
alphabet has continued to hire aggressively it had employees as of dec compared with workers year earlier
ruth porat alphabet xe chief financial officer has pushed the company to be more mindful of its costs xe calling for more fiscal discipline at units like google xe research and development arm but her cost cutting push has raised concerns among google xe vocal employees
last week google had to address spreadsheet created by its human resources department in xe the year after ms porat joined the company xe that raised the possibility of cost cutting measures like promoting fewer employees and scaling back some of the company xe famous workplace perks
at weekly employee meeting google management responded to sharp criticism from employees about the spreadsheet saying that it was brainstorming exercise and that most of the proposals were never considered

this year marks the th anniversary of the first publication of mary shelley xe frankenstein the story of human like creature brought to life through technology uncontrollable and bent on our destruction still haunts us frankenstein xe legacy lives on through contemporary science fiction xe the terminator series westworld and even altered carbon all owe it significant debt the idea of human like technology and its unintended consequences lurks within public debate and subtly and not so subtly shapes cultural responses to new and emergent technologies
nowhere is this more evident than in current conversations about artificial intelligence ai after all ai can feel lot like frankenstein xe monster xe potentially powerful technical force that can do what humans do raising the question of whether and how we might keep it under control
much to the disappointment of the computer scientists and engineers with whom spend my time don xe think there is an easy answer which is why we need to have the conversation ai is everywhere
there is great deal of hype surrounding ai and many misunderstandings intel recently sponsored the dealbook conference where business leaders were surveyed on their thoughts on ai below we found that largely leaders are enthusiastic about ai xe possibility to transform industries and they trust it but they are unsure if ai is always being used responsibly and they are on the fence about government xe role and impact of oversight
one of the challenges is that ai isn xe single technology it is constellation of them xe learning techniques algorithms sensing technologies strategic and reasoning even how data sets are collected analyzed and used it isn xe an omnipotent force but disparate set of different kinds of implementations and activities it isn xe magic it is lot of mathematics
ai isn xe just about decisions happening inside computers it is also increasingly about autonomous systems cyber physical systems xe drones self driving cars smart buildings and yes humanoid robots
the impact of ai as it scales is increasingly becoming visible bringing into sharp relief the risks and trade offs from building trust between autonomous vehicles and human beings to bias in criminal sentencing algorithms we are now seeing challenges with automated systems of all kinds perhaps it shouldn xe be so surprising then that we are hearing more and more about the ethics of ai and its various manifestations including data sets and algorithms
ethical context
but what do we mean by xe cethics xe the dictionary defines ethics as xe cmoral principles that govern person behavior or the conducting of an activity xe and morals in turn are defined as the xe cprinciples concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior xe as an anthropologist those definitions serve to remind me that ethics and morals are human artefacts xe after all right and wrong good and bad are not as simple as they sound they are ideas that are cultural contextual contingent and even contested xe they have changed over time and will continue to do so
new technology routinely outpaces society xe ability to manage and think about ethics placing pressure on our systems of judgment and value in the th and thcenturies new technologies led to the exploitation of children and society faced hard conversations about the ethics of children working in mines sweeping chimneys or laboring in factories in vitro fertilization embryonic stem cell research and birth control were th century technologies which stirred us to think deeply about our values xe often without consensus
not only do ethics change over time reflecting new ways of seeing the world and orienting to what matters but frequently they are tacit revealed only when we violate them hard wiring them into technical systems would be very difficult indeed
hard conversations and nuanced answers
so where does that leave us today instead of black and white answers think we need nuanced approach
ethical dilemmas give us the opportunity to have hard conversations they present classic thought exercise in moral philosophy where the debate centers on the choice between two outcomes neither one of which is unambiguously the right thing to do we can use ethical dilemmas to explicitly surface the kinds of decisions new technical systems can and will necessitate and then have the conversations about the outcomes we want and expect these conversations won xe be easy xe conversations about ethics and morals rarely are xe but they are important and necessary
building with an ethical foundation
we could work toward ai with degrees of transparency and trust which means designing architecting and building ai systems that can be easily explained algorithms could effectively unbox themselves for scrutiny and regulation machine learning techniques could show off the steps that were taken in their creation displaying the standards for back tracing and traceability along those lines it would be helpful if systems and their designers know how and when to signal that the systems are in fact technical and not human
these are clearly technical challenges and ones that require dedicated and genuine attention this is about ensuring that things that affect humans if not controlled directed and led can at the very minimum be debated by humans
we could also take step back from the technology per se and direct our efforts within the broader context in which they are built after all ai is made by humans who are governed by laws and rules frequently working inside organizations that are similarly regulated
of course this is complicated whose ideas about good bad fair and unfair will be the ones that we rely upon who gets to decide this who will enforce it and this process can be deflating because these are questions we have been tackling for the whole of human existence but ai is new and different but ultimately ethical ai should start with ethical organizations and ethical human beings
one of my favorite roboticists once asked what would it be like if we imagined that robots embodied our best selves not our worst two hundred years after frankenstein wonder that too
is it finally time we build something new without also always building monster
the future of ai business leader survey
ethics and ai business leaders trust ai but want to know when it xe being used and are unsure if it xe always being used responsibly
percent trust ai most or all of the time percent believe ai must identify itself as not human percent respond xe ci don xe know xe when asked if society government corporations and academia are harnessing ai responsibly the most common response percent believe building ethical and responsible ai systems is the biggest hurdle to ai succeeding in the next five years
future impact business leaders because that robotics and healthcare are the top two use cases where ai will have the broadest effect next
today voice assist recommendation engines and smart homes tomorrow robotics healthcare and surveillance
developing standards and regulations business leaders agree that we must establish rules and standards for ai yet feel government oversight would impede ai xe success
percent agree we must establish nationally or internationally recognized standards for ethical ai percent cite either too much or too little government oversight as the biggest hurdle to ai xe success in the next five years

each week technology reporters and columnists from the new york times review the week xe news offering analysis and maybe joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry want this newsletter in your inbox sign up here
hello readers xe dai wakabayashi technology reporter in san francisco it xe my turn to write this newsletter and as luck would have it my moment in the sun comes on light summer news week
the great thing about the summer is that it xe barbecue season that means lots of casual conversations where break free from my technology and news bubble and gauge whether the things we write about are reaching broader audience
this year more than can remember in the recent past it xe clear how ingrained the tech industry has become in our lives and how people are constantly discussing the ripple effects of its influence and money tech was central to discussions had about local and national politics real estate prices and how to raise children the company that most people wanted to talk about facebook
last weekend while was in seattle facebook was topic with group of non tech folks one told me that she had deleted her facebook account month ago asked if it was because she was upset about the role facebook played in the presidential election it wasn xe really that she said facebook made her feel bad about herself she found herself being person she didn xe like when she was scrolling the news feed and she decided that she could live without it she remains on instagram because she enjoys it
my colleague kevin roose captured this idea early this year xe people may be tiring of facebook but they love instagram
in my limited sample size the complaints about facebook were less about misinformation on the platform or the proliferation of ads they seemed more basic than that relatives writing distasteful posts about politics or acquaintances oversharing about their personal lives for the first time noticed people were making excuses as to why they were even on facebook anymore as though it was an embarrassing vice
facebook xe bad news cycle doesn xe appear to be coming to an end anytime soon despite the mea culpa commercials this week we found out that federal investigation into facebook xe sharing of data with cambridge analytica has broadened to include more agencies including the securities and exchange commission kevin also wrote an interesting article about how the supreme court vacancy is already playing out in facebook ads
xe heading out on vacation soon with the goal of detoxing little from my tech use but before go have to order few last minute items on amazon download kid friendly shows from netflix for my ipad arrange few social outings with friends on facebook messenger and make sure my privacy settings are in order because my family is definitely going to tag me on facebook in vacation photos there is no escape
in other news
xe xa the ride hailing world is really getting into bicycles lyft acquired the core operations of motivate the parent company of citibike and other bike sharing programs in united states cities few months earlier rival uber bought jump bikes motorized bike sharing service
xe xa increasingly tech companies are finding that the harshest critics for their policies are coming not from the outside world but from their own employees in his latest column farhad manjoo examined why the tech activism trend hasn xe caught on at twitter president trump xe favorite soapbox
xe xa he xe baaaaaack anthony levandowski the self driving car engineer who was at the center of the intellectual property lawsuit between waymo and uber appears to be involved with secret self driving truck company according to techcrunch it xe wonder that he had the time to start new company after invoking his fifth amendment rights in that waymo uber kerfuffle starting religion around and being sued by former nanny

washington xe thousands of google employees including dozens of senior engineers have signed letter protesting the company xe involvement in pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence to interpret video imagery and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes
the letter which is circulating inside google and has garnered more than signatures reflects culture clash between silicon valley and the federal government that is likely to intensify as cutting edge artificial intelligence is increasingly employed for military purposes
read the text of the letter
xe cwe believe that google should not be in the business of war xe says the letter addressed to sundar pichai the company xe chief executive it asks that google pull out of project maven pentagon pilot program and announce policy that it will not xe cever build warfare technology xe
that kind of idealistic stance while certainly not shared by all google employees comes naturally to company whose motto is xe cdon xe be evil xe phrase invoked in the protest letter but it is distinctly foreign to washington xe massive defense industry and certainly to the pentagon where the defense secretary jim mattis has often said central goal is to increase the xe clethality xe of the united states military
from its early days google has encouraged employees to speak out on issues involving the company it provides internal message boards and social networks where workers challenge management and one another about the company xe products and policies recently the heated debate around google xe efforts to create more diverse work force spilled out into the open
google employees have circulated protest petitions on range of issues including google plus the company xe lagging competitor to facebook and google xe sponsorship of the conservative political action conference
employees raised questions about google xe involvement in project maven at recent companywide meeting at the time diane greene who leads google xe cloud infrastructure business defended the deal and sought to reassure concerned employees company spokesman said most of the signatures on the protest letter had been collected before the company had an opportunity to explain the situation
the company subsequently described its work on project maven as xe cnon offensive xe in nature though the pentagon xe video analysis is routinely used in counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations and defense department publications make clear that the project supports those operations both google and the pentagon said the company xe products would not create an autonomous weapons system that could fire without human operator much debated possibility using artificial intelligence
but improved analysis of drone video could be used to pick out human targets for strikes while also better identifying civilians to reduce the accidental killing of innocent people
without referring directly to the letter to mr pichai google said in statement on tuesday that xe cany military use of machine learning naturally raises valid concerns xe it added xe cwe xe re actively engaged across the company in comprehensive discussion of this important topic xe the company called such exchanges xe chugely important and beneficial xe though several google employees familiar with the letter would speak of it only on the condition of anonymity saying they were concerned about retaliation
the statement said the company xe part of project maven was xe cspecifically scoped to be for non offensive purposes xe though officials declined to make available the relevant contract language the defense department said that because google is subcontractor on project maven to the prime contractor ecs federal it could not provide either the amount or the language of google xe contract ecs federal did not respond to inquiries
google said the pentagon was using xe copen source object recognition software available to any google cloud customer xe and based on unclassified data xe cthe technology is used to flag images for human review and is intended to save lives and save people from having to do highly tedious work xe the company said
some of google xe top executives have significant pentagon connections eric schmidt former executive chairman of google and still member of the executive board of alphabet google xe parent company serves on pentagon advisory body the defense innovation board as does google vice president milo medin
in an interview in november mr schmidt acknowledged xe ca general concern in the tech community of somehow the military industrial complex using their stuff to kill people incorrectly if you will xe he said he served on the board in part xe cto at least allow for communications to occur xe and suggested that the military would xe cuse this technology to help keep the country safe xe
an uneasiness about military contracts among small fraction of google xe more than employees may not pose major obstacle to the company xe growth but in the rarefied area of artificial intelligence research google is engaged in intense competition with other tech companies for the most talented people so recruiters could be hampered if some candidates are put off by google xe defense connections
as google defends its contracts from internal dissent its competitors have not been shy about publicizing their own work on defense projects amazon touts its image recognition work with the department of defense and microsoft has promoted the fact that its cloud technology won contract to handle classified information for every branch of the military and defense agencies
the current dispute first reported by gizmodo is focused on project maven which began last year as pilot program to find ways to speed up the military application of the latest technology it is expected to cost less than million in its first year according to pentagon spokeswoman but the signers of the letter at google clearly hope to discourage the company from entering into far larger pentagon contracts as the defense applications of artificial intelligence grow
google is widely expected to compete with other tech giants including amazon and microsoft for multiyear multibillion dollar contract to provide cloud services to the defense department john gibson the department xe chief management officer said last month that the joint enterprise defense infrastructure cloud procurement program was in part designed to xe cincrease lethality and readiness xe underscoring the difficulty of separating software cloud and related services from the actual business of war
the employees xe protest letter to mr pichai which has been circulated on an internal communications system for several weeks argues that embracing military work could backfire by alienating customers and potential recruits
xe cthis plan will irreparably damage google xe brand and its ability to compete for talent xe the letter says xe camid growing fears of biased and weaponized ai google is already struggling to keep the public xe trust xe it suggests that google risks being viewed as joining the ranks of big defense contractors like raytheon general dynamics and the big data firm palantir
xe cthe argument that other firms like microsoft and amazon are also participating doesn xe make this any less risky for google xe the letter says xe cgoogle xe unique history its motto don xe be evil and its direct reach into the lives of billions of users set it apart xe
like other onetime upstarts turned powerful silicon valley behemoths google is being forced to confront the idealism that guided the company in its early years facebook started with the lofty mission of connecting people all over the world but it has recently come under fire for becoming conduit for fake news and being used by russia to influence the election and sow dissent among american voters
paul scharre former pentagon official and author of xe carmy of none xe forthcoming book on the use of artificial intelligence to build autonomous weapons said the clash inside google was inevitable given the company xe history and the booming demand for in the military
xe cthere xe strong libertarian ethos among tech folks and wariness about the government xe use of technology xe said mr scharre senior fellow at the center for new american security in washington xe cnow is suddenly and quite quickly moving out of the research lab and into real life xe

san francisco xe california regulators have given the green light to truly driverless cars
the state xe department of motor vehicles said monday that it was eliminating requirement for autonomous vehicles to have person in the driver xe seat to take over in the event of an emergency the new rule goes into effect on april
california has given companies license to test self driving vehicles in the state the new rules also require companies to be able to operate the vehicle remotely xe bit like flying military drone xe and communicate with law enforcement and other drivers when something goes wrong
the changes signal step toward the wider deployment of autonomous vehicles one of the main economic benefits praised by proponents of driverless vehicles is that they will not be limited by human boundaries and can do things like operate hours in row without drop off in alertness or attentiveness taking the human out of the front seat is an important psychological and logistical step before truly driverless cars can hit the road
xe cthis is major step forward for autonomous technology in california xe said jean shiomoto director of california xe xe csafety is our top concern and we are ready to begin working with manufacturers that are prepared to test fully driverless vehicles in california xe
while most of the companies leading the race for driverless cars are based in california some have started testing autonomous vehicles in arizona where the state government has taken more hands off approach to the technology arizona has not created regulations for autonomous vehicles
waymo the self driving car unit of google xe parent company alphabet started testing autonomous vehicles without safety drivers on arizona roads in october since then it has picked up passengers in driverless vehicles and it plans to start ride hailing service without human drivers later this year
uber has also deployed autonomous vehicles in arizona but it uses safety drivers in those cars
xe cthis is significant step toward an autonomous future in the state and signals that california is interested in leading by example in the deployment of autonomous vehicles xe sarah abboud an uber spokeswoman said in statement
john simpson director for consumer watchdog frequent critic of alphabet xe self driving car initiative said the new rules will threaten highway safety as remote operators try xe cto control the robot car from afar xe he said the oversight will turn driving these vehicles into video game xe cexcept lives will be at stake xe
california requires companies to report the number of xe cdisengagements xe or instances when human drivers are forced to take over for the autonomous vehicle waymo had the fewest number of disengagements xe based on per mile basis xe of all the companies testing cars on california roads
between december and november waymo xe self driving cars drove about miles and human drivers intervened times xe or about miles between every disengagement over the last few years waymo has made steady progress in reducing the instances when people need to retake the wheel

by renovating symbol of the city xe decline the company hopes to create magnet for the talent needed to prevail in the next automotive era
by neal boudette
detroit xe for the past year ford motor has been working on plan to reinvigorate its operations and jump start profit growth now as that strategy is just being put into place the automaker is taking on another big renovation project the city of detroit and the hulking remains of its dilapidated train station
ford has purchased the michigan central station the abandoned and graffiti covered story office tower and train station that looms over the corktown neighborhood with its smashed and darkened windows the station had long stood as the most recognizable symbol of detroit xe decades of decline
ford sees the move as part of the race for supremacy in the next automotive era
xe cto me this is about inventing the future xe william ford jr the company xe chairman and great grandson of the automaker xe founder said in an interview
the company expects the renovated station where the last train departed in to reopen in about four years it is intended to be the centerpiece of new urban campus that will focus on the developing businesses that use self driving cars like ride hailing services and delivery companies
xe cit xe so much more than just the restoration of an iconic building xe mr ford said while pointing out features of the station xe crumbling interior including its ticket windows and vast open air space that he envisions as glassed in atrium
the once grand depot was built in and features soaring grand hall conceived by the architects who created grand central terminal in new york in the days before air travel it provided dramatic welcome to visitors arriving from new york chicago washington and elsewhere
as residents and employers fled detroit over the years however train traffic dwindled and then ceased and the station became target of vandals graffiti artists and photographers looking to capture images of urban decay it has served as the backdrop for dystopian scenes in music videos and hollywood movies including xe ctransformers xe and xe cbatman vs superman xe and has been used occasionally as an event space
ford has already bought other properties in the area and has moved about employees into building that was once pantyhose factory mr ford said he hoped the corktown campus would be part of technology hotbed attracting start ups investors and other companies working on autonomous vehicles to the west it would include ford xe main engineering center in dearborn and beyond it ann arbor less than an hour away where the university of michigan is leading the development of two testing grounds for self driving vehicles
ford thinks the detroit presence in particular will attract young professionals who now gravitate toward silicon valley and other high tech hubs and typically steer clear of established companies whose corporate ways they see as sterile and rigid it xe the same thinking that prompted mcdonald xe to move to chicago from the city xe suburbs and general electric to relocate to boston from fairfield conn
xe cour goal is to have the autonomous vehicle invented and proved out here and to attract the entrepreneurs and young businesses that will enable that so we really will be able to create the mobility corridor of the next years xe mr ford said
ford is taking on the train station project when it still has plenty of work to do on itself just few years ago ford was the healthiest of the three detroit automakers but it struggled to map out clear strategy on electric vehicles self driving cars and other new technologies it was also slow to add trucks and sport utility vehicles to its model line as americans were flocking to bigger roomier vehicles
last year with profits slumping and its stock price lagging the company replaced its chief executive mark fields with jim hackett former head of the office furniture maker steelcase
xe ci brought jim in year ago because felt we needed to accelerate our pace of decision making and start placing big bets in certain areas and needed to invent the future xe mr ford said
mr hackett has sketched out turnaround plan that calls for billions of dollars in cost cuts and parade of new types of trucks and electric vehicles due to begin arriving in at the same time the company plans to drop most passenger cars from its lineup in the united states including venerable nameplates like the taurus and the fusion mr hackett is counting on these measures to increase ford xe profits to at least percent of global revenue by up from percent in
analysts have criticized the slow rollout of the turnaround effort despite the changes mr hackett has promised ford xe stock price has risen only slightly since his arrival
ford has also been compared unfavorably with its crosstown rival general motors which has been ringing up richer profits and seems to have been moved more quickly in reshaping its strategy and embracing new opportunities for example recently announced that softbank group of japan would invest billion in its autonomous vehicle division
in an interview mr hackett said ford had taken time to make sure its strategy was right xe ci think when we look back on the time it xe taken to make really good decisions it xe going to be held in really high regard xe he said
both mr ford and mr hackett said the renovation of the train station would not slow ford xe efforts to increase profitability the money for the station will come from sum that ford set aside in to overhaul its dearborn headquarters and dozens of nearby buildings
the money xe cwas already in all the forward spending models we had xe mr ford said xe cwe have added no new money to that budget xe
ford bought the building for an undisclosed price from the family of manuel moroun whose holdings include the ambassador bridge linking detroit to windsor ontario
mr ford said perhaps as many as ford employees would work at the corktown campus anchored by the train station
he declined to say how much ford expected the renovation to cost and acknowledged that the final sum could rise above current estimates xe cwhenever you get into renovation you don xe know what you don xe know xe he said
but with economic incentives from the state of michigan xe expected to be detailed at an event with state and city officials at the station on tuesday xe the cost of the renovation xe cactually looks very favorable xe mr ford said
as ford was building team edison to focus on new businesses related to autonomous vehicles mr ford and company executives concluded that they would need new location apart from dearborn to house the group it had to be an urban location where generation professionals would want to work and where self driving cars would need to operate during the search for such location mr ford said the potential of the train station and the possible impact on detroit stood out
he said he recalled going to the train station as boy for family trips to california and had distant family connection to corktown his ford relatives came to detroit from county cork in ireland in the th century and he visited the city of cork last year
no plans for the station have been drawn up but mr ford would like the grand hall and ground floors to be public space filled with stores restaurants and coffee shops xe cwe really want this to be hub of life for this part of town xe he said
in detroit the prospect of the station xe revival has fanned optimism over the city xe future in recent years the city has seen spurts of investment and development that have brought some vibrancy to some parts of the city dan gilbert founder of quicken loans moved his company xe headquarters to downtown detroit and has spent an estimated billion to buy and renovate more than vacant properties in the surrounding area in september little caesars arena opened as the new home of the detroit red wings hockey team while new light rail line links downtown with an area known as midtown
corktown just west of downtown was once lively neighborhood settled by irish immigrants that featured shops pubs and restaurants clustered around the old tiger stadium razed in the area has several popular dining spots but many empty lots and vacant buildings
xe cthis is really big transformational event in the city xe revitalization xe said sandy baruah chief executive of the detroit regional chamber xe cit xe going to pull development of the city westward and to have global investor in detroit is really green light to outside investors xe
while ford xe commitment to corktown is potential milestone the city still faces many challenges its school system is troubled public transportation into and inside detroit is scant and many neighborhoods remain blighted with some abandoned homes
xe ci don xe want to pretend that there aren xe some heavy lifts ahead of us xe mr baruah said
for now though ford xe plan to renovate the station suggests that detroit is on the rise

the vast majority of americans expect artificial intelligence to lead to job losses in the coming decade but few see it coming for their own position
and despite the expected decline in employment the public widely embraces artificial intelligence in attitude and in practice about five in six americans already use product or service that features it according to survey that was conducted last fall and from which new findings were released on tuesday
xe cwhether they know it or not has moved into big percent of americans xe lives in one way or another already xe said frank newport the editor in chief of gallup which conducted the survey with northeastern university
the study defines artificial intelligence as any technology that can perform task as humans do but even if that definition feels overly broad the findings reveal just how ubiquitous certain products have become in american life
about percent of americans for example use navigation apps like google maps waze and apple maps the study found about percent of respondents said they streamed music or video with services like netflix and pandora
nearly half said they used personal assistants on their smartphones while about percent use ride sharing apps some percent used intelligent home personal assistants like google home or amazon xe alexa twenty percent said they use smart home device such as self learning light or thermostat
the technologies were used most widely among younger and more educated americans more than percent of adults with at least bachelor xe degree or between the ages of and used navigation apps for example
the report that was released on tuesday reflects only some of the findings of large survey of nearly american adults conducted in september and october
the other findings released in january show that more than three in four americans believe that artificial intelligence will fundamentally change how the public works and lives in the coming decade
about the same share expect artificial intelligence to destroy more jobs than it creates though only about one in four were worried about losing their own job

gregor sailer traveled the globe photographing potemkin villages architectural landscapes that are clones impostors or frauds
by andrew dickson
arles france xe the neighborhood looks unremarkable if little unkempt dollar store laundromat fashion business with few other sidelines xe call cellphone bills paid here xe the sky is heavy the color of pewter snow blankets the sidewalk the adverts for the new york lottery in the grocery store windows are giveaway but something is off what district of new york city is one story high and can those be pine trees in the background
the caption to the photograph reveals that this isn xe new york at all of course but sweden life size replica of harlem in forest in the west of the country near gothenburg the asphalt and snow are real enough but nearly everything else is fake the streets are void of people and cars the store fronts are life size photographs printed on canvas and hung on steel frames welcome to the potemkin village place of clones impostors facsimiles frauds maybe don xe plan to stay
the rencontres xe arles photography festival offers plenty to tease and fool the eye but xe cthe potemkin village xe project by the austrian photographer gregor sailer installed in former cathedral in the center of town is arguably the most fraudulent of the lot notionally set of architectural landscapes shot in seven countries and three continents it in fact exhibits places that are non places real estate that is also unreal and surreal the swedish harlem turns out to be test track for self driving cars why is it decorated as new york xe rather than say stockholm
xe ci don xe know why they did that xe mr sailer said with shrug xe ca little crazy xe
legendarily potemkin villages were the structures erected in honor of the russian ruler catherine the great when she toured her domains in the late th century anxious to spare the empress from the grim realities of the crimean countryside the nobleman grigory aleksandrovich potemkin reputedly ordered that whole towns be constructed out of prettily painted wood xe just like the real thing if his boss didn xe peer too hard mr sailer gave the concept st century spin lugging his large format film camera to sites erected by governmental military or city agencies
some of these locations have been seen before the ersatz chinese towns built to resemble weimar germany or henley on thames england have attracted many photographers over recent years amused by the idea of whole cities that are counterfeits but mr sailer treats them with deadpan seriousness not series of one liners with their diluted colors and flattened light these photographs are serenely beautiful
he explained that he tried to take only one image in each location conceptual rigor that forced him to scrutinize every element in front of him xe cit sharpens my process xe he said
some might think of the industrial buildings obsessively cataloged by bernd and hilla becher or the vacant cityscapes of thomas struth and masataka nakano they could also be seen as wry response to the traditions of street photography xe except that whereas the city streets captured by garry winogrand and lee friedlander crackle with people and energy here there are barely any humans to be glimpsed at all
xe cit xe always very important for me to include the aesthetic aspect xe mr sailer said xe ceven if it xe the beauty of the apocalypse or oppression it is beautiful xe
perhaps the most arresting of these images are of the classified military sites constructed to enable soldiers to train in places that look like conflict zones in some cases mr sailer waited months to gain access his visits had to be choreographed around tank movements and live fire and the photographs vetted by military authorities
none of that action makes their way into these photographs instead what comes across is the stillness of these spaces and their sinister plausibility in one picture chunks of fake meat hang from mocked up butcher xe shop and the signs are written in arabic bag hdad perhaps another an antiterrorism training site in france there are apartment complexes that look ready to move into in these stage sets for the theater of war the designers have worked hard to get every detail just so
among historians there is dispute about whether catherine the great xe potemkin villages ever existed mr sailer admitted he had doubts but pointed out that in he traveled to the russian village of suzdal north of moscow upon arriving he discovered half collapsed shacks that had been sheathed in attractive hoardings three years earlier hearing that president vladimir putin was to pay visit local officials had scrambled to smarten suzdal up and had created half imaginary town in the process one calculated not to offend ruler xe eye
mr sailer smiled xe csome things never change think xe

transit advocates fear that unrealistic hopes for new technology xe and how soon it xe ll get here xe could lead cities down the wrong path
by emily badger
autonomous vehicles that will outperform buses cost less than uber and travel faster than cars stuck in traffic today are two years away or or
but visions of the future they xe ll bring have already crept into city council meetings political campaigns state legislation and decisions about what cities should build today that unnerves some transportation planners and transit advocates who fear unrealistic hopes for driverless cars xe and how soon they xe ll get here xe could lead cities to mortgage the present for something better they haven xe seen
xe cthey have imbued autonomous vehicles with the possibility to solve every problem that was ever created in transportation since the beginning of time xe said beth osborne senior policy adviser with the advocacy group transportation for america xe cthat might be tad bit unrealistic xe
in indianapolis detroit and nashville opponents of major transit investments have argued that buses and trains will soon seem antiquated in silicon valley politicians have suggested something better and cheaper is on the way as new york xe subway demands repairs futurists have proposed paving over all that rail instead for underground highways
autonomous cars have entered policy debates xe if not car lots xe with remarkable speed and everyone agrees that making the wrong bets now would be costly cities that abandon transit will come to regret it advocates warn driverless car boosters counter that officials wedded to xe th century technology xe will block innovation and waste billions
xe cwe are definitely going to have pushback xe said brad templeton longtime silicon valley software architect who preaches the potential of xe crobocars xe he believes the subway paved over in concrete for autonomous vehicles could transport more passengers than rail can xe ci regularly run into people who even when they see the efficiency numbers just believe there is something pure and good about riding together that it must be the right answer xe
his advice to cities xe cinfrastructure plans for are sure to be obsolete xe
in some ways this is choice we xe ve faced before the marketing simulations at autonomous car conferences remind jeffrey tumlin transportation consultant of futurama the world xe fair exhibit sponsored by general motors that introduced the public to future of xe cmagic motorways xe
xe cnothing has changed at all xe said mr tumlin principal with the firm nelson nygaard xe cit is the world xe fair and it is so exciting there xe the model and traffic is flowing smoothly and there xe this promise of limitless free mobility xe
if you believe that autonomous cars will compete with transit rather than complement it xe or that autonomous ride hailing will give cities that never built transit something like it xe there is appeal in holding out now
xe cdon xe build light rail system now please please please please don xe xe said frank chen partner with the venture capital firm andreessen horowitz xe cwe don xe understand the economics of self driving cars because we haven xe experienced them yet let xe see how it plays out xe
theoretically when companies like uber and lyft no longer have to pay drivers rides could be as cheap as bus fare and when autonomous vehicles platoon they could squeeze more capacity and speed out of roadways eroding some of the timesaving advantages of railways
technologists also draw an analogy to the internet infrastructure that was conceived to be simple and uniform compatible with any application the intelligence lay in what was built on the internet not the internet itself for cities mr templeton suggests this means xe csmart cars and stupid roads xe just lay concrete and let innovators design what rides on top of it by definition he said rail precludes all possibilities other than the train
inherent in this idea is the fear that cities will lock in the wrong future or that they xe ll prevent better ideas from arriving they xe ll bet for example on docked bike sharing systems and then be caught off guard when dockless scooters arrive
xe ci get very nervous when city planners or municipal bus operators are making technology bets xe mr chen said xe cthat xe hard enough for us and we live and die by the quality of the technology bets we make xe
public transportation agencies can certainly be inflexible frank martz the city manager of altamonte springs fla envisioned service in the late that was basically uber before smartphones he wanted to allow riders to use computers or kiosks to order smaller vehicles with optimized routes the local transit agency struggled to bring his idea to life
xe cthey just could not think about anything other than buses and bus lanes and drivers and unions xe mr martz said xe cthey could not think about the user xe
this month altamonte springs finished two year pilot offering discounts on uber rides instead model that appeals to the belief that private companies can provide these services better anyway
xe ci expect by most transit agencies are going to be zombie agencies that exist mainly to collect taxes from people to pay down their debt xe said randal xe toole senior fellow with the libertarian cato institute who blogs provocatively as xe cthe antiplanner xe in the meantime he argues that cities should put no new money into infrastructure
he acknowledged that he believed transit was wasteful for taxpayers long before everyone got excited about driverless cars but now he and others who say no to transit also have something positive to say something better is coming
las vegas has been preparing to build precisely the thing these critics say they shouldn xe the region xe first light rail line the city is running several autonomous pilots too but officials aren xe sold on the imminent driverless future
xe cit xe very easy to get caught up in these sensationalized visions xe said tina quigley general manager of the regional transportation commission of southern nevada xe csome of these visions may eventually come to fruition but we are not talking about them happening in the next five years even some of them in the next years xe
many potential benefits of driverless cars won xe kick in until there is mass adoption even in that distant future ms quigley said there simply won xe be enough space in the busiest corridors for everyone to ride in an autonomous vehicle
highways today can carry about cars per lane per hour autonomous vehicles might quadruple that the best rail systems can carry more than passengers per lane per hour they move the most people using the least space no technology can overcome that geometry said jarrett walker portland based transportation consultant
xe clet xe talk about what we can predict xe he said xe cthe problem of the city is problem of sharing space in the problem of the city will still be problem of sharing space xe
by that logic cities should invest even more in high capacity rail and dedicated bus lanes in key corridors autonomous vehicles might handle other kinds of trips xe rides from the train station home or through suburban neighborhoods or across the parts of las vegas without rail
this possibility is not radically different from today uber and lyft offer the closest approximation to how people will behave in an autonomous future when consumers use cars they don xe own both companies are frequently cited by opponents of transit but they also now back big transit investments without which their riders in congested cities would be stuck in even worse traffic
no system of autonomous cars could be more efficient than the new york subway said andrew salzberg uber xe head of transportation policy and research uber needs that transit just as it will need electric scooters and bikes and the congestion pricing it also supports in new york to ensure that cheaper transportation doesn xe simply lead to more traffic
the efficiency that autonomous vehicles promise is more likely if people share them xe and don xe use them for every trip
cities fixated on that future however could be making another risky bet new forms of transportation like uber and lyft are heavily subsidized by venture capital today and so cities that expect private services to replace public transit are counting on those subsidies too they xe re betting that driverless cars will get here changing the economics of transportation before the venture capitalists lose patience
emily badger writes about cities and urban policy for the upshot from the san francisco bureau she particularly interested in housing transportation and inequality xe and how they re all connected she joined the times in from the washington post emilymbadger

san francisco xe more than second before self driving car operated by uber struck and killed pedestrian in march the vehicle xe computer system determined it needed to brake to avoid crash but built in emergency braking system had been disabled while the car was in autonomous mode to ensure smoother ride according to the preliminary report of federal regulators investigating the crash
the initial findings released on thursday by the national transportation safety board confirmed early police reports about the episode which was the first known pedestrian fatality involving an autonomous car
the report also affirmed what many experts on self driving cars said in the days after the crash uber xe cars are loaded with sensors and cameras that should have detected pedestrian with plenty of time to stop but this one failed through combination of computer system not responding properly to the pedestrian xe presence and distracted safety driver
the fatal crash has raised questions about the safety of testing self driving cars on public roads and whether companies in their rush to be among the first to deploy this breakthrough technology are taking enough precautions to prevent harm to other drivers and pedestrians it has also dampened some enthusiasm for self driving cars as technology that researchers believe could eventually save lives because robot drivers unlike humans don xe get distracted or tired and obey traffic rules
the new york times reported that uber xe cars had been struggling to meet reliability standards in arizona before the crash its cars required human drivers to intervene much more frequently than those of its competitors uber was also asking safety drivers to do more xe driving solo instead of in pairs xe even though the cars were still performing erratically
the safety board said the uber car xe computer system spotted year old elaine herzberg pushing bicycle across road at night in tempe ariz six seconds before impact the system classified ms herzberg who was not in crosswalk first as an unrecognized object then as another vehicle and finally as bicycle but it did not slow down before barreling into her at miles per hour the car xe software system is not designed to alert the driver of an object in the road
the uber car volvo xc sport utility vehicle equipped with uber xe sensing technology comes with an automatic emergency braking system from the manufacturer
but uber disabled that function as well as other safety features to xe creduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior xe according to the report this put the onus on the safety driver to intervene to avoid crash if necessary the agency said uber xe safety driver who was not impaired grabbed the steering wheel in an attempt to swerve at the last second but did not start braking until after impact
the vehicle xe operator who was seen on dashboard cameras looking down and away from the road before the crash told investigators that she had been monitoring the self driving car system in the center of the car xe dashboard toxicology report for the victim came back positive for methamphetamine and marijuana investigators said though they did not say drugs played factor in the crash
while the safety board xe preliminary report did not determine fault it pointed to instances where uber xe testing system failed to prevent the crash
xe cthe circumstances of the crash was certainly damning and this report documents it xe said bryant walker smith an assistant professor of law at the university of south carolina who specializes in technology and law xe cmany of the issues raised in the report lead right back to uber and uber xe testing program as legitimate target of criticism xe
mary cummings an engineering professor at duke university who studies the interaction between humans and autonomous vehicles said there was xe ca lack of maturity xe in uber xe testing program because it was asking the drivers to do too much the company made it hard for them to focus on their primary task ensuring safety
sarah abboud an uber spokeswoman said the company had worked closely with investigators over the last two months it has started review of its self driving car program and plans to announce changes to its safety procedures in the coming weeks uber has brought on christopher hart former chairman of the safety board as an adviser on its xe coverall safety culture xe
immediately after the crash uber suspended testing of its self driving cars and has not yet returned to the road
on wednesday the company said it was shutting down its testing operations in arizona and laying off employees saying it wanted to move testing closer to its engineering hubs in pittsburgh and san francisco uber also said it hoped to return to the road in pittsburgh by the summer the company has not said when it hopes the autonomous cars will return to san francisco
but even politicians who once welcomed self driving cars onto their roads are striking more cautious tone william peduto pittsburgh xe mayor said the city would require uber xe cars stay under miles per hour regardless of the road xe speed limit
still the crash hasn xe significantly altered the deployment or testing plans for uber xe rivals
waymo the self driving car company spun out from google has been testing cars without safety driver in arizona where it is also picking up passengers as part of test deployment of an autonomous taxi service waymo said it expected to start accepting fares for its self driving taxis this year and cruise self driving car company owned by gm has continued testing in california
an earlier version of the article misstated when the safety driver in an autonomous uber vehicle that fatally struck pedestrian in tempe ariz tried to start braking it was less than second after impact not less than second before

randomized controlled trials despite their flaws remain powerful tool
by aaron carroll
the gold standard of medical research the randomized controlled trial has been taking bit of beating lately
an entire issue of the journal social science and medicine was recently devoted to it with many articles pointing to shortcomings others have argued that randomized controlled trials often can xe address the questions that patients and physicians most want answered recently wrote about the limitations of the method in studying effectiveness which is what we care about in real world situations
but the randomized controlled trial remains powerful tool it xe still perhaps the best method for conducting explanatory research in past articles have recounted numerous times when hypotheses from observational studies those based solely on observations of particular groups have failed to be confirmed by controlled trial
perhaps the greatest strength of the randomized controlled trial is in combating what xe known as selection bias that occurs when groups being studied intervention and control are already significantly different after they are xe cselected xe to be in the intervention or not one of the most elegant examples of why we need such trials came recently in an examination of employer sponsored wellness programs
these programs are usually offered by employers to make their employees healthier they can offer screening for variety of reversible conditions access to weight loss programs or gyms encouragement and support and sometimes even chronic disease management many of the analyses of these programs have shown positive results
almost all of those analyses are observational though they look at programs in company and compare people who participate with those who don xe when those who participate do better we tend to think that wellness programs are associated with better outcomes some of us start to believe they xe re causing better outcomes
the most common concern with such studies is that those who participate are different from those who don xe in ways unrelated to the program itself maybe those people participating were already healthier maybe they were richer or didn xe drink too much or were younger all of these things could bias the study in some way
the best of these observational studies try to control for these variables even so we can never be sure that there aren xe unmeasured factors known as confounders that are changing the results
confounding is classic problem of selection bias so perhaps the best way to be sure that the two groups aren xe different is to remove selection from their hands by randomly assigning participation
but that xe hard to do with wellness program especially since they are put into place for the entire company it xe expensive and requires lot of time and there xe no clear funder who might want to sponsor it that is until recently
this year researchers published results from the illinois workplace wellness study large randomized controlled trial of wellness program at the university of illinois at urbana champaign almost employees volunteered to participate in the study
more than of these were randomly put in the control group which basically received no services about were invited to receive biometric health screening and an online health risk assessment they were then offered number of wellness activities including classes on weight loss exercise tai chi smoking cessation financial wellness and more they were even offered financial incentives of various amounts for completing screenings and participating in activities
of course not everyone given an opportunity to engage in such activities will take it but more than half of those offered the program participated the researchers followed everyone in both the control and intervention group for year to see how the program affected their activities their health their productivity and their medical spending
the results were disappointing there seemed to be no causal effects
here xe the nerdy fun part though in addition to this analysis the researchers also took the time to analyze the data as if it were an observational trial in other words they took the who were offered the wellness program then analyzed them the way typical observational trial would comparing those who participated with those who didn xe
the results were very different from those of the controlled trial
if we look only at the intervention group as an observational trial it appears that people who didn xe make use of the program went to the campus gym days per year and those who participated in it went times per year based on that the program appears to be success but when the intervention group is compared with the control group as randomized controlled trial the differences disappear those in the control group went times per year and those in the intervention group went times per year
researchers looked at whether people participated in race like marathon kilometer run or five kilometer run the observational analysis comparing nonparticipants with participants showed significant difference in running percent of people versus percent the randomized controlled trial on the other hand found percent versus percent
wellness programs sometimes claim to save money by reducing health care spending the observational analysis supports this belief it found that participants spent significantly less than nonparticipants on health care versus and on hospital related costs versus the randomized controlled trial showed that the wellness program had little effect on spending compared with the control group in both overall spending versus and hospital spending versus
the researchers even looked at the percentage of people who left their job for any reason in the observational analysis percent of nonparticipants did so compared with only percent of participants it appears from such an analysis that wellness programs are associated with retaining workers but the randomized controlled trial showed that no such causal link exists as percent of the control group exited the job compared with percent of the intervention group
why such stark differences xe cthe most likely explanation is that participants differ from nonparticipants in very important ways xe said julian reif one of the study xe principal investigators xe ctherefore when wellness program is offered the differences seen between those who take advantage of it and those who don xe are due to differences in the people rather than differences from the program xe
often the best we can do for an observational trial is to try to adjust xe control researchers say xe for variables we can measure and that might also affect the results these researchers did in one analysis they controlled for sex age race salary and status as faculty or staff they still found that the results of the observational analysis were significant for all the outcomes discussed above in an even more heavily controlled analysis they used machine learning to decide whether to control for even more variables including but not limited to past health smoking and drinking status pre intervention exercise medication use and sick days taken
the differences were unchanged
xe cif we had published only these observational analyses the headline result could have been that even after controlling for battery of confounding variables participation in wellness program was associated with significant reduction in health care spending an improvement in exercise and lower chance of ceasing employment xe said david molitor another principal investigator of the study
all of that would have led us astray the wellness program appeared to cause none of those things
this doesn xe mean that we should never believe the results of observational trials many show significant results that stand the test of time but in every case we need to weigh the possibility that the people who were studied were selected in way that made them very different from those who weren xe selected or the general population this appears to be the case with those who participate in wellness program
of course not everything can be studied by controlled trials sometimes they are unethical or too expensive or the causal effects are too far downstream from the intervention to detect within the length of the study xe cit xe important to note our results so far only cover the first year of the program xe said damon jones another investigator of the study xe cthere is chance we may see different patterns over the longer term as we continue to collect data xe
observational research can be the best way to study population level effects in those cases many researchers are exploring new techniques like the use of regression discontinuity technique to create quasi randomized groups for analysis
still randomized controlled trials remain much more reliable and useful than other types of studies in our eagerness to point out their flaws we shouldn xe overlook their benefits

the commerce department is considering national security restrictions on artificial intelligence some worry they could stunt the industry in the

san francisco xe common belief among tech industry insiders is that silicon valley has dominated the internet because much of the worldwide network was designed and built by americans
now growing number of those insiders are worried that proposed export restrictions could short circuit the pre eminence of american companies in the next big thing to hit their industry artificial intelligence
in november the commerce department released list of technologies including artificial intelligence that are under consideration for new export rules because of their importance to national security
technology experts worry that blocking the export of to other countries or tying it up in red tape will help industries flourish in those nations xe china in particular xe and compete with american companies
xe cthe number of cases where exports can be sufficiently controlled are very very very small and the chance of making an error is quite large xe said jack clark head of policy at openai an artificial intelligence lab in san francisco xe cif this goes wrong it could do real damage to the community xe
the export controls are being considered as the united states and china engage in trade war the trump administration has been critical of the way china negotiates deals with american companies often requiring the transfer of technology to chinese partners as the cost of doing business in the country and federal officials are making an aggressive argument that china has stolen american technology through hacking and industrial espionage
tech companies academics and policymakers are calling on the commerce department to take light hand with export rules ahead of jan deadline for public comment their argument has three main points restrictions could harm companies in the united states and help international competitors they could stifle technology improvements and they may not make much of difference
in august congress passed the export controls act of which added export restrictions to xe cemerging and foundational technologies xe in mid november the commerce department tasked with overseeing the restrictions published list of technologies for consideration including several categories of like computer vision speech recognition and natural language understanding
the restrictions would affect the export of technology to certain countries though it does not specify which ones the commerce department proposal points to countries that have faced trade and arms embargoes in the past those include china russia and iran
the commerce department declined to comment on the proposed restrictions after taking public comments the department will draft formal plan it could result in anything from new licensing rules for exports to outright bans
artificial intelligence could be as vital to the tech industry as the world wide web was years ago
it is easy to forget that before the mid the tech industry in the united states was in slump and the consumer electronics giants of japan looked unbeatable that changed as silicon valley companies popularized innovations like the web browser and commerce today the likes of google apple and facebook dominate tech all over the world
but american dominion in artificial intelligence is far from guaranteed china is investing billions in for both commercial and military use and the expertise that has flooded to silicon valley over the years is starting to stay home partly because of immigration restrictions centers for research are popping up all over the world from toronto to cambridge england and beijing
enforcing export controls on artificial intelligence would present an unusual challenge for regulators
is something policymakers call dual use technology it has innocuous commercial applications like helping to steer your car or ask your phone question it also has important military uses like helping weaponized drone find its targets
defense planners believe represents the next notable change in military weapons akin to the tactical targeting of so called smart bombs generation ago or nuclear weapons before that can also aid surveillance systems and even disinformation campaigns through software that can produce fake photos and videos
but xe ctrying to draw line between what is military and what is commercial is exceedingly difficult xe said david edelman technology policy researcher at the massachusetts institute of technology xe cit may be impossible xe
it is difficult to put xe cmade in america xe label on artificial intelligence research on the technology is often done collaboratively by scientists and engineers all over the world
companies rarely hold on to the details of their work as if it were secret recipe instead they share what they learn in hopes that other researchers can build on it one company xe xe cbreakthrough xe is often the latest iteration of what many researchers at private companies and universities have been working on
lot of the computer code for is published on sites like arxiv org repository of academic and corporate research so many policy experts believe that if the united states restricts the export of products and services it will have little effect on the progress of in china and other countries
xe cthe core of these technologies is international and freely available xe said mr edelman who was special assistant for economic and technology policy under president barack obama xe cno country xe the or china xe has monopoly on that xe
federal regulations exempt publicly available information from export control that means that the government is unlikely to bar companies and universities from publishing fundamental research but it could establish controls that restrict foreign access to that information said greg jaeger lawyer at the law firm stroock amp stroock amp lavan who deals with export controls
the commerce department could also restrict the export of cloud computing technology and computer chips related to artificial intelligence the export restrictions memo mentions both
amazon and microsoft already operate cloud computing businesses in china through local partners and google has long hoped to do the same thing amazon google and microsoft declined to comment
overly restrictive rules that prevent foreign nationals from working on certain technologies in the united states could also push researchers and companies into other countries
xe cit might be easier for people to just do this stuff in europe xe said jason waite lawyer with the firm alston amp bird who specializes in international trade

apple google and facebook this week erased from their services many xe but not all xe videos podcasts and posts from the right wing conspiracy theorist alex jones and his infowars site and twitter left mr jones xe posts untouched
the differing approaches to mr jones exposed how unevenly tech companies enforce their rules on hate speech and offensive content there are only few cases in which the companies appear to consistently apply their policies such as their ban on child pornography and instances in which the law required them to remove content like nazi imagery in germany
when left to make their own decisions the tech companies often struggle with their roles as the arbiters of speech and leave false information upset users and confusing decisions in their wake here is look at what the companies which control the world xe most popular public forums allow and ban
of all the tech companies facebook has faced the biggest public outcry over what it allows on its platform
whenever the social media company has been pressed to explain its decision making it has referred to its community standards public document that outlines facebook xe rules for users the company has outright bans against violent content nudity and terrorist recruitment propaganda the rules on other types of content including hate speech and false news are more ambiguous
when asked about infowars last month facebook xe chief executive mark zuckerberg said he wouldn xe remove pages hosting popular conspiracy theories of the type mr jones is known for sharing mr zuckerberg then turned the conversation to the subject of the holocaust defending facebook users who deny the holocaust occurred
his awkward explanation prompted outrage and less than day later mr zuckerberg offered public apology
now less than month later facebook has banned mr jones and removed four pages belonging to him xe including one with nearly million followers xe for violating its policies the ban means that while mr jones still has an account and can view content on facebook he is suspended from posting anything to the platform including to his personal page or any pages on which he is an administrator
in post facebook said it banned mr jones and his pages for xe caccumulating too many strikes xe
the company has refused to say how many strikes is too many however it has also not answered questions on how long mr jones will be banned or whether facebook will be reviewing similar content posted by other right wing conspiracy theorists
it xe unclear whether the actions facebook has taken against mr jones signal new approach by the company against hate speech or whether they are once again responding to an isolated case because of public pressure

of all the major online services google xe youtube is probably the most explicit about what is and is not allowed but even with its published xe ccommunity guidelines xe youtube has wrestled with the subjective interpretation of those rules
users can flag videos that they believe violate those guidelines which include bans on videos with nudity or sexual content or incite violence youtube will then review those flagged videos for potential violations in addition youtube xe computer systems also comb the site for videos that violate its rules
but many videos operate in gray area even in youtube xe own explanation of xe chateful content xe the company calls it is xe cdelicate balancing act xe between free expression and protecting youtube users
youtube still hosts videos of ahmad musa jibril an islamic cleric from dearborn mich whose sermons were viewed by one of the knife wielding attackers in the terror attack on london bridge last year his sermons posed quandary for the video service because the cleric does not directly call for violent jihad and is therefore not in clear violation of community guidelines youtube now presents mr jibril xe sermons behind warning that the video has been deemed xe cinappropriate or offensive xe by part of the youtube community
mr jones incurred two content violations from youtube over the last year in february youtube said he had violated its policies regarding harassment and bullying when video claiming that david hogg one of the outspoken student survivors of the school shooting in parkland fla was xe ccrisis actor xe
in mr jones xe most recent violation last month youtube took down four of his videos that included hate speech against muslim and transgender people as well as footage of child being shoved to the ground youtube said the videos had violated its policies pertaining to hate speech harassment and child endangerment

twitter has been more permissive of controversial content than its social media peers with executives calling it xe the free speech wing of the free speech party xe while facebook removes nude or gory images twitter is more tolerant of adult and violent content rather than deleting these kinds of images twitter tends to hide them behind warnings that require users to click through before they can see the content
twitter xe approach has provoked plenty of criticism particularly around its lax handling of harassment celebrities like the actress leslie jones have been temporarily driven off the platform by swarms of abusers
jack dorsey the company xe chief executive has said that the company needed to do better at policing trolls in december twitter said it would promote xe healthy conversation xe by using combination of human moderation and machine learning to detect trolls and minimize the appearance of their posts on the platform
although the parents of several sandy hook shooting victims are suing mr jones for defamation twitter spokesman said that neither mr jones xe personal account nor his infowars account are currently in violation of twitter xe policies tweets questioning the school shooting in newtown conn remain live on both accounts
the simultaneous takedowns across youtube spotify and facebook are troubling said kevin bankston the director of the open technology institute at new america nonpartisan research organization in washington the number of bans in quick succession from multiple companies raised the specter that this could have been influenced by outside political pressure rather than straightforward application of company policies he said
twitter xe decision to allow mr jones and infowars to stay on its platform may reflect commitment to consistent policy enforcement mr bankston said
xe ca twitter that xe not accountable to its own rules is not accountable to anybody xe he said
in series of tweets late tuesday mr dorsey suggested that other tech companies had caved to political pressure in their decision to remove mr jones from their platforms and argued that journalists xe not twitter xe were better suited to fact checking mr jones xe claims
xe che hasn xe violated our rules xe mr dorsey wrote xe cwe xe re going to hold jones to the same standard we hold to every account not taking one off actions to make us feel good in the short term and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories xe

without social media platform apple typically avoids the content controversies that ensnare its peers yet the iphone maker still makes many decisions about what apps podcasts songs and videos it will make available on its popular services
apple on sunday banned five of the six infowars podcasts from its podcasts service apple determined the sixth podcast realnews with david knight did not violate its policies which prohibit podcasts that xe ccould be construed as racist misogynist or homophobic xe or that depict xe cgraphic sex violence gore illegal drugs or hate themes xe in the past apple has also removed neo nazi songs and the nazi anthem from itunes
apple xe decision to ban the infowars podcasts was surprising partly because an app that infowars introduced last month was gaining steam on apple xe app store from july through monday the infowars app was on average the rd most popular news app on the app store according to app annie an app analytics firm on tuesday after news of mr jones xe bans spread the infowars app was apple xe fourth most popular news app outranking every mainstream news organization
apple reviews all apps that apply for its app store and determined that the infowars app did not violate its rules apple posts extensive policies for apps that it distributes including prohibitions on xe ccontent that is offensive insensitive upsetting intended to disgust or in exceptionally poor taste xe the policies give series of examples including content that is defamatory discriminatory meanspirited overtly sexual encourages violence or includes xe crealistic portrayals of people or animals being killed maimed tortured or abused xe
how apple decides which apps violate those policies is more vague however apple said in its policy xe cwe will reject apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line what line you ask well as supreme court justice once said xe xe ll know it when see it xe and we think that you will also know it when you cross it xe

tay said terrible things she was racist xenophobic and downright filthy at one point she said the holocaust did not happen but she was old technology
let loose on the internet nearly two years ago tay was an experimental system built by microsoft she was designed to chat with digital hipsters in breezy sometimes irreverent lingo and american netizens quickly realized they could coax her into spewing vile and offensive language this was largely the result of simple design flaw xe tay was programmed to repeat what was said to her xe but the damage was done within hours microsoft shut her down for good
since then new breed of conversational technology has emerged inside microsoft and other internet giants that is far more nimble and effective than the techniques that underpinned tay and researchers believe these new systems will improve at an even faster rate when they are let loose on the internet but sometimes like tay these conversational systems reflect the worst of human nature and given the history here companies like microsoft are reluctant to set them free xe at least for now
these systems do not simply repeat what is said to them or respond with canned answers they teach themselves to carry on conversation by carefully analyzing reams of real human dialogue at microsoft for instance new system learns to chat by analyzing thousands of online discussions pulled from services like twitter and reddit when you send this bot message it chooses response after generating dozens of possibilities and ranking each according to how well it mirrors those human conversations
if you complain about breaking your ankle during football game it is nimble enough to give you some sympathy xe couch that xe not good xe it might say xe chope your ankle feels better soon xe if you mention house guests or dinner plans it responds in remarkably precise and familiar ways
despite its sophistication this conversational system can also be nonsensical impolite and even offensive at times if you mention your company xe it may assume you are talking about man xe unaware that women are chief executives too if you ask simple question you may get cheeky reply
microsoft xe researchers believe they can significantly improve this technology by having it chat with large numbers of people this would help identify its flaws and generate much sharper conversational data for the system to learn from xe cit is problem if we can xe get this in front of real users xe and have them tell us what is right and what isn xe xe said longtime microsoft researcher bill dolan
but there lies the conundrum because its flaws could spark public complaints xe and bad press xe microsoft is wary of pushing this technology onto the internet
the project represents much wider effort to build new breed of computing system that is truly conversational at companies like facebook amazon and salesforce as well as microsoft the hope is that this technology will provide smoother and easier ways of interacting with machines xe easier than keyboard and mouse easier than touch screen easier than siri and other digital assistants now on the market which are still long way from fluid conversation
for years silicon valley companies trumpeted xe cchatbots xe that could help you say book your next plane flight or solve problem with your new computer tablet but these have never lived up to the billing providing little more than canned responses to common queries
now thanks to the rise of algorithms that can quickly learn tasks on their own research in conversational computing is advancing but the industry as whole faces the same problem as microsoft the new breed of chatbot talks more like human but that is not always good thing
xe cit is more powerful xe said alex lebrun who works on similar conversational systems at facebook xe artificial intelligence lab in paris xe cbut it is more dangerous xe
the new breed relies on xe neural networks xe complex algorithms that can learn tasks by identifying patterns in large pools of data over the last five years these algorithms have accelerated the evolution of systems that can automatically recognize faces and objects identify commands spoken into smartphones and translate from one language to another they are also speeding the development of conversational systems xe though this research is significantly more complex and will take longer to mature
it may seem surprising that microsoft researchers are training their conversational system on dialogue from twitter and reddit two social networking services known for vitriolic content but even on twitter and reddit people are generally civil when they really fall into conversation and these services are brimming with this kind of dialogue
microsoft researchers massage the conversational data they load into the system in small ways but for the most part they simply feed the raw dialogues into their neural networks and these algorithms therefore learn from interactions that are very human according to mr dolan in analyzing this data the system learns to perform well even in the face of poor spelling and grammar if you type xe cwinne tonight drink resttaurant xe it might respond with xe ci xe not fan of wine xe it can engage in real back and forth dialogue asking for everything it needs to say connect with you on linkedin and for the most part it behaves with civility
when microsoft xe conversational system receives message it generates dozens of possible responses and ranks each according to how well it mirrors human dialogue in this case the system knows enough about the world to identify adele as singer
response
rank
she singer
don know who adele is
she is singer
lana del rey
don know who she is but she is singer
don know who she is but she singer
don know not fan of adele
lana del ray
don know who she is she singer
who is adele
don know who she is she singer
don know who she is but she good singer
don know who she is not fan of adele
don know who she is but she is very good singer
don know who she is she is singer
don know her name she singer
don know her name she singer
she not singer
don know ve never heard of her before
you don know her
don know her name
don know ve never heard of her
katy perry
don know who she is but don know her name
don really know who she is but don know her name
but researchers must also deal with the unexpected though these conversational systems are generally civil they are sometimes rude xe or worse it is not just that the technology is new and flawed because they learn from vast amounts of human conversation they learn from the mistakes we humans make and the prejudice we exhibit
mr lebrun estimated that once in every thousand responses this new breed of chatbot will say something racist or aggressive or otherwise unwanted researchers can fix these problems but that involves gathering more and better data or tweaking the algorithms through process of extreme trial and error
this is problem for services in general more than two years ago software developer noticed that the new google photos service was identifying black people as gorillas google promptly barred the service from identifying gorillas and similar animals and it has yet to provide fix
but identifying and solving problems with conversational systems is harder just because the scope of these systems xe general dialogue xe is so large image recognition is single task conversation is many tasks because it bounces back and forth and each response can affect all the responses to come
for this reason adam coates partner at the venture capital firm khosla ventures who previously oversaw the silicon valley lab attached to the chinese internet giant baidu warns that building truly conversational system is far more difficult than building services that can recognize giraffes say or translate between german and french xe cthere is huge technical barrier here we really don xe know how to build personal assistant xe he said xe cit may not be simply matter of more data we may be missing big idea xe
in the short term many believe conversational systems will be most effective if they are limited to particular tasks like asking for it help or getting medical advice that is still long way from bot that will respond well to anything you say but mr dolan believes these systems will continue to evolve over the next few years provided companies like microsoft can get them in front of the public
xe cwe need people to forgive us when we screw up xe he said xe cpushing forward is going to involve some screw ups xe
chat animations are based on data from microsoft and draw from possible responses for each interaction

stock funds with concentrated portfolios xe or holdings tops xe are supposed to contain only the managers xe best investment ideas
it turns out though that those ideas generally haven xe been good enough to help the funds beat more diversified rivals
in the first quarter and in the one three and five years that ended on march the average such stock fund known as focus fund failed to beat at least half of the funds with the same objective xe large company growth asian smaller companies whatever xe according to morningstar
at our request morningstar examined all actively managed stock funds that had no sales load minimum investment of or less and at least million in assets focus fund was defined as being in the percent of funds with the fewest portfolio holdings meaning it owned fewer stocks than any of the other percent
despite the so so performance of focus funds as group some did exceptionally well and that reveals the good and bad news about them their portfolio concentration can accentuate the gap between the best and worst
xe cconcentration can propel you to greater heights and drive you to greater depths xe said christopher davis senior analyst specializing in equity strategy for morningstar xe ca concentrated fund is harder to own xe
amid the ordinariness or worse there were many apparent standouts greater number of concentrated funds performed in the top percent within their respective investment objectives in each period than would be expected by chance the morningstar data reveals
in the year through march for instance in universe of funds or in the group with the percent fewest holdings should be in the top percent of returns strictly by chance but were
todd rosenbluth director of exchange traded fund and mutual fund research at cfra views the wide performance range among focus funds as silver lining
xe cconcentrated funds put only their best ideas into the portfolio and tend to stick with them xe he said xe cthey can be more volatile as they are driven by smaller number of stocks and tend to be more concentrated in certain sectors xe
that may give any of them chance to beat the market diversified portfolios in contrast may not deviate much from benchmark stock indexes he said and so xe care more likely to lag considerably cheaper vanguard index mutual fund xe
the potential to substantially outperform allows providers of focus funds to charge more money the average focus fund has annual expenses of percent compared with percent for the average actively managed stock fund according to morningstar focus funds also typically have smaller asset bases providing fewer economies of scale
xe cconcentrated funds start off deeper in the expense hole and have deeper expense gap to traverse xe mr davis said xe cif you bet on the right one your upside potential is all that much greater investors choose to make that bet if they choose well the expense ratio doesn xe really matter if they don xe the additional expenses will add insult to injury xe
there have been clear consistent winners among focus funds even if their inherent volatility can cause periodic weakness many names appear on several lists of top concentrated portfolios this year and over one three and five years with seven funds on all four
one of those guinness atkinson global innovators maintains portfolio of about stocks they are often the same ones because the managers like to hold positions for many years
as the fund xe name suggests its managers xe ctry to identify companies that use innovation to drive their growth xe said matthew page one of those managers xe cwe believe that ultimately companies like that should outperform because they xe re smarter and better than their average peers that means higher growth prospects and profits xe
among the themes that appeal to him are big data and machine learning the first refers to the storage processing and analysis of immense sets of related data the second involves developing programs that allow computers to learn from and make predictions about data almost instantaneously skill that will be needed for technologies such as self driving cars
it xe hard to invest in these areas directly mr page said so the portfolio holds stocks in related ones including nvidia which makes graphics processing units fanuc japanese robotics business and infineon german maker of semiconductors for the automotive industry that is expanding into chips for electric and self driving vehicles
the baron fifth avenue growth fund another that appears on all four lists of top performing focus funds favors large companies that sell for less than their intrinsic worth because investors misunderstand their businesses alex umansky the fund xe manager says he adds that there are so few mispricings among these well researched companies that the fund usually holds just to stocks
he keeps most of them for long periods xe xe cour time horizon is forever xe he said xe and accepts price swings that other managers try to avoid by maintaining bigger portfolios
xe cwe think overdiversification has been massively value destructive over the last decade because people are worried about managing volatility xe mr umansky said
the fund xe largest constituent accounting for percent of its assets is hardly obscure xe amazon xe but mr umansky contends that its price is too cheap even at times its earnings for the last four quarters that extravagant valuation is misleading he said because amazon has history of forgoing earnings today by investing in new business lines that will pay off tomorrow
other portfolio holdings include alibaba chinese commerce giant and mastercard and visa which dominate the credit card business mr umansky called mastercard xe cthe digital railroad xe taking financial transactions from paper to the electronic world process that he expects to be larger and more lucrative than investors anticipate
mr rosenbluth recommends the guinness atkinson and baron funds others that he likes and that appear on at least one of the lists of top performing focus funds include columbia select large cap value axa loomis sayles growth and parnassus endeavor
mr davis is fan of the baron and parnassus funds though he is agnostic about focus funds generally
xe cwe haven xe been able to discern real advantage investing in concentrated portfolios but there xe not big disadvantage either xe he said xe cyou should expect to have range of outcomes the more concentrated the portfolio is xe he added xe ceven some of the best performers over the last five years underperform their peers sometimes xe

the relentlessly hyped arrival of autonomous vehicles looms as the greatest disruption in personal transportation since henry ford xe moving assembly line started producing model xe by the millions one word in that statement xe arrival xe is however doing disproportionate amount of work
self driving vehicles despite being the subject of breathless media reports and in automakers xe strategies remain years from being available to private owners scores of companies hold permits to test autonomous cars in california yet even leaders like waymo once google xe self driving project are unwilling to commit to when such vehicles might be appearing in showrooms
even with so many companies testing self driving cars xe million miles since by waymo alone xe the definition of autonomous continues to be murky at least to the public what is available today in driver assistance systems like cadillac xe super cruise or tesla xe enhanced autopilot may offer hands free motoring in some situations but they are far short of what is known as level full automation under the standards of sae international standards setting organization that capability entails operation on any road in any conditions that human driver could handle logically cars built to this standard would have no need for steering wheel or foot pedals
with this radical shift in driving comes questions about the viability of traditional business models based on the private ownership of cars and the dominance of the large carmakers
that upheaval creates opportunities making way for new players many that bring the digital mastery that new generation of driverless cars will demand it looks like silicon valley replay both philosophically and geographically start ups sprout wherever the ground is fertilized with cash already there are giants like waymo lyft and the general motors unit cruise all have outgrown the beginner phase
still reilly brennan general partner at trucks venture capital and lecturer in transportation at stanford university is cautious about how quickly commercial market will develop for new companies
xe cfully unstructured driving by go anywhere cars is long time away xe he said in telephone interview xe cfew start ups actually understood the commitment required to create complete vehicle xe
instead mr brennan suggests autonomy will first come to specialized applications like agriculture mining and fleets dedicated to city delivery routes
the vast amount of data that must be digested by an autonomous car gives rise to another class of participants the suppliers of the underlying technology like analysis tools and sensor systems danny shapiro senior director of automotive at nvidia partner with several prominent autonomous vehicle developers emphasizes the crucial role of such companies in making possible the cars that will be built without pedals or steering wheels
xe cour approach was to build an artificial intelligence brain supercomputer the size of laptop to interpret the data from car xe sensors and build picture of its surroundings xe mr shapiro said
while creeping along in highway traffic jam may not be so demanding detecting distracted pedestrian on city street and plotting safe reaction is far more rigorous
xe cwhen it comes to dealing with those situations there xe no such thing as having too much computing power in the car xe he said
following are some of the start ups that are expected to play role in developing the diverse ecosystem of autonomous vehicles
argo ai based in pittsburgh and the recipient of billion investment from ford motor in argo takes advantage of its close association with the robotics institute of carnegie mellon university argo last year acquired maker of lidar systems princeton lightwave to bring that vital component under its roof bryan salesky argo xe chief executive is veteran of the darpa urban challenge an autonomous vehicle competition
aurora innovation collaborating with hyundai and volkswagen aurora aims to have autonomous vehicles in commercial operation by with founders from google tesla and uber aurora says it plans to remain independent helped by fund raising round early in choosing to partner with automakers rather than being acquired
baidu the chinese language internet search giant baidu recently began two year test project with ford motor to develop level autonomous driving driverless within specific geographic area and under certain weather conditions ford engineers at the nanjing research and engineering center will convert the test vehicles to autonomous operation with baidu xe apollo virtual driver system baidu also expects to have its self driving buses on japanese roads next year
bear flag robotics by focusing on self driving technology for tractors and other farm implements bear flag aims to lower the cost of agriculture and food production while sidestepping the crowd rushing to build vehicles for public roads operating in fleets controlled by single supervisor the autonomous tractors are intended to improve safety
didi labs with the opening last year of research center in mountain view calif didi is extending to the united states its footprint as major ride hailing operation as the owner of uber china and provider of what it says are million rides day it will focus the silicon valley center xe work on based security and intelligent driving technologies
drive ai this company xe concept is to deliver complete ride hailing service to communities that drive ai would run now testing in dallas suburb its orange nissan minivans distinguish themselves by interacting with pedestrians through externally mounted display screens with messages like xe cwaiting xe or xe cexiting xe to replace the communications that human driver might offer
may mobility based in ann arbor mich this start up positions itself as mobility service concentrating on providing fleets of driverless cars for structured environments like downtown business areas corporate campuses and housing developments its approach is to work with local governments to provide transportation in small areas xe about four square miles xe where speeds are limited to miles an hour
roadstar ai completing the link between an autonomous vehicle xe array of sensors and its computer control system this start up coordinates the river of raw data from cameras radar lidar and the like with the processors that analyze it the company works with automotive partners developing driver assist systems and companies creating what are called robotaxis
starsky robotics this is another company that is taking autonomous in slightly different direction and steering clear of cash rich operations like waymo and cruise it will equip freight trucks to be driverless on highways the hub to hub model yet remote controlled by humans for the so called first and last mile of trips
zoox placing its bets on full vehicle development approach zoox is something of an outlier but the company is adamant that only by building fully integrated vehicle rather than adapting autonomous vehicle technology to an existing vehicle can it achieve optimum results the business model is based on zoox xe full ownership of its fleet destined for taxi service in cities founded in the company is looking for chief executive after the departure of its founder tim kentley klay last summer

the sergeant with the mount crested butte police department in colorado appeared and was with my wife and our two young children ages and at lake irwin remote campsite at feet in the rocky mountains when the officer stepped out of his cruiser its blue and red emergency strobes piercing the darkness thought that perhaps neighboring camper had summoned him to silence my dissonant guitar strumming beside the campfire
xe ci xe looking for mr behar xe the sergeant announced my cousin who knew our whereabouts had called the county sheriff who dispatched the sergeant his name was brad phelps and he had navigated dirt road at night through rugged alpine terrain to our location because there was no cell reception where we were after identified myself phelps read from palm size paper notepad xe ci xe sorry to have to tell you that your mother has passed away xe
xe cimpossible xe remember thinking my mother at was competitive tennis player who often went up against and defeated women years younger she was exceptionally fit never smoked and ate like an ascetic thanks to her father who ran produce business and raised his daughter on fruits and vegetables xe cshe was the picture of health xe would hear from friends at the funeral
xe ci was absolutely floored xe her physician milah frownfelter told me recently xe cshe had this tremendous vigor that was completely divorced from the acute process she suffered xe in my mother had coronary calcium scan which uses rays to look for plaque in arteries the results were plugged into risk crunching algorithm that compares patient xe individual health data blood pressure cholesterol age and so on with that of people who are similar demographically and pathologically while my mother had some minor plaque the algorithm calculated her odds of having an xe cevent xe xe heart attack or stroke xe at percent over years hardly alarming for her age she didn xe even meet the threshold at which most doctors would prescribe cholesterol lowering statin drugs frownfelter said
on the day she died she had only mild nausea and clamminess xe ci think xe going to throw up xe she told my father before excusing herself to the bathroom when he checked on her five minutes later she was in the fetal position beside the toilet dead from cardiac arrest cardiologists consulted afterward surmised that she suffered so called widow maker plaque blockage in the left anterior descending artery it xe an invariably fatal heart attack one that disproportionately affects men and can kill an otherwise healthy person almost instantly and with no previous symptoms
as an older father with young kids xe vigilant about my health which led me to get coronary scan in the same procedure my mother underwent was and exercised fanatically my physician thought was crazy and refused to approve the procedure for insurance coverage so paid to medical imaging outfit in boulder where live to get it done had smidgens of plaque in two arteries including the left anterior descending my doctor was surprised but my risk was considered negligible xe percent chance of an event within five years based on similar algorithm developed by the american college of cardiology to the one that had established my mother xe odds xe cyou are already doing everything right xe he assured me and yet my mom had been too
six weeks after my mother xe death visited nelson trujillo prominent cardiologist in boulder coronary scans show only hard plaque he explained they don xe reveal whether it xe softening and ready to rupture xe clike big pimple xe in his words if it pops its fragments could clog an artery which would be dangerous if not lethal coronary angiogram done with ct scanner can detect soft plaque but because ct scan is expensive and exposes the patient to radiation it xe rarely performed on someone whose probability of having heart attack is statistically low
trujillo had recommendation privately held biotech company in town called somalogic was conducting trial for new blood screening process to gauge cardiovascular health and trujillo happened to be leading the study xe cyou are the perfect candidate xe he declared with kidlike enthusiasm cardiologists make clinical decisions based on statistical factors gleaned from broad population studies xe cwe xe re always comparing you to big groups of people xe trujillo told me xe cthe problem is we know that sometimes we xe re wrong we have miss rate xe those six guys out of hundred who we say are but who are not wanted to know who those six people were xe
the test promised to search my blood for nine proteins associated with cardiovascular health there are or so known proteins in the human proteome as the collective sum of proteins in any organism is called because it can signal when something is amiss inside body the proteome has the potential to serve as diagnostic system xe sort of like the ones in modern cars that alert mechanics when fuel injector is plugged or timing belt needs replacing the somalogic screen wouldn xe merely compare my health stats with those of other men like me it would take snapshot of what was happening inside my body at that moment xe cit xe not odds based on people who look like you xe trujillo told me xe cit xe odds based on you specifically xe
proteomics or the study of proteins has long offered the ability to identify many biological processes but until recently the sheer number of proteins and the complexity of their interactions made screenings impractical if not impossible now with the advent of more powerful computers and form of artificial intelligence called machine learning medical experts are imagining future where proteomics will realize its power to tell us to an incredible degree what xe transpiring inside our bodies as omid farokhzad professor and physician recently at harvard medical school puts it xe cwe xe ll be able to diagnose diseases such as cancers and alzheimer xe years before symptoms xe
for physician like trujillo who is still working with somalogic to give the protein test to patients the promise of proteomics is already here xe ci used to say to somebody like your mom xe you don xe have much heart disease you don xe need anything xe but that was couldn xe reassure her one way or the other xe he said xe cthis is where proteomics comes in xe and where it xe fundamentally different than anything else we have xe proteomics might have saved her life xe and it may yet save mine
genes tend to get more attention but proteins might really deserve the limelight as the workhorses in the human body proteins play role in nearly all of its biological processes they make antibodies to battle infections they grow bone and muscle and convert what you eat into nutrients proteins are constructed inside cells from building blocks called amino acids humans have commonly occurring amino acids we produce naturally and obtain nine more from what we eat which is why high protein foods are essential to our diet the blueprints for proteins are stored inside genes which contain dna and rna rna is like courier delivering the instructions from genes to cells for making proteins from specified assortments of amino acids
our proteins are in constant flux they can appear and disappear or shift in concentration in response to our external environment or internal physiology our proteome reacts to what we eat when we sleep how we exercise the smoke we inhale the alcohol we drink my proteins look different after run than they do before the race they change when get the flu they are altered by stress and emotions
researchers are now learning that diseases have their own unique proteomic patterns an ailment like colon cancer might involve interactions with hundreds of proteins stephen williams the chief medical officer of somalogic told me about recent experiment that turned up at least proteins associated with diabetes
proteins and genes have very different things to say about our health genes are static we live and die with the same set we xe re born with about in the human genome that make proteins certain diseases are linked directly to genes like those for breast cancer and alzheimer xe but genes can inform us only of our odds if my dna resembles that of other men who have prostate cancer that means have greater risk of suffering similar fate my genes can xe tell me that actually have cancer or that will however only that have predisposition for it
proteins can confirm an illness is underway and they often appear in our blood long before we feel sick xe months or years before symptoms when many diseases are still curable xe cin the vast majority of cases it xe the proteins we can measure before anything else xe says joshua labaer who founded the harvard institute of proteomics and now directs the biodesign institute at arizona state university where he is professor
this kind of information is invaluable to doctors who want to know exactly what is going wrong in real time not what might happen in the future xe and it xe also why they haven xe learned as much from genomics as they had originally hoped xe cwe xe ve looked lot at genes in the past years xe says jon heimer the chief executive of olink proteomics biotech firm based in uppsala sweden that sells protein panels to scan for ailments ranging from organ damage to inflammation xe cbut it makes more sense to look at proteins because they are the biological machinery of human beings xe
today physicians rely largely on pattern recognition to make clinical diagnoses they match observed symptoms with associated ailments but there xe pitfall to this approach xe symptoms are sometimes absent our bodies can function well when they xe re ill even gravely so it xe an evolutionary survival mechanism that prevented my mother xe heart from divulging any clues to its infirmity until it failed
in general we don xe go to the doctor until we xe re feeling lousy xe persistent cough say or throbbing headache but there are deadly conditions that don xe always exhibit conspicuous signs cardiovascular disease stroke cancer alzheimer xe diabetes and kidney dysfunction xe six of the top things that kill people in the united states accounting for million deaths annually according to the centers for disease control and prevention xe can all manifest without symptoms but proteins often show up first
hundreds of ailments like strep throat flu and among others are already diagnosed through single protein tests the prostate specific antigen protein or can indicate if man has prostate cancer the blood drawn at your annual physical is analyzed for variety of its proteins like hemoglobin and lipoproteins which flag cholesterol levels perhaps the most common and reliable test is the pregnancy pee stick which measures human chorionic gonadotropin or hcg hormonal protein produced by the placenta
but complex disease fingerprints with swarms of proteins are exceptionally difficult and time consuming to spot using conventional xe cwet lab xe methods xe cto your eyes and my eyes we won xe catch them xe says farokhzad who helped start seer biotech firm in to spin off his academic research into marketable protein tests xe cbut to sophisticated machine learning algorithms these things pop out like daylight xe once algorithms have identified these fingerprints researchers can use them to develop tests like the one took for my heart
xe cdiagnostic medicine has always been about proteins xe says philip ma seer xe president and chief business officer xe call proteomics is allowing you to do is to look at them in bunches instead of one at time xe
larry gold founder of somalogic has wispy white hair and bushy mustache making him look bit like mark twain xe cwe got our unicorn status xe he said when we met at his office in june modeling knit cap with rainbow banded horn protruding from its crown xe ci guess that xe kind of big deal xe the designation is given to privately held companies valued at more than billion he was wearing bluejeans and long sleeve black shirt and he has more identical ones that he keeps stacked in drawer and in regular rotation xe ci don xe care what look like xe gold said xe cbut have dress up outfit somewhere in my closet for raising money xe
gold who is moved to boulder after securing professorship at the university of colorado few years after earning ph in biochemistry from the university of connecticut he ran his own lab xe now adjacent to the square foot gold biosciences building xe and still teaches there occasionally during the one of his graduate students was scientist named craig tuerk currently biochemistry professor at morehead state university in kentucky at the time there were several available methods to determine the presence of single type of protein among them the use of antibodies which gold and tuerk were familiar with protein of interest can be injected into an animal like mouse whereupon its immune system will make antibodies to fight the invading molecule these xe cbinding antibodies xe attach themselves like lego bricks to the protein which becomes easier to spot as result the mouse antibodies are subsequently harvested for research and can be used to develop diagnostic screenings
in four years after joining gold xe lab tuerk was conducting research for his ph thesis on viral dna while experimenting with type of virus that infects bacteria tuerk noticed that strands from the virus xe rna had somehow bound themselves to specific proteins dna and rna are nucleic acids what tuerk had discovered accidentally was way to identify immense numbers of proteins at once with nucleic acids instead of antibodies using molecule found on both dna and rna called an aptamer it was momentous breakthrough xe cwe didn xe start dancing because we were being science types xe gold said they did however immediately begin drafting patent which gold stayed up all night to write the next evening biotech entrepreneur named david brunel invited gold over for thanksgiving dinner xe ci fell asleep on the floor of david xe house xe gold said xe cpeople were walking over me xe
brunel later invested in somalogic and gold has put at least million of his own money into the firm made from the sale of two companies he founded previously at his venture before somalogic during the early gold helped develop the first approved aptamer derived medication for macular degeneration which had roughly million in sales in its first year on the market but even then gold had bigger plans for aptamers xe to use them to analyze proteins on an unprecedented scale he would glean patterns from the data that could diagnose diseases it was possible to do the same thing with antibodies but that would require luck and patience like trying to catalog every fish in the ocean with net that captured only single species at time and even then in those years xe right about the time when marc wilkins graduate student at macquarie university in australia coined the word xe cproteomics xe xe it might have taken months for researchers to make sense of the voluminous data proteins are folded into intricate three dimensional structures mapping one was challenging enough mapping thousands was all but unmanageable
xe cantibodies are used mostly to measure one protein xe gold said xe cthey would never scale to what thought proteomics would have to do to make it significant in health care xe xe that is generate information quickly and cheaply enough to be practical for doctors to use in daily clinical practice xe ci had this idea that if you measured enough proteins you xe be able to get insights into human biology that were hard to get any other way xe
somascan is the manifestation of his vision it xe twofold technology platform combining machine learning with chemical process to isolate proteins from single drop of blood williams says this scan has found fingerprint like patterns for more than diseases including lung and pancreatic cancer both notorious for their dismal survival rates
what these fingerprints convey can be grouped into three categories probability your odds of getting sick current state you xe re already sick but don xe know it and trajectory how soon you xe ll get worse xe cthere are patterns that do each of these jobs xe williams told me adding that his ultimate goal is to find all these patterns for any condition in single scan and also measure whether they change in response to lifestyle improvements or medication
proteomics has faced something of chicken or egg dilemma doctors won xe embrace the technology until they are sure that protein screenings provide reliable results but improving reliability is largely contingent on widespread adoption put another way the greater the number of patients who are tested the more accurate the fingerprints become
before it had patients whose proteins it could analyze somalogic began building its disease database with biobanks which store frozen blood and tissue for research using specimens from these repositories xe the ones at the national institutes of health and many research hospitals are made accessible to scientists xe the company began to hone its machine learning algorithm training it to search for key protein configurations donors to biobanks are anonymous but their health data is not by cross indexing newly identified protein patterns with medical histories researchers might find new disease fingerprint in subset of donors who had liver cancer for example somalogic can duplicate or confirm these findings by scanning different samples and using different biobanks which the company is doing now
ideally somalogic would run blinded trials the gold standard for validating new medical drugs and diagnostics but there is an ethical obstacle to doing so somalogic typically focuses on single disease when it xe evaluating disease fingerprint in real world setting which is what gold enlisted trujillo to do with the heart test back in for blinded trial trujillo would have had to randomly select some of his patients with high risk fingerprint and then xe without informing them of the looming threat xe wait to see if they had heart attack
trujillo xe work is limited to his patient pool about people so far but somalogic xe continuing studies typically entail thousands of patients whose proteomes are sampled and tracked longitudinally in lieu of trial somalogic is able to confirm data retrospectively over the span of say lung cancer study some people in the cohort will get other ailments if one of those subjects in the lung cancer study develops diabetes for instance somalogic can check whether she carried the fingerprint for that disease when her blood was drawn years earlier
once fingerprint is found it can still need refining the cardiovascular test from somalogic intrigued robert gerszten the chief of cardiovascular medicine at boston xe beth israel deaconess medical center and also harvard medical school professor gerszten had patients with condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy which causes the heart muscle to thicken abnormally it can be treated by medically inducing heart attack which thins the affected tissue xe cit xe one of the few examples where you know the person is going to have big heart attack xe gerszten says he sampled blood from his patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy both before and after the procedure as well as from people who xe had ordinary heart attacks
not only did gerszten find proteins that matched with those that somalogic had identified but he also came across ones never previously tied to cardiovascular health xe cwe found dozens and dozens of new proteins that no one had discovered xe he says while gerszten had helped validate that protein screening panels could presage heart attacks he also illustrated that the underlying biology was remarkably more complicated
other factors also hinder proteomic investigation one is statistical anomaly known as xe coverfitting xe which happens when trying to match disease that involves scads of proteins with too few patients as labaer puts it xe cthere is chance you xe re going to find set of markers that look real but are not xe another is the tendency of proteins to interact with other molecules and change after they xe re formed process known as post translational modification xe cthere is landscape of these modifications xe real zoo of molecules xe most of which we don xe understand what their effect is xe says steven carr senior director of proteomics at the broad institute of and harvard scientists don xe always know whether it xe the actual proteins or the modified ones that are associated with trouble nor can they be sure if blood test is necessarily distinguishing between these two protein structures xe one of which may be malicious and the other benign xe or even capable of detecting certain modified proteins at all xe cnot everyone who has these proteins might get that disease xe carr says xe cand some who have the disease might not have that particular form of proteins xe
somalogic xe hunt for proteins starts in sparse room at its headquarters in eight foot tall upright freezers set to minus degrees celsius they are filled with small trays holding dozens of inch long plastic tubes each containing drop of serum the clear liquid remaining after clotting compounds are removed from blood at any given time there are approximately samples on site stored in freezers technicians oversee robotic arms programmed to add aptamers to the samples with fluorescent light refracting tag somalogic has engineered aptamers and rechristened them somamers after more robotic juggling the serum solution from the tubes is placed onto glass slides and an imaging device measures the light intensity passing through the fluorescent substance to assess which proteins are present and in what concentrations it xe here that the biological information is converted into digital data
it takes hours to acquire protein data from one sample and the lab processes about day the raw data xe totaling some four million protein measurements every hours xe is fed into machine learning algorithms which are revised constantly based on the various disease patterns they xe re interested in investigating
while allocating most resources to the big three xe cancer heart disease and diabetes xe somalogic also is delving into realms that traditionally haven xe been studied with proteomics such as smoking social deprivation excessive alcohol consumption and fitness there are hundreds of proteins common among tobacco smokers which williams speculates could be used to expose those suspected of smoking but who deny it xe cit xe the worst lifestyle health risk you can get xe he says xe cbut people lie about it xe
somalogic will commence its first large scale beta test this year collaborating with the leeds center for personalized medicine and health in england williams told me that the project is starting with diabetes trial with other diseases to follow more than one third of british residents are prediabetic xe meaning that they are not exhibiting symptoms but are at risk of developing the disease xe cwe don xe want those people to become diabetic xe williams says xe cbut we don xe really know who is susceptible xe
somalogic will collect blood samples from patients in leeds and then zero in on those whose protein fingerprints suggest that diabetes is imminent the company recently set up square foot lab in oxford to process samples physicians in turn will instruct patients in strategies that have proved to pre empt the need for diabetic medication like exercise weight loss and nutrition counseling xe cthe point is that this information may motivate people straightaway xe williams says
gold wants somascan to eventually evolve into something he calls the xe cwellness chip xe do it all protein screening to replace annual physicals which several studies have suggested rarely benefit health in may at an annual health care and science symposium that gold hosts at the university of colorado somalogic xe chief corporate strategist mark messenbaugh displayed slide during his lecture that showed toilet equipped with somascan chip and captioned xe cour ultimate goal xe somawhiz xe he wasn xe joking williams confirmed later that the company is adapting its technology for xe ca noninvasive home collected urine test xe to look for many of the same disease fingerprints found by somascan
eventually somalogic hopes to sell its blood and urine scans directly to consumers for as little as per test gold says but there is fear percolating among some scientists and health care providers about what patients will do with the data will they demand treatment from their doctors based solely on proteomic scan more important will their doctors comply
xe cthere are consequences to these measurements xe carr says xe cthere are interventions taken drugs people are put on additional testing that costs money and it raises the anxiety level of those being tested so you damn well better be sure you xe re measuring what you say you xe re measuring xe and know that it matters xe before you employ it in clinical setting xe
when my results came back from somalogic month after my blood was drawn they told me that had an percent chance of experiencing cardiac event within five years xe more than three times as high as what the coronary calcium scan and associated algorithm had forecast trujillo insisted that immediately start taking statin drug to halt further plaque buildup
because proteins react to external inputs trujillo asked everyone who got the heart screening to redo it one year later from what we know about the proteome any actions taken to prevent heart attack xe dietary improvements exercise medications xe should nudge the odds lower for now it xe too early to draw conclusions from trujillo xe follow up data but he says xe cthe results have really allowed me to personalize care they have motivated people to change their lifestyle or take medication xe
told gold that my anniversary date for the heart test was approaching and that would soon be providing second blood sample to trujillo he warned me that my risk might not fall precipitously as evolving proteomic research is showing that cardiovascular disease like so many other ailments is more intricate biological puzzle than once thought the results from my second test confirmed as much did not drop single percentage point had spent year on statins mostly eliminated red meat from my diet and added high intensity interval training to my workouts also did five day fast that trujillo recommended for reducing inflammation xe well known contributor to heart disease xe and in the course of it lost eight pounds none of it appeared to help
trujillo was untroubled xe cmy work has led to page of questions as it relates to how to use this test going forward xe he said xe cis it god xe word not even close it xe just part of the armamentarium xe trujillo reckoned that fathoming the proteome might spawn new mysteries while solving others
gold echoed similar sentiment when we talked xe cwe know more about the proteome here than anyone on earth and we think it xe treasure trove of understanding human biology xe he said xe cbut won xe lie about it the science is hard xe harder than thought xe

san francisco xe nearly year after accusing uber of stealing its driverless car technology waymo agreed on friday to settle closely watched lawsuit filed against the ride hailing company
now for waymo which grew out of google xe seminal autonomous vehicle project and is nearly decade into an effort that aims to change the very nature of transportation much bigger fight looms outside the courtroom
waymo xe competition extends well beyond uber xe and good part of that competition is directed by engineers it used to employ much of the artificial intelligence technology that has come out of waymo xe work and from research run by google xe parent company alphabet is now available from other sources making it easier for companies even start ups to compete
xe cwaymo may have technical advantage xe said jason doran who helped run the delivery service sidecar and joined general motors when the carmaker acquired the start up xe cbut they have to figure out business model xe
it is not uncommon for tech pioneer to miss out on becoming the company that cashes in on the technology it has been working on the industry is littered with stories of people with great idea that someone else turned into great business
the concept for the databases used by most of the world xe big corporations came out of ibm but another company oracle turned that software into big business researchers at the silicon valley lab of xerox famously pioneered the technology that went into many of apple xe computers
and executives at alphabet would certainly remember that google was hardly the first internet search engine it was just better than anything that came before it
other than an ownership stake in uber worth about million that came with settling the lawsuit waymo has not made substantial money from those years of research
that is worth noting because so many of the companies competing with waymo are relying on the brainpower of its former employees dave ferguson former waymo engineer oversees start up called nuro which is building driverless car for shipping and delivering goods chris urmson longtime waymo engineer is the chief executive of start up called aurora brian salesky third waymo engineer is now at argo an autonomous vehicle start up backed by billion in funding from ford motor
with that brain drain in mind the uber lawsuit can also be seen as fight against former google engineer anthony levandowski who also took his services elsewhere xe first to otto start up he created and then to uber just six months later
the question was whether he took trade secrets with him waymo accused uber of conspiring with mr levandowski to steal its trade secrets and feed them into driverless car project already underway inside the ride hailing company with friday xe settlement uber has promised that its cars will operate without the help of waymo xe intellectual property
there are other issues for waymo unlike ford general motors or toyota waymo does not manufacture and sell cars unlike uber and lyft it does not operate vast ride hailing services where it could readily deploy vehicles equipped with its own self driving technology
as the big automakers and the ride hailing companies accelerate their self driving projects waymo may need to find way of inserting itself into these efforts or to build and operate new self driving service of its own
xe cthere xe the self driving tech but you also have to scale that tech and you have to offer service that people really want to use xe mr ferguson said xe cyou have to get all of that right xe
the competition still tips its hat to waymo and agrees that after nine years of work on autonomous vehicles it leads the technology race but the gap is closing recent changes in the way driverless cars are built and the rise of readily available hardware that can help these vehicles understand and respond to what is happening around them have made it easier to compete
waymo executives were not available for interviews for this article john krafcik waymo xe chief executive is scheduled to speak on monday evening at conference on artificial intelligence hosted by the new york times
xe cwaymo has the partnerships and technology needed to launch the world xe first self driving service this year xe waymo spokesman said in statement pointing to how the company has fully self driving cars on some public roads has secured vehicles from fiat chrysler and has partnered with avis autonation lyft and others xe cafter years of research and development waymo is now focused on operations and deployment xe
when waymo was still operating under google its head start in this race was obvious google began testing its self driving prototypes on public roads in and this is what set off so many other efforts
in the years since the technology that drives these vehicles has changed in enormous ways thanks to the rise of xe neural networks xe which are complex systems that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data by analyzing thousands of images neural network can for example learn to identify pedestrian using these methods engineers can build and improve self driving cars at far more rapid pace
xe cthis is profoundly important xe said mr urmson of aurora which is supplying self driving technology to volkswagen audi and hyundai xe cwe can build on top of that revolution xe
in google was among the first companies to build research lab dedicated to these rapidly evolving techniques and number of researchers from this lab eventually moved on to the google self driving car project google has also built the vast network of specialized hardware needed to drive this kind of xe cmachine learning xe even building new computer chip suited to the task
these techniques are spreading across the industry and anyone can immediately tap into enormous amounts of computing power through cloud services operated by the likes of amazon microsoft and yes google
many car manufacturers believe they will eventually catch up because they can deploy so many more cars equipped with sensors that can record real world activity
xe cwhat the car companies have is the potential to harvest more data than anyone else xe gill pratt chief executive of the toyota research institute the silicon valley research and development operation created by the japanese car company said in an interview last fall xe cit may be this that matters the most xe
waymo is unlikely to manufacture its own cars but it may end up running its own self driving service alphabet recently led billion investment in lyft and it could deploy its driverless cars through this existing ride hailing option waymo is also running private trial of its cars near phoenix and it has long hinted that it will offer some sort of undefined public service in the area
operating this kind of service is no small thing and some question whether waymo is equipped to do so xe cthis is where the ubers and the lyfts have an advantage xe mr ferguson said
he cautioned that the departures from waymo may have an unintended consequence for the entire industry many smart people are needed in the same place to figure things out
xe cyou need to have lot of the best minds together to solve it xe he said xe cone of my fears is that we have spread the field little thin as result we have actually slowed down the speed with which we can solve this problem xe

apple recently became trillion company fueled partly by the growth from its iphone in contrast its top competitor in smartphones samsung has been dealing with slowing revenue from its signature galaxy smartphone
to prompt more sales samsung on thursday unveiled the galaxy note its latest big screen smartphone also known as xe cphablet xe which comes equipped with digital pen like apple xe top selling iphone the galaxy note costs about it arrives in stores on aug
samsung introduced the new note few weeks earlier than it normally would as way to drum up awareness for the device
for phone this pricey the new features of the note are hardly cutting edge samsung highlighted the galaxy note xe exceptionally large battery which it said would let people talk text and play games all day the company also emphasized faster speeds and the device xe larger inch screen the last galaxy note measured diagonal inches
the changes may not be enough to return samsung to healthy growth in smartphones some analysts said
xe ci don xe see the note helping tremendously xe said carolina milanesi technology analyst for creative strategies she added that the galaxy note has typically been smaller seller compared to samsung xe galaxy smartphones so the note is unlikely to make meaningful impact on the company xe profit
the slowing growth of samsung still the world xe top handset maker by volume is reflection of saturated market many people who want smartphone already have one and people are upgrading to new models more slowly than they used to
even apple which brought in more than billion in profit last quarter saw its iphone sales increase only percent from year earlier yet apple still increased its iphone revenue substantially by getting people to pay about percent more for iphones on average thanks largely to the introduction of the pricier iphone
samsung is betting on making bigger technology innovations in the future the south korean company this week said it would invest more than billion over the next three years in areas including artificial intelligence
mark newman an analyst for sanford bernstein in hong kong said samsung was well positioned to be market leader in
xe con the hardware side for there xe no one that xe stronger than samsung xe he said xe cthe key to is memory and they are the biggest memory semiconductor maker in the world by far xe

san francisco xe arizona officials saw opportunity when uber and other companies began testing driverless cars few years ago promising to keep oversight light they invited the companies to test their robotic vehicles on the state xe roads
then on sunday night an autonomous car operated by uber xe and with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel xe struck and killed woman on street in tempe ariz it was believed to be the first pedestrian death associated with self driving technology the company quickly suspended testing in tempe as well as in pittsburgh san francisco and toronto
the death of woman who was struck by an autonomous car operated by uber is believed to be the first pedestrian fatality associated with self driving technology newly released video offers clues about what happened
the accident was reminder that self driving technology is still in the experimental stage and governments are still trying to figure out how to regulate it
uber waymo and long list of tech companies and automakers have begun to expand testing of their self driving vehicles in cities around the country the companies say the cars will be safer than regular cars simply because they take easily distracted humans out of the driving equation but the technology is still only about decade old and just now starting to experience the unpredictable situations that drivers can face
it was not yet clear if the crash in arizona will lead other companies or state regulators to slow the rollout of self driving vehicles on public roads
much of the testing of autonomous cars has taken place in piecemeal regulatory environment some states like arizona have taken lenient approach to regulation arizona officials wanted to lure companies working on self driving technology out of neighboring california where regulators had been less receptive
read more on how arizona became destination for self driving car tests
but regulators in california and elsewhere have become more accommodating lately in april california is expected to follow arizona xe lead and allow companies to test cars without person in the driver xe seat
federal policymakers have also considered lighter touch senate bill if passed would free autonomous car makers from some existing safety standards and pre empt states from creating their own vehicle safety laws similar legislation has been passed in the house the senate version has passed committee vote but hasn xe reached full floor vote
xe cthis tragic incident makes clear that autonomous vehicle technology has long way to go before it is truly safe for the passengers pedestrians and drivers who share america xe roads xe said senator richard blumenthal democrat of connecticut
the uber car volvo xc sport utility vehicle outfitted with the company xe sensing system was in autonomous mode with human safety driver at the wheel but carrying no passengers when it struck elaine herzberg year old woman on sunday around
sgt ronald elcock tempe police spokesman said during news conference that preliminary investigation showed that the vehicle was moving around miles per hour when it struck ms herzberg who was walking with her bicycle on the street he said it did not appear as though the car had slowed down before impact and that the uber safety driver had shown no signs of impairment the weather was clear and dry
uber said it would work with the police
xe cour hearts go out to the victim xe family xe an uber spokeswoman sarah abboud said in statement xe cwe are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident xe
tempe with its dry weather and wide roads was considered an ideal place to test autonomous vehicles in arizona officials declared the state regulation free zone in order to attract testing operations from companies like uber waymo and lyft
xe cwe needed our message to uber lyft and other entrepreneurs in silicon valley to be that arizona was open to new ideas xe doug ducey arizona xe governor said in an interview in june
using an executive order mr ducey opened the state to testing of autonomous vehicles that had safety drivers at the wheel ready to take over in an emergency he updated that mandate earlier this month to allow testing of unmanned self driving cars noting that xe cbusiness friendly and low regulatory environment xe had helped the state xe economy
even when an uber self driving car and another vehicle collided in tempe in march city police and mr ducey said that extra safety regulations weren xe necessary the other driver was at fault not the self driving vehicle
but on monday mark mitchell tempe xe mayor called uber xe decision to suspend autonomous vehicle testing xe cresponsible step xe and cautioned people from drawing conclusions prematurely daniel scarpinato spokesman for mr ducey said the updated order from the governor xe cprovides enhanced enforcement measures and clarity on responsibility in these accidents xe
in california where testing without backup driver was just weeks away from being permitted jessica gonzalez spokeswoman for the state department of motor vehicles said officials were in the process of gathering more information about the tempe crash waymo lyft and cruise an autonomous vehicle company owned by general motors did not respond to requests for comment
in news release the national transportation safety board said it was sending team of four investigators to examine xe cthe vehicle xe interaction with the environment other vehicles and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and bicyclists xe
since late last year waymo the self driving car unit of google xe parent company alphabet has been using cars without human in the driver xe seat to pick up and drop off passengers in arizona
most testing of driverless cars occurs with safety driver in the front seat who is available to take over if something goes wrong it can be challenging however to take control of fast moving vehicle
california requires companies to report the number of instances when human drivers are forced to take over for the autonomous vehicle called xe cdisengagements xe
between december and november waymo xe self driving cars drove about miles and human drivers retook the wheel times xe an average of about miles between every disengagement uber has not been testing its self driving cars long enough in california to be required to release its disengagement numbers
researchers working on autonomous technology have struggled with how to teach the systems to adjust for unpredictable human driving or behavior still most researchers believe self driving cars will ultimately be more safe than their human counterparts
in people died in traffic related accidents in the united states according to the national highway traffic safety administration that amounts to fatalities per million vehicle miles traveled in
waymo which has been testing autonomous vehicles on public roads since when it was google xe self driving car project has said its cars have driven more than million miles while uber xe cars have covered million miles
in man driving his tesla using autopilot the car company xe self driving feature died on state highway in florida when his car crashed into tractor trailer that was crossing the road federal regulators later ruled there were no defects in the system to cause the accident
but the crash in tempe will draw attention among the general public to self driving cars said michael bennett an associate research professor at arizona state university who has been looking into how people respond to driverless cars and artificial intelligence
xe cwe xe ve imagined an event like this as huge inflection point for the technology and the companies advocating for it xe he said xe cthey xe re going to have to do lot to prove that the technology is safe xe

visual tour of the world xe most important tech conference offers window into the year xe trends including next generation wireless networks and the invasion of
by brian chen
las vegas xe the show must go on
that sentiment couldn xe have been stronger this week at ces the largest consumer electronics convention in the country the conference which brought more than people to las vegas was reminder of what the tech industry is best at being optimistic about itself
who cares about the abysmal stock market and growing fears that we are sliding into recession check out these virtual reality headsets self driving cars and big screen tvs
filippo yacob tech entrepreneur who attended was blas xc xa about the state of the market xe cthe speed of progress and innovation happens at such rapid pace that it xe not like it pulses with the stock market xe said mr yacob whose company primo toys makes tech products for children xe cit xe more like bullet train xe
this year xe event was also slightly larger than the last with more than exhibitors sprawled across million square feet the conference offered peek at the year xe hottest tech trends including artificially intelligent virtual assistants next generation wireless networks and connected cars
and companies unveiled thousands of products google and amazon showed car accessories alarm clocks and speakers that can be controlled with their virtual assistants by speaking commands like xe chey google what xe the weather today xe or xe calexa what xe my sports update xe
lg lured attendees into its giant booth with televisions that can be rolled up as if they were yoga mats
wireless carriers and chip makers highlighted the next generation cellular network arriving this year in small number of cities with data speeds so zippy that devices can download an entire movie in seconds
the most surprising news came when host of tech companies announced they were working with apple to bring some of the company xe content and virtual assistant capabilities to their devices
vizio the tv maker said its newer tvs would work with airplay an apple software feature for streaming video and audio content from an iphone or mac to television screen people will be able to speak to siri on their iphones to play content they had purchased from itunes on the vizio tvs samsung sony and lg announced similar partnerships with apple
in the past airplay and itunes videos were mostly tied to apple made hardware like the apple tv set top box their expansion to third parties underlines apple xe ambition to expand the revenue it generates from its internet content and services that xe especially important now that sales of apple xe cash cow the iphone are slowing this month the company reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in years
the move is also notable because it illustrates an unusual willingness by apple to open its technology to other companies including competitors like samsung
in statement provided by samsung eddy cue apple xe head of internet software and services said that with the expansion of itunes and airplay xe ciphone ipad and mac users have yet another way to enjoy all their favorite content on the biggest screen in their home xe
front and center at ces was the battle between virtual assistants xe namely amazon xe alexa and google xe assistant google erected an enormous outdoor booth to show off the multitude of devices that now work with assistant including smart watches speakers and displays the company said billion devices now work with its assistant up from million last year google wants to make the assistant the focal point of consumer xe life in the home in the car and on mobile devices
xe cwhen walk down the aisle at home depot will all the devices might buy work with the assistant xe nick fox google executive who oversees assistant said of items like smoke detectors and thermostats xe cthe answer is yes xe
amazon also had large presence at the show it filled large conference room at the venetian hotel with dozens of products that work with alexa including an audi car motorcycle helmet and stereo system
the battle among virtual assistants is shaping up to be very different from past platform wars between tech companies because consumers will have more choices many of the smart gadgets at ces worked with multiple virtual assistants
aaron emigh chief executive of brilliant which makes smart home products that work with alexa google assistant and siri said it was critical for virtual assistants to work together not against one another because the smart home was already too complex with products like light switches thermostats and cameras coming from different brands
xe cthe more technology and the more different vendors that get put in your home the more important that it all works together xe he said
car manufacturers like mercedes benz and bmw showed off concepts of autonomous vehicles powered by artificial intelligence and wireless connections but consumers won xe be able to buy self driving vehicles from dealership anytime soon in part because companies still need much more data on how people drive cars smarter cars with features like built in voice assistants to help people use maps play music or get sports update without taking their eyes off the road are available now however
if the economy does cool off sales of cutting edge gadgets will drop fast but that didn xe faze people here none of the ces attendees spoke to expressed concern
matt strauss who oversees comcast xe xfinity internet and cable service was especially bullish about the year ahead he said just about everything announced at ces required an internet connection so that xe the last thing that people would cut off
xe cit xe become like oxygen xe he said
brian chen is the lead consumer technology writer he reviews products and writes tech fix column about solving tech related problems before joining the times in he reported on apple and the wireless industry for wired bxchen

san francisco xe google xe efforts to build delivery drones and internet beaming balloons are no longer just science projects
both ventures are becoming their own independent businesses within alphabet the technology conglomerate that owns google and now other units alphabet said on wednesday their so called graduation from alphabet xe research lab means the delivery drone and balloon internet teams may now be on path to soon offer commercial services and earn revenue
xe cthe seemingly impossible can actually be possible xe astro teller the head of said in blog post xe ctoday unlike when they started as projects loon and wing seem long way from crazy xe
the delivery drone unit named wing has built pound drones with fixed wings for gliding to destinations and rotors for hovering over homes while winching down deliveries wing tested the aircraft in australia last year delivering burritos and medicine to customers who ordered the items on mobile app
wing has struggled to perfect its technology since it began in at one point scrapping its entire design but its new status suggests the team is satisfied with its progress technical hurdles remain such as delivering in urban areas though regulations may pose bigger challenge the federal aviation administration is slowly authorizing tests of drone deliveries in the united states including future pilot program with wing in virginia
wing is also betting it can make business out of regulators xe strict requirements for drones the company is developing software that routes unmanned aircraft in the sky sort of automated air traffic control for drones
alphabet xe other new unit called loon is building high altitude balloons that deliver internet connections to rural or disaster stricken areas loon xe huge balloons navigate wind currents in the stratosphere roughly miles above ground to cluster around areas with poor connectivity loon works with local telecommunications companies to improve cell service on the ground acting as sort of floating temporary cell tower
loon began in inside its balloons have since traveled more than million miles delivering internet from brazil to new zealand last year loon beamed connections to peru after floods there and puerto rico after hurricane maria
although loon and wing are now stand alone units inside alphabet it still may be years before they become full fledged businesses if ever google xe self driving car project was spun out of in to become waymo but it still focuses on small pilots of its technology loon xe and wing xe graduations also will likely bring increased scrutiny of their finances and expectations for their progress from alphabet xe executives

you xe ve probably heard that we xe re in the midst of an revolution we xe re told that machine intelligence is progressing at an astounding rate powered by xe cdeep learning xe algorithms that use huge amounts of data to train complicated programs known as xe cneural networks xe
today xe programs can recognize faces and transcribe spoken sentences we have programs that can spot subtle financial fraud find relevant web pages in response to ambiguous queries map the best driving route to almost any destination beat human grandmasters at chess and go and translate between hundreds of languages what xe more we xe ve been promised that self driving cars automated cancer diagnoses housecleaning robots and even automated scientific discovery are on the verge of becoming mainstream
the facebook founder mark zuckerberg recently declared that over the next five to years the company will push its to xe cget better than human level at all of the primary human senses vision hearing language general cognition xe shane legg chief scientist of google xe deepmind group predicted that xe chuman level will be passed in the mid xe
as someone who has worked in for decades xe ve witnessed the failure of similar predictions of imminent human level and xe certain these latest forecasts will fall short as well the challenge of creating humanlike intelligence in machines remains greatly underestimated today xe systems sorely lack the essence of human intelligence understanding the situations we experience being able to grasp their meaning the mathematician and philosopher gian carlo rota famously asked xe ci wonder whether or when will ever crash the barrier of meaning xe to me this is still the most important question
the lack of humanlike understanding in machines is underscored by recent cracks that have appeared in the foundations of modern while today xe programs are much more impressive than the systems we had or years ago series of research studies have shown that deep learning systems can be unreliable in decidedly unhumanlike ways
xe ll give few examples
xe cthe bareheaded man needed hat xe is transcribed by my phone xe speech recognition program as xe cthe bear headed man needed hat xe google translate renders xe ci put the pig in the pen xe into french as xe cje mets le cochon dans le stylo xe mistranslating xe cpen xe in the sense of writing instrument
programs that xe cread xe documents and answer questions about them can easily be fooled into giving wrong answers when short irrelevant snippets of text are appended to the document similarly programs that recognize faces and objects lauded as major triumph of deep learning can fail dramatically when their input is modified even in modest ways by certain types of lighting image filtering and other alterations that do not affect humans xe recognition abilities in the slightest
one recent study showed that adding small amounts of xe cnoise xe to face image can seriously harm the performance of state of the art face recognition programs another study humorously called xe cthe elephant in the room xe showed that inserting small image of an out of place object such as an elephant in the corner of living room image strangely caused deep learning vision programs to suddenly misclassify other objects in the image
furthermore programs that have learned to play particular video or board game at xe csuperhuman xe level are completely lost when the game they have learned is slightly modified the background color on video game screen is changed the virtual xe cpaddle xe for hitting xe cballs xe changes position
these are only few examples demonstrating that the best programs can be unreliable when faced with situations that differ even to small degree from what they have been trained on the errors made by such systems range from harmless and humorous to potentially disastrous imagine for example an airport security system that won xe let you board your flight because your face is confused with that of criminal or self driving car that because of unusual lighting conditions fails to notice that you are about to cross the street
even more worrisome are recent demonstrations of the vulnerability of systems to so called adversarial examples in these malevolent hacker can make specific changes to images sound waves or text documents that while imperceptible or irrelevant to humans will cause program to make potentially catastrophic errors
the possibility of such attacks has been demonstrated in nearly every application domain of including computer vision medical image processing speech recognition and language processing numerous studies have demonstrated the ease with which hackers could in principle fool face and object recognition systems with specific minuscule changes to images put inconspicuous stickers on stop sign to make self driving car xe vision system mistake it for yield sign or modify an audio signal so that it sounds like background music to human but instructs siri or alexa system to perform silent command
these potential vulnerabilities illustrate the ways in which current progress in is stymied by the barrier of meaning anyone who works with systems knows that behind the facade of humanlike visual abilities linguistic fluency and game playing prowess these programs do not xe in any humanlike way xe understand the inputs they process or the outputs they produce the lack of such understanding renders these programs susceptible to unexpected errors and undetectable attacks
what would be required to surmount this barrier to give machines the ability to more deeply understand the situations they face rather than have them rely on shallow features to find the answer we need to look to the study of human cognition
our own understanding of the situations we encounter is grounded in broad intuitive xe ccommon sense knowledge xe about how the world works and about the goals motivations and likely behavior of other living creatures particularly other humans additionally our understanding of the world relies on our core abilities to generalize what we know to form abstract concepts and to make analogies xe in short to flexibly adapt our concepts to new situations researchers have been experimenting for decades with methods for imbuing systems with intuitive common sense and robust humanlike generalization abilities but there has been little progress in this very difficult endeavor
programs that lack common sense and other key aspects of human understanding are increasingly being deployed for real world applications while some people are worried about xe csuperintelligent xe the most dangerous aspect of systems is that we will trust them too much and give them too much autonomy while not being fully aware of their limitations as the researcher pedro domingos noted in his book xe cthe master algorithm xe xe cpeople worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world but the real problem is that they xe re too stupid and they xe ve already taken over the world xe
the race to commercialize has put enormous pressure on researchers to produce systems that work xe cwell enough xe on narrow tasks but ultimately the goal of developing trustworthy will require deeper investigation into our own remarkable abilities and new insights into the cognitive mechanisms we ourselves use to reliably and robustly understand the world unlocking xe barrier of meaning is likely to require step backward for the field away from ever bigger networks and data collections and back to the field xe roots as an interdisciplinary science studying the most challenging of scientific problems the nature of intelligence

china xe facial recognition start ups are attracting big investments at time when silicon valley xe giants are facing backlash over their use of the technology
in the past week chinese facial recognition companies according to pair of reports were close to raising as much as billion those investments would build on billions of dollars that investors have already put into the companies
the investments reflect facial recognition xe embrace by beijing which has created better environment for companies to test the technology than in the west and that could help china deploy advanced systems faster and more broadly than america
softbank xe billion vision fund was seeking billion stake in sensetime an artificial intelligence company in beijing bloomberg reported last week citing anonymous sources sensetime makes facial recognition software used in applications like monitoring cctv footage and checking consumer xe likeness to validate digital payments
on monday bloomberg reported that according to anonymous sources the chinese company megvii would close million funding round xe cwithin weeks xe alibaba and hong kong based boyu capital are expected to contribute megvii is the developer of face the facial recognition system already used in china to grant or deny people access to buildings or check if the driver of didi ride hailing car is legitimate among other things
sensetime has already raised over billion in funding since it was founded in according to data from amp global market intelligence and as recently as may was valued at about billion investors included alibaba and bank of china as well as the american firms qualcomm silver lake tiger global management and fidelity international
megvii xe previous funding round raised million from chinese companies like foxconn and ant financial as well as several domestic investment funds it also received money from the moscow based russian direct investment fund and south korea xe sk group
the facial recognition systems being built by sensetime and megvii use artificial intelligence to discern individuals from one another in images or video by studying libraries of existing content it is one of the more established machine learning techniques which means that it has found some practical application in consumer products xe such as apple xe face id which allows user to unlock his or her iphone by looking at it or facebook xe tools which can recognize users in uploaded images
such software has proved controversial because of the privacy issues that it raises law enforcement xe use of it to identify criminals or track citizens in particular has drawn pushback
but even if its citizens have such concerns china xe government wants to use facial recognition to create vast national surveillance system and it has created an environment to foster its development
the country xe push to become technological powerhouse has created wave of promising start ups its desire to track its citizens has also meant that many of them have focused specifically on image recognition and there are close ties between many of these start ups and the government which allows companies to apply their software to huge state data sets the chief executive of sensetime which has contracts with the police department in chongqing and china mobile told the financial times in january that the company had xe cprocessed million identities for facial recognition companies can xe test on so many customers xe
similar arrangements have existed in the united states but american technology companies have recently run into resistance when working with government agencies
amazon endured heavy lobbying from shareholders the american civil liberties union and staff about the use of its rekognition software by police to identify people microsoft too has suffered blowback over project to help develop for immigration and customs enforcement and google ultimately decided not to renew contract with the pentagon that called for using image recognition to improve the performance of drone operations
in the wake of those criticisms microsoft has actually called on congress to regulate the use of facial recognition technology
the nature of means that software systems can be improved by crunching through larger and larger data sets that can be provided by the government xe from things like cctv footage driving license images and more china xe start ups then are enjoying the benefits of improving their technology inside projects that america xe tech giants might be lobbying their own way out of

with their eyes trained on gilded frame containing smeared half formed image of distinguished gentleman small group of potential bidders gathered friday night over cocktails at christie xe new york and heard the pitch here was the first portrait generated by an algorithm to come up for auction the portrait produced by artificial intelligence hung on the wall opposite an andy warhol print and just to the right of bronze work by roy lichtenstein
there were some smiles and at least one frown two people snapped cellphone pictures of the work which looked as though someone had taken sponge to th century oil portrait the arrival of what some call the infant stages of the next great art movement at one of the world xe leading auction houses was greeted nonchalantly with nod of understanding and sip of mezcal margarita
christie xe is hoping for more explosive reaction on thursday when the gavel comes down on xe cedmond de belamy from la famille de belamy xe formally testing the art market xe interest in ai art the work xe estimated at xe was collaboration by the members of obvious french trio composed of student of machine learning and two business school graduates none of whom have background in art there was no paint or brushes involved just an algorithm that learns to imitate sets of images fed by humans xe in this case thousands of portraits spanning the th century to the th
but is it art fr xc xa xc xa rique baumgartner an art historian at columbia university said the ai work raised questions about xe cintention and authorship xe but so too did artists from the past including marcel duchamp who famously made art out of urinal she went on to compare the portrait xe contrasting tones coupled with the subject xe sober dress with the old master of the dutch golden age rembrandt van rijn xe though she quickly added xe cthat xe if look half closing my eyes xe
the unusual sale shows the challenge traditional auction houses face staying relevant in culture that moves at wifi enabled speeds christie xe xe which shattered auction house records in when it sold million leonardo da vinci painting xe reached out directly to obvious this year rather than working through seller it is the only ai work in thursday xe sale of lots
surprisingly the loudest criticism has come not from the art establishment but from the small but passionate community of artists who work with ai many of whom say that what christie xe and obvious suggested was groundbreaking was in fact effectively ai art ahmed elgammal the director of the art and artificial intelligence laboratory at rutgers university said that the technology used to create the work generative adversarial networks or gans had been used by artists since around xe cthis group was totally irrelevant xe he scoffed
mario klingemann german artist known for his work with gans put it bluntly xe cwhen saw that announcement xe of the auction he said xe cmy reaction was xe you can xe be serious xe xe he compared the portrait by obvious xe cto connect the dots children xe painting xe
richard lloyd the international head of the prints amp multiples department at christie xe who brought the work in acknowledged that he hadn xe made an exhaustive search of the small but very active field of ai art xe ci just responded to it and thought it xe be cool xe he said
he added of ai art xe cit xe just personal sort of interest xe ve had for quite few years xe he said he had been inspired by report earlier this year that nicolas laugero lasserre french collector had privately purchased portrait from obvious for about euros or about
what struck mr lloyd most he said was the work xe resemblance to european portraiture xe cit looks like something you xe expect christie xe to sell xe he explained xe cwe xe re the people who sold the leonardo for million xe
he thought that the work obvious was doing would be good way to ease potential buyers at christie xe into work made with ai xe ci like the fact that it didn xe at first blush look different xe he said
many artists and researchers who specialize in artistic applications of ai technology while generally glad of the potential exposure the sale could bring say that the portrait chosen by christie xe is derivative codes written to produce the kind of images obvious has made are also shared freely online among enthusiasts raising questions of originality
for its part obvious acknowledges that the technology it used was gleaned from others xe cit xe open source xe explained pierre fautrel one of the group xe members in an interview in new york last week xe cwe took lot of different parts from different people xe
the biggest difference between the obvious portrait and their predecessors xe is the fact that obvious had theirs printed on canvas and xe csigned xe in the bottom right corner with mathematical function used to produce it they also had it extravagantly framed xe cwe xe re introducing it to people who do not necessarily know what gan algorithm is xe mr lloyd explained speaking to the presentation xe cit has to be all things being equal comparatively simple xe
the opportunity to capitalize on the buzz surrounding artificial intelligence fits in with christie xe efforts to market itself in new ways
in july it held its first art amp tech summit focused on the theme of blockchain the technology behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin obvious themselves have sold art on superrare an online marketplace that allows users to buy and sell digital artwork using cryptocurrency
brick and mortar auction houses have been slow to accept art that explores new technologies to be sure sotheby xe christie xe and phillips offer plenty of digitally generated works by blue chip artists like andreas gursky and christopher wool but the sort of digital video and virtual reality pieces that are featured routinely at contemporary art biennials rarely if ever appear at auction houses
artists in the field are hoping that works sold at auctions like christie xe will increasingly enter private collections that appears to be happening more often earlier this year the new delhi art gallery nature morte hosted what was billed as india xe first exhibition of work made entirely by ai including works by mr klingemann tom white memo akten jake elwes and anna ridler in december dr elgammal of rutgers will exhibit ai art for sale at scope miami beach satellite fair during the time of art basel miami beach
who knows what art historians of the future will say about these works and the impact of ai as tool for artists but dr baumgartner at columbia offered gut response to the obvious portrait
xe cit xe just so strange xe she said
an earlier version of this article misstated where ai work will be exhibited for sale in miami it will be shown at scope miami beach not art basel miami beach

just few years ago thomas siebel often faced skepticism when encouraging big companies to adopt internet style cloud computing many companies he said had qualms about relying on the faraway data centers
now his customers have different concern one cloud service isn xe enough
xe cthey don xe want to be tied to one big tech company xe said mr siebel chief executive of iot software company that uses cloud computing to analyze data coming from industrial machines
and mr siebel is adapting after initially working closely with amazon pioneer in cloud computing iot now also has technology and marketing partnership with microsoft and it is negotiating similar agreement with google
for few years it looked like amazon would run away with the cloud computing business piling up market share as it has with online shopping but in the past couple of years many companies have decided that they don xe want to depend on amazon alone and are spreading out their business
that has helped microsoft most of all and the software giant has emerged as strong no in the cloud market microsoft provided further evidence of its rise in the cloud business on thursday when it reported its most recent quarterly financial results
microsoft xe azure unit which supplies cloud based computer processing and storage and competes most directly with amazon web services grew by percent over the same period year ago the company also reported strong growth in its other cloud offerings
microsoft xe profit increased percent to billion or share that was slightly above analysts xe average forecast of share as compiled by thomson reuters ibes
revenue rose percent to billion in its fiscal fourth quarter that ended in june higher than the wall street consensus estimate of billion
the competition to supply the foundation layer of computing and software xe the cloud era equivalent of an operating system xe is heated and costly the biggest players analysts estimate are spending up to billion year on their global networks of data centers
this core cloud business is billion year market which grew by percent in the first quarter of this year according to synergy research group in that fast growing market amazon holds percent share unchanged since the end of over the same span microsoft xe share climbed from percent to percent and google xe doubled to percent
john dinsdale chief analyst at synergy research predicted that the cloud giants will get bigger and capture steadily rising share of corporate technology spending xe especially as they add new capabilities like machine learning and artificial intelligence to their services
xe cthe information technology market is going to increasingly gravitate towards small number of hyperscale cloud providers xe mr dinsdale said
in recent research report on that market gartner identified three top tier companies xe amazon microsoft and google and it listed only three others alibaba oracle and ibm as their competitors
xe cit xe two horse race between amazon and microsoft at this stage xe said raj bala gartner analyst xe cgoogle is making headway nipping at their heels but it xe still behind the leaders xe
for amazon and google cloud computing services were natural outgrowth of their original businesses xe commerce for amazon and search for google both companies were born on the internet
not so for microsoft which has made the most striking transition to the cloud its heritage corporate wealth and industry dominance was based on selling packaged software and its windows operating system for personal computers
microsoft xe later forays into new markets were typically late and hobbled by the company xe windows fixation its failed mobile operating system for example was widely criticized as kludgy attempt to shoehorn windows onto smartphone
the company xe path to cloud computing was lengthy and sometimes halting even if the technical roots stretch back many years its msn online service and internet explorer browser had their heydays in the more recently the company poured resources into its bing search engine
in late ray ozzie microsoft xe chief technical officer wrote lengthy memo xe cthe internet services disruption xe laying out the challenge and opportunity ahead for the company
in two years after amazon entered the cloud market team of the microsoft xe brightest scientists set to work on cloud project code named red dog in microsoft introduced its cloud service but it did not have an offering comparable to amazon xe until analysts say
before he became microsoft xe chief executive in satya nadella held senior roles in its cloud online services and search businesses once he took over mr nadella accelerated investment in the cloud unit and focused microsoft xe sales teams on the business analysts say
unlike his predecessor steven ballmer mr nadella xe career was not steeped in windows and the business model of packaged software the traditional software business relied on product licenses with hefty payments up front rather than the pay for use subscriptions of the cloud world
xe ctechnology was not really the obstacle for microsoft the problem was the business model xe said michael cusumano professor at the massachusetts institute of technology xe sloan school of management xe cnadella has changed the strategy and the culture xe
amazon holds some formidable advantages in the cloud market it has the most customers xe some spending more than million year xe and more than consulting partners to help companies use increasing amounts of amazon cloud services many corporate technology managers see amazon as the safe choice
but microsoft has the advantage of being mainly supplier of technology to businesses unlike amazon and google its longstanding relationships with corporate customers analysts say are helping microsoft gain ground as mainstream companies increasingly move to cloud technology microsoft has recently announced cloud deals with companies including walmart general electric bayer starbucks and campbell soup
microsoft xe offerings have steadily improved but even mark russinovich chief technology officer for azure pointed to the company xe roots in business as driving force
xe cthe relationships we have with companies understanding their needs is really helping with these migrations to our cloud xe mr russinovich said

google xe new machine learning tools for its mail service can save you time and typos xe as long as you are comfortable sharing your thoughts with the software
by biersdorfer
the new gmail feature that lets the software write your mail messages for you sounds intriguing if not unsettling how does it work and has the feature rolled out to regular users so can see it for myself
the smart compose feature of google xe recent gmail update does not exactly write your full message for you the program uses machine learning techniques to evaluate what you are writing xe and then suggests what to type next based on that analysis gmail xe text suggestions appear in slightly lighter gray type at the end of the sentence you are writing if you choose to accept the computer generated words tap the tab key to add the material and move on to the next sentence
in theory the smart compose tool can speed up your message composition and cut down on typographical errors while xe cmachine learning xe means the software and not human is scanning your work in progress to get information for the predictive text function you are sharing information with google when you use its products
if you have already updated to the new version of gmail you can try out smart compose by going to the general tab in settings and turning on the check box next to enable experimental access next click save changes at the bottom of the settings screen
when you return to the general tab of the gmail settings scroll down to the newly arrived smart compose section and confirm that xe cwriting suggestions on xe is enabled if you do not care for google xe assistance after sampling the feature you can return to the settings and click xe cwriting suggestions off xe to disable smart compose
the new feature is available only for english composition at the moment and disclaimer from google warns xe csmart compose is not designed to provide answers and may not always predict factually correct information xe google also warns that experimental tools like smart compose are still under development and that the company may change or remove the features at any time
personal tech invites questions about computer based technology to techtip nytimes com this column will answer questions of general interest but letters cannot be answered individually

the words xe xe xe cgood xe and xe ctech xe probably don xe seem like they belong in the same paragraph let alone the same sentence but stay with me here
it xe true that this was horrible year for many of the tech industry xe biggest companies amazon held nationwide beauty pageant for its new headquarters raising hopes that the company would help transform struggling city then picked the two places that needed it the least executives from facebook google and twitter got hauled before congress to apologize for gestures wildly in all directions one of uber xe self driving cars killed someone and then there was elon musk
but the tech sector is more than its giants
last year handed out xe cgood tech xe awards to handful of companies nonprofit organizations and people who used technology to help others in real tangible ways the goal was to shine spotlight on few less heralded projects that may not get front page headlines or billions of dollars in funding but are actually trying to fulfill the tech industry xe stated goal of improving the world
xe continuing that tradition this year in the spirit of reminding us that although scandals and wrongdoing in tech rightly get lot of attention there xe good happening elsewhere
to zipline and swoop aero for using drones to heal the sick
for years consumer drones were hyped as new technology that would soon fill the skies over america xe cities delivering packages and surveilling the populace luckily that hasn xe happened yet but elsewhere drone companies are doing real work
one of these efforts is zipline start up that uses drones to deliver blood and medicine to medical facilities in remote areas that can xe be easily reached by traditional vehicles the company began operating in rwanda where it says it has made more than deliveries and this year expanded to ghana
another is swoop aero an australian drone delivery company that partnered with unicef this year to deliver vaccines to the remote south pacific nation of vanuatu where roughly percent of children do not get properly vaccinated one nurse in the country told the new york times that the drone deliveries xe cwill change my life xe
to upsolve for helping people go bankrupt
for many low income americans declaring personal bankruptcy can be painful but necessary way to get rid of exorbitant medical bills or predatory lenders but it xe often expensive to hire bankruptcy lawyer and hard to navigate the maze of paperwork
upsolve nonprofit organization founded by harvard graduate and lawyer built tool that has been referred to as the xe cturbotax of bankruptcy xe the software collects financial information from users automatically fills out their forms and passes them to lawyer who reviews them before the user submits bankruptcy claim in it helped users in states discharge total of more than million in debt according to rohan pavuluri the company xe chief executive
to joy buolamwini timnit gebru and anima anandkumar for calling out bias
artificial intelligence will be one of the most important areas of computer science in the coming years it xe also one of the least diverse just percent of researchers are women and the number of black and latino executives in the field is vanishingly small three leading researchers are trying to change that
ms buolamwini researcher at the media lab is the founder of the algorithmic justice league an organization trying to fight what it calls the xe ccoded gaze xe of biased algorithms this year she and ms gebru xe google researcher and co founder of group called black in xe released study that showed that three leading facial recognition algorithms were substantially worse at classifying darker faces than lighter faces and worse at classifying women xe faces than men xe faces the study set off alarm bells at leading tech companies and was widely cited as evidence of the need for more diversity in the field
separately ms anandkumar nvidia xe director of machine learning research and professor at caltech saw that the name of the field xe marquee annual event xe the neural information processing systems conference or nips xe had been used as fodder for sexist jokes so she started protestnips campaign to change the name and drew up petition that gathered more than signatures eventually the conference xe board relented and the event is now abbreviated as xe cneurips xe it was small gesture of inclusion that could go long way toward making women feel more welcome in the field for years to come
to promise uptrust and clear my record for helping solve our prison problem
ending mass incarceration has long been seen as political challenge but these three companies are trying to show that technology can help
promise is an app built to keep people out of jail aimed at pretrial defendants who cannot afford to post cash bail it creates customized care plans for each user sends them reminders of court dates and other critical appointments and allows courts to monitor their progress the company which participated in the ycombinator start up program recently raised million from investors including jay xe roc nation fund and first round capital
another start up uptrust offers similar text message based system that sends personalized appointment reminders to low income clients and can connect them to services that make getting to court easier such as rides or child care the service is already up and running in handful of states including baltimore county md and palm beach county fla

to workers at big tech companies for holding their employers accountable
the most heartening trend to come out of large tech companies in was surge in employee led activism protests by regulators shareholders and users have thus far failed to stop the worst excesses of the industry leaving these companies xe own employees xe who are expensive and hard to replace and therefore have lots of leverage xe to agitate for change from within
at google group of employees went public with concerns about project dragonfly secret google project to create censored version of its search engine for china their activism resulted in petition which was signed by hundreds of google employees to demand that the company cease work on the project
another group of employees spoke up after the times reported on the million payout made to the former google executive andy rubin who was accused of sexual misconduct their efforts culminated in employee protest walkout
workers at amazon and microsoft have also spoken up for change within their companies on issues ranging from climate change to surveillance ethics and the decision to work with federal immigration agencies
these workers didn xe solve every problem in tech overnight but they have created playbook for other employee activists to follow more important they have finally given their executives measure of accountability xe something they proved they will badly need in

many in the tech industry don xe want to be part of the military industrial complex but defense work is already part of silicon valley xe dna
by margaret xe mara
ms xe mara professor of history is the author of forthcoming book about the origins of silicon valley
the sunny precincts of silicon valley have been wrestling for months with the question of whether technology companies should stay out of work related to the military google recently announced that it would no longer compete for billion pentagon cloud computing contract microsoft employees have pressured its chief executive to do the same
but one tech leader has been clear about his support for the pentagon saying xe cif big tech companies are going to turn their back on the department of defense this country is going to be in trouble xe that was jeff bezos chief executive of amazon in an interview with wired on oct amazon is the likely winner of that contract xe state of affairs that prompted two members of congress to call for an investigation into the bid process this week meanwhile site in northern virginia down the road from the pentagon has emerged as front runner for amazon xe second headquarters
it may not be popular position but mr bezos xe comments reveal an important truth the pentagon has been part of the silicon valley story all along defense contracts during and after world war ii turned silicon valley from somnolent landscape of fruit orchards into hub of electronics production and innovations ranging from mainframes to microprocessors to the internet
the american tech economy rests on the foundations of the military industrial complex yet silicon valley xe culture is deeply influenced by skepticism about this same military establishment
unlike the atomic cities los alamos and hanford wash or the aerospace capitals los angeles and seattle the valley built small microwaves and radar for high frequency communication transistors and integrated circuits the nature of this work distanced the region xe technologists from the more ominous elements of america xe great scientific push silicon valley built elegant miniaturized machines that could power missiles and rockets but that also held endless possibilities for peaceful use in watches calculators appliances and computers large and small
the result is an enduring technological optimism early silicon valley didn xe have robert oppenheimer publicly despairing over his murderous creation instead it had an ebullient regional booster fred terman an engineer and university administrator who used the bounty of military money to turn stanford from middling school with good football team into an engineering powerhouse
big defense certainly made its mark the region xe biggest employer from the through the end of the cold war was lockheed local start ups of the time also benefited and they attracted people with engineering backgrounds not necessarily military ones take for example david packard the co founder of hewlett packard an outspoken critic of government overreach packard believed that tech businesses should aspire to higher things xe ci think many people assume wrongly that company exists simply to make money xe he once told hp executives xe cwhile this is an important result of company xe existence we have to go deeper to find the real reasons for our being xe
the next generation of silicon valley technologists took these sentiments further they grew up dreaming of space and winning science fairs supported by defense money their first encounters with computers were often in government funded university labs yet by the time they graduated from college in the late and early many of them wanted nothing to do with the military industrial complex so they seeded companies that repurposed technologies built for war to everyday life they stayed in academia moved into industrial research labs or started storefront computer education centers and community message boards
then they founded computer companies infused with an ethos that was part counterculture part cowboy xe cthe personal computer operator is the electronic man on horseback riding into the sinking western sun xe declared columnist in the newsletter infoworld in xe che is the last of the rugged individualists and the personal computer is his only effective weapon xe
the military origins of modern tech gradually faded from view but the business of war didn xe go away the pentagon remained the only place with the resources and the patience to fund blue sky research that the market wasn xe quite ready for mr bezos knows this history well his beloved grandfather lawrence preston gise was one of the first employees of the pentagon xe advanced research agency darpa in the and money from darpa helped spur breakthroughs in high speed networking voice recognition and internet search today it is funding research in artificial intelligence and machine learning subterranean exploration and deep space satellites high performance molecules and better gps
whether their employees realize it or not today xe tech giants all contain some defense industry dna the result is the conflicted identity we now see in silicon valley
but the american military xe heavy reliance on high tech products means that backing away from defense work isn xe likely there are fearsome national security threats including cyberattacks on infrastructure and hacks of personal and electoral data that cannot be overcome without close partnership between the pentagon and technology companies these companies need to do more to explain to their employees and their customers what they are doing and why this involves much fuller reckoning with the long and complicated history of silicon valley and the business of war

fiat chrysler automobiles was facing an uncertain future even before the man who led its unlikely turnaround became gravely ill
after he became incapacitated from complications of shoulder surgery the company was forced to hastily replace sergio marchionne as chief executive over the weekend fiat chrysler now must find way to deal with its own shortcomings without him xe even as the auto industry experiences changes that would be challenging enough under the best of circumstances
now the hard decisions fall to the new chief executive mike manley who has been running the arm of the company that is easily its best reason for optimism
the italian american automaker has reported steady earnings driven by the jeep and ram brands that have been run by mr manley but the fiat dodge and chrysler nameplates contribute little to its bottom line
the company lags its rivals in china the world xe largest auto market and gets three quarters of its profits from north america where the entire industry is experiencing slowdown
competitors like general motors and ford motor have sped ahead with development of electric vehicles and self driving technology while fiat chrysler has been slow to do the same it does not operate its own financing company competitive advantage for its rivals who are able to offer attractive discounted loans and leases
and the possibility that president trump could push for tariffs on imports of cars and auto parts has sent uncertainty rippling through the entire industry
xe csergio has done an incredible job revitalizing the company since chrysler xe bankruptcy in xe said rebecca lindland an analyst at kelley blue book an auto research firm xe cbut there xe more work to be done there xe still lot that needs to be addressed xe
now fiat chrysler which has seen its stock lose around fifth of its value since january must do it without mr marchionne who has led the company for years the company declined to comment on mr marchionne xe condition but the decision to replace him on saturday effective immediately was clear sign that his prognosis was poor
the carmaker xe shares fell more than percent at one point in morning trading in europe on monday before recovering some of those losses
fiat chrysler will provide fresh glimpse of its finances on wednesday when it reports its second quarter results wall street analysts expect rise in earnings driven almost exclusively by robust jeep and ram truck sales year ago it reported second quarter net income of billion euros on revenue of xe xac billion
the company xe profitability is perhaps the central issue that mr manley will have to tackle profit amounted to about percent of fiat chrysler xe revenue last year well short of the percent achieved by general motors in june mr marchionne and his executive team laid out business plan that calls for spending billion euros to develop more than two dozen new vehicles including electric models all while slashing costs by xe xac billion xe tough balancing act for an automaker the goal is to more than double its profit margin by
american dealers expressed confidence in mr manley xe cwe xe re thrilled with his selection xe said wes lutz owner of chrysler dodge jeep franchise in jackson mich and chairman of the national automobile dealers association xe che xe passionate about product he xe worked on the retail side so he understands dealers any time you have who understands dealers you usually have good market share so xe excited about mike manley xe
mr manley who was not available for an interview has the unenviable task of replacing mr marchionne larger than life executive who quoted both philosophers and pop music lyrics with ease and pushed his workers to match his boundless energy
ms lindland said that mr manley xe cis different kind of character xe
xe che xe quieter xe ms lindland said xe cnobody has the force of personality that sergio had but mike can motivate people he xe been doing that at jeep xe
mr manley took over jeep in and has nearly tripled its global sales the company expects to sell million jeeps this year and its models are now produced in plants in six countries when mr manley took over jeeps were only made in four plants all in the united states
xe cmike has been one of the major contributors to xe success and he has remarkable track record of accomplishments xe john elkann the great great grandson of fiat xe founder giovanni agnelli said in an email to fiat chrysler employees
mr manley will have to rely heavily on the sport utility vehicle line going forward consumers in the united states china and elsewhere are increasingly opting for roomier models like and pricier jeeps like the grand cherokee generate hefty profits with its heritage dating back to the rugged military vehicles used in world war ii jeep also has global appeal that other fiat chrysler brands lack under the company xe five year business plan jeep is scheduled to introduce midsize pickup truck next year as well as new hybrid or battery powered models in china jeep would offer four fully electric models
mr manley xe chas to grow jeep in china xe said tom lasorda former chrysler chief executive xe cthat xe the future xe
in the united states market the new models can xe come soon enough especially the seven passenger jeep grand wagoneer that xe scheduled to arrive in xe cwe needed that vehicle yesterday xe said mr lutz the dealership owner in the first six months of this year fiat chrysler xe united states sales rose percent due exclusively to higher jeep sales
fiat chrysler also plans to spend heavily to develop new models for its ram alfa romeo and maserati lines all of which are solidly profitable but the future for the company xe other brands is uncertain
chrysler only offers two models and has little presence outside america dodge has been reduced mainly to selling big powerful sports cars segment whose sales are declining fiat chrysler also spent billions of dollars to introduce fiat small cars to american buyers but so far this year it has only sold about fiats in the united states the company sells that many ram trucks in one day
those brands have been hurt as consumers have turned away from passenger cars when mr marchionne decided to stop making small and midsize cars in the united states in it was considered risky move but ford recently said it would follow suit it plans to drop venerable models such as the fusion and taurus within few years
in light of the shift in the market mr manley will probably eventually have to address the question of whether to kill dodge or chrysler and whether to continue to sell fiats in the united states ms lindland said
but the chrysler brand could have future in autonomous vehicles even though fiat chrysler has done little to develop its own self driving cars
mr marchionne long expressed doubt about investing in technology whose future is unknown but fiat chrysler has partnered with waymo the self driving car company that was spun out of google it is supposed to produce up to chrysler pacifica minivans that waymo will equip and use for driverless ride service it is starting
xe cthey need to make sure they don xe fall too far behind on autonomy and waymo may be the way they do that xe ms lindland said
an earlier version of this article misidentified fiat xe founder and also misstated john elkann xe relationship to him fiat was founded by giovanni agnelli not by gianni agnelli and mr elkann is giovanni agnelli xe great great grandson not his grandson an earlier version of picture caption with the article misstated the given name of fiat chrysler xe new chief executive he is mike manley not mark

in rural texas county lidar sensor technology is being tested as way to spot illegal intruders from mexico that use could divide workers in silicon valley
quanergy lidar sensor in del rio tex near the mexican border the sensor using driverless car technology captures three dimensional image of anyone who walks into the area credit credit tamir kalifa for the new york times

del rio tex xe in this tiny town at the edge of south texas brush country black steel fence runs along the mexican border about feet high and topped by small metal spires that bend toward mexico it stretches west from border patrol checkpoint for about mile and half then it stops
where the fence ends creek snakes off the rio grande up through private ranch where cattle wander between the mesquite trees there beside the creek gully small black cylinder sits atop metal pole looming over the small trees it is lidar sensor the same laser based technology that gives sight to self driving cars from its perch it captures three dimensional image of anyone who walks into the area
the sensor belongs to silicon valley start up called quanergy one of number of companies trying to land business along the mexican border while president trump still vows to build physical border wall these companies hope to help build xe cvirtual wall xe that some policymakers believe would be more effective than miles of concrete and metal virtual wall would not offer physical deterrence but some people believe it would be cheaper to build and maintain
xe cthe only way to have operational control of the border is to look at all miles of it at the same time xe said representative will hurd republican who represents val verde county west of san antonio xe cand the only way to do that is through technology xe
founded in and backed by more than million in funding quanergy was one of the many lidar makers created amid rush to develop driverless cars over the last year that investment boom started to feel like glut as autonomous vehicle technology improved more slowly than some had hoped border control is another potential market for lidar which can spot objects and people in all sorts of conditions day or night
working with the val verde county sheriff xe office quanergy has spent the last year testing its lidar sensors on the ranch in del rio angling for contract with united states customs and border protection
range of technologies being developed in silicon valley is well suited to border control when combined with recent advances in artificial intelligence digital cameras lidar and other sensors can identify and track people and objects with considerable accuracy
but many tech workers have made it clear in recent months that they don xe want to work on military or government surveillance projects in june after more than employees protested the project google withdrew from an effort to build artificial intelligence for the defense department border and immigration enforcement is even more controversial microsoft and salesforce employees for example have protested the companies xe contracts with immigration and customs enforcement
still where some see moral quandary others see business opportunity more than companies have worked on the pentagon project that google pulled out of
another start up anduril is testing technology in the rio grande valley that uses things like digital cameras and artificial intelligence to track people coming across the border its founders included palmer luckey who built the virtual reality company oculus and sold it to facebook for billion in
mr luckey left facebook two years later after it was revealed that he supported political action group that spread anti hillary clinton memes not long after he started working on his new company trae stephens the investor who founded anduril with mr luckey tried to distance the company from mr luckey xe history of political provocation when asked about it in an interview
xe cit is national security company xe he said
quanergy xe executives also hope to keep politics at arm xe length in recent interview louay eldada founder and the chief executive of quanergy said the company always planned to expand beyond driverless cars border control he said was an obvious candidate
cogniac another silicon valley start up that offers technology for identifying people and objects in camera images is exploring similar work
customs and border protection already uses wide variety of technology on the border including video cameras flying drones aerostat blimps infrared goggles and pressure sensors but these technologies are deployed in piecemeal way and officials have yet to use artificial intelligence that can automatically analyze data captured by cameras and other sensors
in many areas along the texas border there is no technology in place xe not even fences border patrol agents still use trucks to drag old tires up and down the border smoothing the dirt on roads and paths so they can spot footprints later they call it sign cutting xe
mr hurd the congressman is advocating for wider technological system xe cthe question is how do you cut for sign in the digital age xe he said xe cwe should get to point where we see absolutely everything coming across our border xe
that could include the kinds of sensors tested by quanergy in del rio which can capture activity across degrees and distance of about meters using this three dimensional view of an area software can automatically pinpoint people moving past and alert border agents
if lined up in large numbers and paired with cameras that snap images when movement is detected these sensors could provide more detailed picture of border activity and help agents organize their response
but the devices are limited if left unprotected they are easily vandalized and they require both electrical power and network connection quanergy has tested its sensors with solar panels which eliminate the need for power lines still along most parts of the border the authorities would have to install new fiber lines or cell towers
joe martinez val verde county xe sheriff has helped test the quanergy sensors he said he believed they could be big help along some parts of the border but if these sensors were used in the vast rocky undulating spaces in the western part of his county he said border and other law enforcement agents would have difficulty responding to alerts within any reasonable amount of time
xe cthe needs to the west are different xe mr martinez said xe cand the needs to the south are different xe
what xe more lidar sensors are expensive quanergy charges few thousand dollars per unit old tires are considerably cheaper
such sensors mr martinez and others said are best used in tandem with wide variety of other methods under development xe cthis is about layering of technologies xe said david aguilar former acting commissioner of customs and border protection and principal at global security and innovative strategies consulting firm in washington current officials with the agency said it was testing many technologies with companies in silicon valley with the goal of deploying new artificial intelligence techniques in the field
some question whether these technologies will eat away at the privacy of residents much of the land at the border is private
guadalupe correa cabrera professor at george mason university who specializes in border protection issues said authorities should concentrate on border checkpoints where large portion of illegal crossings occur
xe cnone of these things make sense to me xe said ms correa cabrera who is also fellow at the wilson center think tank in washington xe cwhy would we continue to spend on technology that is not solving the problem xe
but mr aguilar said he believed that demands on the border for new sensors and new artificial intelligence would grow
xe cwe started talking about this many years ago xe he said xe cbut the technology wasn xe as mature as it is now xe
an earlier version of this article misidentified the university where guadalupe correa cabrera is currently professor it is george mason university not the university of texas rio grande valley where she was previously member of the faculty

visionary research is no longer the most important element of progress
by kai fu lee
mr lee is venture capitalist and former artificial intelligence researcher
every technology goes through an age of discovery and an age of implementation during the age of discovery the critical work takes place in research laboratories where scientists make the breakthroughs that move the field forward during the age of implementation the technology reaches point of practical utility and begins spilling out of the lab and into the world
over the past decade xe ve watched firsthand as the field of artificial intelligence has transitioned from one phase to the other the and were period of discovery in one that participated in through my research on speech recognition at carnegie mellon university and apple more recently participated in the implementation phase through my work as the head of google china and as an early investor in the chinese mobile internet
this movement from discovery to implementation marks significant shift in xe center of gravity xe away from the united states and toward china the age of discovery relied heavily on innovation coming out of the united states which excels at visionary research and moonshot projects the country xe freewheeling intellectual environment unparalleled network of research universities and traditional openness to immigrants such as myself have for decades made it an incubator for big ideas in
implementation however plays to different set of strengths many of which are manifested in china abundant data hypercompetitive business landscape and government that actively adapts public infrastructure with in mind china also excels at turning an abstract scientific breakthrough into thousands of useful and commercially viable products this process which is far more challenging than most researchers acknowledge has driven the market capitalization of many chinese tech companies far beyond that of the american peers they were once accused of xe ccopying xe
visionary research will always be important to which means that china still has much to learn from the united states but as practical implementation increasingly becomes the name of the game the united states now has much to learn from china too
analysts in the west often acknowledge the areas in which china has an advantage in but they tend to misunderstand the nature of china xe strength in each one with regard to china xe abundant data analysts often point to the sheer size of china xe population which owns billion mobile internet devices and claim that lax privacy laws allow free for all with user data but china xe core data advantage lies not just in breadth the number of users and access the amount of data that users contribute but also in the depth of data on each user xe the real world activities of chinese people that are captured in digital format useful to an algorithm
for instance chinese consumers regularly use apps like wechat to do an astonishing range of real world things buy groceries book doctor xe appointments manage their electricity and water utilities take out microloans chinese people make up percent of global demand for bike sharing and ride hailing apps this widespread use of apps in part reflects xe cleapfrog effect xe chinese people never truly adopted credit cards so they jumped directly to mobile payments chinese hospitals never had extensive traditional systems for booking patients so they are jumping straight to smartphone apps and so on
what emerges from these enormous data flows is multidimensional picture of each chinese user which allows companies to better tailor their services silicon valley companies are working on similar products but the data at their disposal is largely limited to online activities google searches youtube views amazon purchases and facebook likes
with regard to its competitive business ecosystem for china xe advantage is frequently mischaracterized by western analysts who view chinese technology as built largely on intellectual property theft this misunderstanding reflects difference in cultural attitudes over perfectly legal form of copying imitating successful business model and then tweaking it
in silicon valley there is substantial stigma attached to imitating the business models or features of other companies doing so violates the xe cthink different xe ethos associated with innovators like steve jobs the result is that pioneers often go unchallenged for long periods allowed to dominate the industry even though they don xe explore or exploit all of their technology xe possibilities
in contrast chinese entrepreneurs have few qualms about imitating what works once concept is proved to have traction dozens or even hundreds of other companies rush into the industry setting off ferocious fight for survival the result is analogous to natural selection in evolution all the companies start from the same branch on the family tree but they make mutations in their product or business model to gain an edge the companies with tweaked products that work well survive and grow while businesses that are slow to adapt perish
you can see this clearly in how the sharing economy developed in china after companies like uber and didi proved the viability of ride sharing china xe start up world tried out every possible iteration of it shared basketballs shared umbrellas shared bicycles shared mobile phone chargers most of these efforts died quickly but those that survived xe including handful of the strongest shared bike start ups xe turned into multibillion dollar companies and revolutionized urban transport in just couple of years
finally there is the question of the chinese government xe support of in the simplistic story often told in the united states chinese bureaucrats in the central government pick winners among the companies load them up with enormous subsidies and then protect them from foreign competition but this account fundamentally misunderstands how the chinese government is encouraging implementation
the chinese government understands that as moves from affecting the purely digital world to the physical one public infrastructure and institutions will have to change if we want autonomous cars to reduce accidents we may need to embed sensors in our roads if we want powered diagnosis to spot cancer earlier we may need hospital administrators to develop data sharing agreements that protect privacy while also allowing research to be conducted these are decisions that entail degree of risk for public actors particularly in highly combative political environment where every misstep becomes fodder for the opposition
in declaring to be top national priority beijing has sent signal to local officials that they will be rewarded for fostering this kind of infrastructure the chinese model isn xe based on top down orders or limitless subsidies it xe based on encouraging local officials to make the changes needed in their area so that private companies can develop products that can actually be used
am arguing that china now has the recipe for success not at all the fact that the field is shifting from discovery to implementation does not mean that discovery no longer matters indeed with many problems in it is unclear which approach is best
consider an powered product like fully autonomous vehicles technology companies in both countries are still feverishly chasing the dream of the large scale deployment of cars that drive themselves far better than any human could who wins this race is likely to depend on whether the main obstacle turns out to be matter of core technology or simply execution details if it xe technical xe major improvements in core algorithms xe then the advantage goes to the united states if it xe implementation xe smart infrastructure or policy adaptation xe then the advantage goes to china
at this point we don xe know which it will be but we do know that each country can improve its odds of success by learning from the other xe strengths chinese researchers start ups and companies should let their imaginations run little wilder placing long term bets that give them chance of breaking new ground rather than playing catch up at the same time american companies should embrace the less glamorous business of relentlessly developing variations on proven concept and american policymakers could move away from hands off stance toward looking instead to actively adapt the nation xe physical structures and public institutions to better mesh with new technology
if both countries can make these shifts in perspective then what might look like zero sum battle for supremacy between china and the united states will begin to resemble something totally different an opportunity to learn across cultures and collectively advance the global project of building that improves human lives
kai fu lee kaifulee the chairman and chief executive of sinovation ventures is the author of the forthcoming book xe ca superpowers china silicon valley and the new world order xe from which this essay is adapted

san francisco xe machines are starting to learn tasks on their own they are identifying faces recognizing spoken words reading medical scans and even carrying on their own conversations
all this is done through so called neural networks which are complex computer algorithms that learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data but these neural networks create problem that scientists are trying to solve it is not always easy to tell how the machines arrive at their conclusions
on tuesday team at google took small step toward addressing this issue with the unveiling of new research that offers the rough outlines of technology that shows how the machines are arriving at their decisions
xe ceven seeing part of how decision was made can give you lot of insight into the possible ways it can fail xe said christopher olah google researcher
growing number of researchers are now developing ways to better understand neural networks jeff clune professor at university of wyoming who now works in the lab at the ride hailing company uber called this xe cartificial neuroscience xe
understanding how these systems work will become more important as they make decisions now made by humans like who gets job and how self driving car responds to emergencies
first proposed in the neural networks are meant to mimic the web of neurons in the brain but that is rough analogy these algorithms are really series of mathematical operations and each operation represents neuron google xe new research aims to show xe in highly visual way xe how these mathematical operations perform discrete tasks like recognizing objects in photos
inside neural network each neuron works to identify particular characteristic that might show up in photo like line that curves from right to left at certain angle or several lines that merge to form larger shape google wants to provide tools that show what each neuron is trying to identify which ones are successful and how their efforts combine to determine what is actually in the photo xe perhaps dog or tuxedo or bird
the kind of technology google is discussing could also help identify why neural network is prone to mistakes and in some cases explain how it learned this behavior mr olah said other researchers including mr clune believe they can also help minimize the threat of xe cadversarial examples xe xe where someone can potentially fool neural networks by say doctoring an image
researchers acknowledge that this work is still in its infancy jason yosinski who also works in uber xe lab which grew out of the company xe acquisition of start up called geometric intelligence called google xe technology idea xe cstate of art xe but he warned it may never be entirely easy to understand the computer mind
xe cto certain extent as these networks get more complicated it is going to be fundamentally difficult to understand why they make decisions xe he said xe cit is kind of like trying to understand why humans make decisions xe

technology and business writers from the times participated in the new work summit last week in half moon bay calif which featured some of the top tech minds in the country over day and half they engaged in spirited conversations about the relationship between artificial intelligence and human beings xe and how or whether the creators of should be held to ethical standards here are the takeaways from david gelles of the times xe corner office and the technology writers nellie bowles and cade metz
mr metz don xe know about you david and nellie but what struck me were the vast differences of opinion swirling around the notion of xe cethical artificial intelligence xe ethics are very much in the eye of the beholder
ms bowles they are my panel with the ethicist tristan harris and researcher meredith whittaker dove into some of the complexities for companies like google and facebook trying to establish ethical guidelines for what they xe re rolling out in some ways it xe unfair to ask an engineer to also be philosopher and even if company hopes that the engineers think about implications those workers mostly white mostly male mostly in office parks around palo alto cannot possibly conceive of how many lives the algorithms will impact and how so my panelists argued in favor of transparency as artificial intelligence is being developed companies should open up for researchers and the public to grok it and start having these debates and in terms of that morning there xe nothing better than philosophy by candlelight
mr gelles ah yes the lack of electricity the power was out the live stream was down and the stage was lit with candles it was good look for tech conference but yes ethics seemed well xe relative speakers like mr harris and ms whittaker spoke passionately about the need for companies to respect users xe privacy while former secretary of defense ash carter made compelling argument that launching tomahawk missile was not so different than dispatching swarm of autonomous killer drones
mr metz you can see this same split inside the big tech companies it was recently revealed that microsoft employees have protested the company xe decision to supply hololens augmented reality headsets to the military but brad smith who you interviewed on stage strongly defended this and other military projects for him this is about xe cdefending the freedoms of our country xe
mr gelles it xe refreshing to see big company stand up to its employees for once for so much of the last few years it has seemed like activist employees xe often small but vocal minority xe have been dictating the policies of big companies microsoft seems to have remembered that its employees work for the company and not the other way around
mr metz after google shut down some of its military work in response to employee protests many saw this as the beginning of something larger but you do wonder how much of that was driven by google xe unique corporate culture where there is open communication across the company and employees are on some level encouraged to voice their personal opinions
ms bowles exactly google is extremely unique and xe curious how long management will tolerate its rebellious work force facebook for example operates as an almost cult of secrecy and loyalty so you don xe see similar high profile protests in menlo park
mr gelles cade what xe your take on how impactful some of these technologies really are right now heard some examples of and machine learning being put to work in specific ways but at times it felt like everyone was still speculating about science fiction film
mr metz this is an ongoing problem there have been very real and very significant gains in image recognition speech recognition and language translation over the last several years that can help with talking digital assistants driverless cars and certain aspects of health care xe not to mention face recognition services and autonomous weapons but so many tech executives xe and the press xe talk about xe ca xe in weirdly exaggerated way driverless cars are still years from the mainstream better translation is very different from more general intelligence that can do anything human can do
mr gelles nellie you spoke with meredith whittaker and tristan harris two cautionary voices in tech today do you get the sense that the people really making decisions at companies like facebook and google are really listening to them or merely pretending to care about the issues they xe re raising
ms bowles would ask what exactly it means to care do they as people want an apocalypse in which we are all house cats for computers of course not but are they for profit companies that want to win this new arms race yes they seem to respond mostly to public opprobrium making major ethical changes after whistle blowers or big investigations come out youtube knows how troubling its youtube kids product is yet it has been running for years only after the public complains enough will they take filtering seriously or take the product off the market
mr gelles another through line in conversations during the week was the degree to which and automation could decimate thousands millions of jobs the consensus seems to be that enormous workplace displacement is imminent there xe less consensus about what to do about it nellie what do our all powerful silicon valley overlords say about all this are we all just going to live off universal basic income that supports our indulgent amazon prime habits
ms bowles feel like xe the bearer of bad news in this chat but guys the overlords are pretty sure that soon most people won xe be very useful recently profiled the silicon valley xe favorite philosopher yuval noah harari and this is his argument he hopes the futuristic vision he paints will be call to arms but most here are resigned to what they see as coming but yes that xe why they like ubi it seems like nice enough fix to stave off revolution
mr gelles did we mention that the fire alarm went off when the power finally came back on at the end of the day was about to walk onstage for one of the final sessions but then lights started flashing alarms started blaring and everyone had to evacuate the ballroom is that metaphor for something could an powered hotel have fixed that or was it just time to go home
ms bowles the building knew you were about to go on stage gelles
mr metz either that or the building isn xe nearly as intelligent as people make it out to be

there is no shortage of predictions about how artificial intelligence is going to reshape where how and if people work in the future
but the grand work changing projects of like self driving cars and humanoid robots are not yet commercial products more humble version of the technology instead is making its presence felt in less glamorous place the back office
new software is automating mundane office tasks in operations like accounting billing payments and customer service the programs can scan documents enter numbers into spreadsheets check the accuracy of customer records and make payments with few automated computer keystrokes
the technology is still in its infancy but it will get better learning as it goes so far often in pilot projects focused on menial tasks artificial intelligence is freeing workers from drudgery far more often than it is eliminating jobs
the bots are mainly observing following simple rules and making yes or no decisions not making higher level choices that require judgment and experience xe cthis is the least intelligent form of xe said thomas davenport professor of information technology and management at babson college
but all the signs point to much more to come big tech companies like ibm oracle and microsoft are starting to enter the business often in partnership with robotic automation start ups two of the leading start ups uipath and automation anywhere are already valued at more than billion the market for the robotlike software will nearly triple by by one forecast
xe cthis is the beginning of wave of technologies that will proliferate across the economy in the next decade xe said rich wong general partner at accel silicon valley venture capital firm and an investor in uipath
the emerging field has klutzy name xe crobotic process automation xe the programs xe often called bots xe fit into the broad definition of artificial intelligence because they use ingredients of technology like computer vision to do simple chores
for many businesses that is plenty nearly percent of the companies with more than billion in revenue have at least pilot programs underway using robotic automation according to research from mckinsey amp company the consulting firm
the companies and government agencies that have begun enlisting the automation software run the gamut they include general motors bmw general electric unilever mastercard manpower fedex cisco google the defense department and nasa
state auto insurance companies in columbus ohio started its first automation pilot project two years ago today it has software programs handling back office tasks with an estimated savings of hours of human work xe or the equivalent of about dozen full time workers xe on an annualized basis assuming standard hour work year
holly uhl technology manager who leads the automation program estimated that within two years the company xe bot population would double to and its hours saved would perhaps triple to nearly all in year after year savings rather than one time projects
cutting jobs ms uhl said is not the plan the goal for the company whose insurance offerings include auto commercial and workers xe compensation is to increase productivity and state auto xe revenue with limited additions to its head count she said
ms uhl said her message to workers is xe cwe xe re here to partner with you to find those tasks that drive you crazy xe
rebekah moore premium auditor at the company had one in mind premium auditors scrutinize insurance policies and make recommendations for changing rates they audit less than half of the policies ms moore said
the policies that will not be audited then have to be set aside and documented that step she explained is routine data entry task that involves fiddling with two computer programs plugging in codes and navigating drop down menus it takes minute or two but because auditors handle many thousands of policies the time adds up to about an hour day she estimated
starting in may bot took over that chore xe cno one misses that work xe ms moore said
is she worried about the bots climbing up the task ladder to someday replace her not at all she said xe cwe xe ll find things to do with our time higher value work xe said ms moore
on state auto xe current path her confidence seems justified if the company hits its target of hours in savings by that would be the equivalent of fewer than full time workers compared with state auto xe work force of the company plans to grow in the next two years if so state auto would most likely be hiring few dozen people fewer than it would otherwise
automation companies are eager to promote the bots as helpful assistants instead of job killers the technology they say will get smarter and more useful liberating workers rather than replacing them
xe cthe long term vision is to have one bot for every employee xe said bobby patrick chief market officer for uipath the company which is based in new york recently reported that its revenue more than tripled in the first half of to yearly rate of more than million
mihir shukla chief executive of automation anywhere refers to his company xe bots as xe cdigital colleagues xe in july the company announced it had raised million round of venture funding valuing the company at billion
the market for enhanced software automation is poised for rapid growth but that expansion analysts say will ultimately bring job losses
forrester research estimated that revenue would nearly triple to billion over the next three years and by robotic automation technology will be doing the equivalent work of nearly million humans worldwide forrester predicted
in dynamic global labor market that is not clear cut forecast of million layoffs the bots may do work not previously done by humans and people may move onto new jobs
xe cbut these initial bots will get better and the task harvesting will accelerate xe said craig le clair an analyst for forrester xe cfor workers there will be mix of automation dividends and pain xe
the recent research has examined jobs as bundles of tasks some of which seem ripe for replacement and others not so the technology xe immediate impact will resemble the experience to date with robotic software changing work more than destroying jobs

the justice department has said that the united states district court xe ruling in favor of at amp xe bid to acquire time warner will harm consumers
but judge richard leon who made the decision has done consumers favor his ruling will help legacy media companies stand up to facebook amazon apple netflix and google
these tech giants have revolutionized the customer experience and disrupted everything from our viewing choices to our shopping habits and how we pay for goods and services but some fear that those companies will use their scale influence and technological know how to eventually upend almost every industry
the question is at what point should regulators step in to check their ambitions
those five companies hold considerable influence over the internet search engines can direct consumers to preferred sites online retailers can direct us to their choice of offerings content is increasingly distributed by narrow set of platforms and algorithms and artificial intelligence deliver news according to our inferred preferences
this poses new challenges for regulators they must catch up to the reality that new technologies and the disruptive strategies of the companies employing them can lead to unassailable market positions that affect consumer choices
one way to improve competition would be to break up those heavyweights xe not unlike splitting at amp into eight xe cbaby bells xe nearly years ago or the european commission xe verdict on microsoft xe dominant market position in the
but until regulators conclude that such action is necessary the united states needs an approach to merger regulation that protects consumers by supporting transactions that create enterprises capable of standing head to head with the tech giants
the decision to allow at amp to acquire time warner is step in this direction so was the decision to approve disney xe purchase of much of st century fox
in rapidly transforming marketplace regulators should enable incumbents to stand up to the largest tech companies that are using new technologies xe such as cloud computing big data and artificial intelligence xe to upend existing industries
xe cold economy xe companies must be allowed to combine in order to increase their scale and innovation capabilities so that they are on level playing field with the tech giants
regulators must now take notice of the verdict in the at amp case so that they can calibrate their approach in the next round of transactions that will allow them to think more about creating rivals to the present crop of technology giants rather than standing by as they tighten their stronghold on consumers

san francisco xe technology companies rarely make money before they go public twitter was unprofitable when it listed on the stock market so were snap spotify and surveymonkey
for uber the question as the ride hailing giant prepares for public offering is even bigger than whether it can make money that xe because the company the most prominent tech start up of its generation will set the bar for other well known tech companies like slack and lyft as they also stampede toward the stock market this year
so far uber is not doing itself any favors on profits
the company reported on friday that it had narrowed its net loss in the fourth quarter of from year earlier but excluding certain one time items including the sale of some of its businesses uber xe losses for the quarter rose percent from the previous year to million
the losses were result of uber xe increasing its spending as it tries to outmuscle competitors many of which have intensified their efforts to add riders and drivers uber has responded by offering bigger incentives and more promotions to fend off rivals like doordash lyft and other ride hailing and food delivery services
uber made its financial disclosure as it hurtles toward what is set to be one of the biggest ever public offerings by tech company transportation colossus uber was privately valued at more than billion last year and proposals from investment bankers suggest that it could be worth as much as billion after going public the share sale will create enormous windfalls for uber xe many investors and for its founders and early employees
as private company uber is not required to disclose financial results but it has regularly done so over the past two years to inform investors about its business and perhaps to keep the depth of its losses from coming as surprise later
the latest set of figures probably uber xe last as private company will be closely scrutinized many investors initially give young and fast growing tech start ups pass for losing money but questions about whether such companies can ultimately be profitable eventually catch up with them investors criticized twitter for racking up losses before it finally began to make money last year and they have pushed down snap xe share price since its public offering partly because the company is still deeply unprofitable
in statement uber xe chief financial officer nelson chai did not address the company xe losses he said uber had xe cmaintained category leadership xe in its ride hailing business and he noted other bright spots including the company xe freight management business and nascent bike and scooter program
uber has long history of spending large sums of money ride hailing is inherently an expensive business that requires companies to expand into new markets for growth pay to recruit drivers and lower prices to grab business away from competitors
dara khosrowshahi uber xe chief executive has been under pressure to pare its losses and the company has pulled out of money losing markets like russia and southeast asia
some of the company xe losses have been overshadowed by its explosive growth in uber increased its total bookings xe what it charges customers for rides and food delivery xe to billion up percent from net revenue was billion percent increase
the company xe net revenue for last year xe fourth quarter was billion percent increase from year earlier and its gross bookings jumped percent to billion the company has billion in cash and its net loss was million
but uber xe profit margins have declined as it cut prices to match competitors and spent money on expanding its food delivery business uber eats the margins are also smaller on uber eats orders because the company pays commissions to restaurants as well as delivery drivers
uber xe self driving car program which will probably not yield revenue for years continues to burn cash the company returned its autonomous vehicles to public roads in december after month hiatus which was prompted when one of its vehicles fatally struck pedestrian in arizona

in the company started an ambitious flashy effort to create robots now its goals are more modest but the technology is subtly more advanced

mountain view calif xe google has quietly been retooling an ambitious but troubled robotics program that was once led by an executive who left the company amid accusations of sexual harassment
starting in the internet company spent tens of millions of dollars buying six robotics start ups in the united states and japan the project included two teams specializing in machines that looked and moved like humans in nod to google xe grand ambitions andy rubin the vice president of engineering who ran the effort called it replicant the term was originally used in the science fiction movie xe cblade runner xe
little came of it over the next few years google either sold off the companies it had acquired or shut them down the best known of the bunch boston dynamics was bought by the japanese conglomerate softbank and is still working on robots that move like humans or animals mr rubin left google in after the harassment allegations
google regrouped and reconsidered its focus on the mechanics of complex robots it has been rebuilding its program for the last few years with robots that are much more simple than the humanoid shaped machines that hung on the walls inside mr rubin xe lab
the new effort is called robotics at google it includes many of the engineers and researchers who worked under mr rubin and it is led by vincent vanhoucke principal scientist at google mr vanhoucke french born researcher was key figure in the development of google brain the company xe central artificial intelligence lab his team recently moved into new lab on google xe main campus in mountain view
the new york times was recently provided first look at some of the technology the company has been working on
while the machines may not be as eye catching as humanoid robots google researchers believe that the subtly more advanced technology inside them gives them more potential in the real world the company is developing ways for these robots to learn skills on their own like sorting through bin of unfamiliar objects or navigating warehouse filled with unexpected obstacles
google xe new lab is indicative of broader effort to bring so called machine learning to robotics researchers are exploring similar techniques at places like the university of california berkeley and openai the artificial intelligence lab founded by the silicon valley kingpins elon musk and sam altman in recent months both places have spawned start ups trying to commercialize their work
many believe that machine learning xe not extravagant new devices xe will be the key to developing robotics for manufacturing warehouse automation transportation and many other tasks
xe crobotics has long held the popular imagination but what is easily the most important change is the application of machine learning xe said sunil dhaliwal general partner with amplify partners silicon valley venture capital firm xe cthe utility is in the software xe
robots are already used in warehouses and on factory floors but they can handle only specific tasks like picking up particular object or turning screw google wants the machines it is working with to learn on their own
on recent afternoon inside google xe new lab robotic arm hovered over bin filled with ping pong balls wooden blocks plastic bananas and other random objects reaching into this pile of clutter the arm grabbed banana between two fingers and with gentle flick of the wrist tossed it into smaller bin several feet away
for robot it was remarkable trick when first presented with that pile of clutter the arm did not know how to pick up single object but equipped with camera that looked down into the bin the google system analyzed its own progress during about hours of trial and error
the arm eventually learned to toss items into the right bins about percent of the time when the researchers tried the same task their accuracy rate was about percent
it may sound simple enough but writing computer code to tell machine how to do that would be extremely difficult xe cit is learning more complicated things than could ever think about xe said shuran song one the primary researchers on the project
researchers believe these machines could work in warehouses and distribution centers run by companies like amazon and ups today humans sort through items that move in and out of distribution centers system like google xe could automate at least part of the process though it is unclear when it will be ready for commercial use amazon which has already deployed other kinds of robotics in its distribution centers is interested in this kind of technology
but many robotics experts warn that moving this kind of machine learning into the real world will be difficult technology that does well in the lab often breaks down inside distribution center because it can xe deal with unexpected objects it hasn xe seen before or tasks that require movements it has never tried
xe cthis is not the right solution for all problems xe said leif jentoft the chief executive of the massachusetts company righthand robotics and seasoned robotics researcher xe cthese technologies can sometimes seem more powerful than they are xe
in another corner of google xe lab researchers are training robotic hands to manipulate objects xe push pull and spin them in subtle ways
the three fingered hands are hardly complex at least in the physical sense the software helping them learn is the breakthrough and researchers hope the hands can eventually learn to use tools and other equipment
google is taking similar approach with all its robotic hardware the arm that tosses objects into bin is not an elaborate machine designed by google engineers built by universal robots it is commonly used for manufacturing and other tasks google is training it to do things it couldn xe otherwise do
xe clearning is actually helping us overcome the challenges of low cost robots xe said vikash kumar the google researcher who oversees this project
in third part of the lab researchers are training mobile robot sold by silicon valley start up fetch this rolling machine is learning to navigate unfamiliar spaces which can help in places like warehouses and factories
google is tight lipped about how it hopes to deploy the technologies it is working on but as with other forms of automation there is an obvious question of whether it will take away jobs
xe cit is hard to imagine future where that is not the case xe said michael chui partner with the mckinsey global institute business research organization
but other researchers believe the robots will complement human labor instead of replacing it
xe cthere are still so many jobs in the warehouse that robots can xe do xe said ken goldberg robotics professor at berkeley and one of the researchers behind ambidexterous robotics new start up xe cwhat they can do is assist with some of the drudgery xe

this article was reported and written in collaboration with propublica the nonprofit journalism organization
memorial sloan kettering cancer center has abruptly changed the focus of an annual fund raising campaign amid widening crisis that has already led to the resignation of its chief medical officer and sweeping re examination of its policies
the campaign initially titled xe charnessing big data xe was to have focused on the cancer center xe research into the use of artificial intelligence in cancer treatment according to brochure on memorial sloan kettering xe website
the move follows an article thursday by the new york times and propublica about an exclusive deal that memorial sloan kettering made with an artificial intelligence start up to use digital images of million tissue slides analyzed over decades the company paige ai was founded by three hospital insiders and also involved investors who were memorial sloan kettering board members
pathologists at the hospital complained that their work was being commercialized for private gain and that patients were not being informed that images of their tissue slides were being shared with an outside company the hospital and its officials said they did nothing wrong but acknowledged that they could have communicated better
kenneth manotti the cancer center xe senior vice president and chief development officer made reference to the article in an email sent friday to board members of the society of msk the hospital xe volunteer fund raising arm and an affiliated committee it said the fund raising effort which would have accelerated the center xe research on artificial intelligence would be postponed xe cunder the current circumstances as we navigate through the issues at hand xe
spokeswoman for memorial sloan kettering said tuesday that the society of msk would instead focus on patient care and would proceed the society xe annual campaign typically raises funds ranging from roughly to million for the hospital she said over all the society raised more than million year for memorial sloan kettering according to its annual reports
the change highlights the fund raising challenges faced by memorial sloan kettering which is one of the nation xe most prestigious cancer centers and recently completed billion multiyear fund raising drive earlier this month the hospital xe chief medical officer dr jos xc xa baselga resigned under fire after an article by the times and propublica revealed that he had failed to disclose his extensive industry ties in dozens of medical journal articles in recent years
at meetings and in online forums patients and staff members have expressed concern about the institution and the way in which it interacts with the health and pharmaceutical industries the hospital has announced task force to study its conflict of interest policies and said tuesday in note to the staff that it would hire an outside law firm to conduct xe cfocused review xe of unspecified concerns that had been raised internally the leaders said they believed the concerns were without merit
that uneasiness was reflected at staff meeting on thursday when pediatric neurologist told the leaders that she was little embarrassed about the institution even though she is spokeswoman for cycle for survival memorial sloan kettering charity that raises money for research she asked for advice on how to move on according to several attendees
dr craig thompson the hospital xe chief executive responded that it was important to focus on the cancer center xe dedication to treating cancer including the rare cancers that are the focus of cycle for survival according to the attendees cycle for survival raised million this year the hospital spokeswoman christine hickey said the cycle for survival event was already planned and would proceed
the fallout has led medical and academic experts to call for tighter disclosure rules on potential conflicts of interest in the cancer research fields and among major nonprofit organizations dr thompson and dr lisa deangelis acting physician in chief acknowledged the issue of low morale in an email to the staff on monday
xe cwe and our board are very aware of the disappointment and distress that many of you are experiencing after recent events at our center xe they said in the memo which was obtained from hospital staff members xe cwe share these concerns and are deeply sorry that you feel let down as your leaders we recognize that nothing is more important than maintaining the integrity and reputation of msk and its staff xe
fund raising can quickly dampen when charities sustain reputational hit said sophia shaw the co founder and managing partner of acorn advisors which advises nonprofits xe cthey xe re exactly like investors in for profit company xe ms shaw said of donors but rather than expecting return on investment donors are expecting return on the charity xe mission xe cif the donor doesn xe feel that their money is furthering that mission then they could be reluctant to give it away at that time xe
consultants for nonprofits said major donors were unlikely to be easily rattled by news reports but that could change depending on what happens next and how the hospital responds
xe cindividual funders xe and also foundations and corporations xe don xe like bad news xe said richard mittenthal president and chief executive of the tcc group which advises nonprofits xe cand when there xe bad news there xe always question of xe is there any more bad news xe

the triumph of christianity how forbidden religion swept the world by bart ehrman pp simon amp schuster
xe ci used to believe absolutely everything that bill just presented xe the scholar bart ehrman once said during debate with the conservative theologian william lane craig xe che and went to the same evangelical christian college wheaton where these things are taught xe xa used to believe them with my whole heart and soul used to preach them and try to convince others that they were true but then began xe xa looking at them deeply myself xe
ehrman in other words is no longer an evangelical or even christian although he xe written number of valuable books on the shortcomings of fundamentalist readings of scripture not every enemy of fundamentalism has approved on his popular blog ehrman has occasionally responded to personal attacks by the atheist crowd who do not share his considered equanimity in years he xe managed to write or edit more than books while also pausing to debate christology with stephen colbert
the field of new testament studies has never been reliable starting point for scholars seeking publishing superstardom one explanation for this is the subject matter itself true understanding of the forces that shaped christianity xe seemingly familiar but in fact highly arcane xe requires the ability to synthesize and express deep learning in dozen interlocking subjects ehrman who considers himself historian but has done extensive work in textual criticism has managed to achieve his remarkable renown by writing string of best sellers that skillfully mine and simplify his more scholarly work
that may sound pejorative but it xe not ehrman xe outreach to popular audience xe among whom happily include myself xe is wholly to the good if only because throughout history average christians have proved oddly unwilling to dig into the particularities of their faith beyond familiarizing themselves with few tentpole doctrines they share this reluctance with one of christianity xe most spectacular converts the roman emperor constantine who credited his victory at the milvian bridge in to the auspices of the christian deity despite not knowing much about christianity including the degree to which it was riven by sectarian disagreement the following year constantine co issued the edict of milan granting christians the right to practice their faith unmolested
in xe cthe triumph of christianity xe ehrman describes the edict of milan which was neither an edict nor written in milan as the western world xe first known government document to proclaim the freedom of belief at the time ehrman notes xe cchristianity probably made up to percent of the population of the roman empire xe mere hundred years later half the empire xe xe million inhabitants claimed allegiance to the christian tradition xe ehrman declares without hyperbole xe cthat is absolutely extraordinary xe
over the centuries countless books have been written to explain this great many of them by christian writers and scholars who take the constantinian view their faith xe unlikely triumph was and is proof of divine favor interestingly pagan advisers argued in vain to the first christian roman emperors that pagan beliefs had been what won the empire favor in the first place when the emperor valentinian ii removed the altar of the goddess victory from the roman senate house in for instance pagan statesman named symmachus reminded him xe cthis worship subdued the world xe
very little about the historical triumph of christianity makes sense when constantine converted the new testament didn xe formally exist and christians disagreed on basic theological concepts among them how jesus and god were related for those living at the time ehrman writes xe cit would have been virtually impossible to imagine that these christians would eventually destroy the other religions of rome xe some saw glimmers of danger however an otherwise unknown pagan philosopher named celsus wrote tract called xe con the true doctrine xe that attacked christians xe penchant for secrecy refusal to partake in public worship and naked appeals to xe cslaves women and little children xe
the great appeal of ehrman xe approach to christian history has always been his steadfast humanizing impulse in his superb book xe cthe orthodox corruption of scripture xe which concerns textual variants in early christian texts that were driven by theological agendas ehrman argues that these corruptions weren xe typically the product of willful obfuscation but rather the work of careful scribes trying to make sense of often perplexing language imagery and traditions ehrman always thinks hard about history xe winners and losers without valorizing the losers or demonizing the winners the losers here of course were pagan people
ehrman rejects the idea that constantine xe conversion made much difference the empire he writes would most likely have turned christian in time without him so how did christianity triumph to put it plainly christianity was something new on this earth it wasn xe closed to women it was so concerned with questions of social welfare healing the sick caring for the poor that it embedded them into its doctrines and while there were plenty of henotheist pagans that is people who worshiped one god while not denying the validity of others christianity went far beyond henotheism xe hesitant claim upon ultimate truth it was an exclusivist faith that foreclosed xe was designed to foreclose xe devotion to all other deities yet it was different from judaism which was just as exclusivist but crucially lacked missionary impulse
ehrman summarizing the argument of the social historian ramsay macmullen imagines crowd of pagans watching persuasive christian debate an equally persuasive adherent of the healing god asclepius xe cwhat happens to the overall relationship of inclusive paganism and exclusive christianity xe xa paganism has lost worshipers and gained no one whereas christianity has gained worshipers and lost no one xe thus christian believers go from roughly in to in to million in ehrman allows that these raw numbers may look xe cincredible but in fact they are simply the result of an exponential curve xe at certain point math took over mormonism which has been around less than years has seen comparable rates of growth
ehrman quotes valuable and moving letter from devout pagan named maximus which was written to augustine near the end of the fourth century xe cgod is the name common to all religions xe xa while we honor his parts so to speak separately xe xa we are clearly worshiping him in his entirety xe but when pagan intellectuals decided to confront christianity on its exclusivist terms xe xe cwe believe in one god as well xe xe they effectively stranded themselves on their own yard line the heart rending pagan inability to anticipate the complete erasure of their beliefs gave christianity one clear path to victory
and yet when the caliga was on the other foot christians had different opinions about religious oppression and compulsion many of christianity xe earliest apologists wrote of their longing to be left alone by the roman state here is tertullian xe cit is fundamental human right privilege of nature that everyone should worship according to his own convictions xe these christians xe cdevised xe ehrman writes somewhat cheekily xe cthe notion of the separation of church and state xe but when christians seized control of the empire the separation they had long argued for vanished the charges once lobbed against christians xe atheism superstition xe were turned against pagan people
ehrman is careful to note that for the most part there was no christian secret police forcing pagans to convert the empire was too large and diffusely governed to make such an effort feasible in addition xe cthere was no one moment when the world stopped being pagan to become christian xe rather it happened in the manner of hemingway xe theory of bankruptcy gradually then suddenly reading about how an entire culture xe precepts and traditions can be overthrown without anyone being able to stop it may not be heartening at this particular historical moment all the more reason to spend time in the company of such humane thoughtful and intelligent historian

each year millions of americans walk out of doctor xe office with misdiagnosis physicians try to be systematic when identifying illness and disease but bias creeps in alternatives are overlooked
now group of researchers in the united states and china has tested potential remedy for all too human frailties artificial intelligence
in paper published on monday in nature medicine the scientists reported that they had built system that automatically diagnoses common childhood conditions xe from influenza to meningitis xe after processing the patient xe symptoms history lab results and other clinical data
the system was highly accurate the researchers said and one day may assist doctors in diagnosing complex or rare conditions
drawing on the records of nearly chinese patients who had visited pediatric hospital over an month period the vast collection of data used to train this new system highlights an advantage for china in the worldwide race toward artificial intelligence
because its population is so large xe and because its privacy norms put fewer restrictions on the sharing of digital data xe it may be easier for chinese companies and researchers to build and train the xe cdeep learning xe systems that are rapidly changing the trajectory of health care
on monday president trump signed an executive order meant to spur the development of across government academia and industry in the united states as part of this xe camerican initiative xe the administration will encourage federal agencies and universities to share data that can drive the development of automated systems
pooling health care data is particularly difficult endeavor whereas researchers went to single chinese hospital for all the data they needed to develop their artificial intelligence system gathering such data from american facilities is rarely so straightforward
xe cyou have go to multiple places xe said dr george shih associate professor of clinical radiology at weill cornell medical center and co founder of md ai company that helps researchers label data for services xe cthe equipment is never the same you have to make sure the data is anonymized even if you get permission it is massive amount of work xe
after reshaping internet services consumer devices and driverless cars in the early part of the decade deep learning is moving rapidly into myriad areas of health care many organizations including google are developing and testing systems that analyze electronic health records in an effort to flag medical conditions such as osteoporosis diabetes hypertension and heart failure
similar technologies are being built to automatically detect signs of illness and disease in rays and eye scans
the new system relies on neural network breed of artificial intelligence that is accelerating the development of everything from health care to driverless cars to military applications neural network can learn tasks largely on its own by analyzing vast amounts of data
using the technology dr kang zhang chief of ophthalmic genetics at the university of california san diego has built systems that can analyze eye scans for hemorrhages lesions and other signs of diabetic blindness ideally such systems would serve as first line of defense screening patients and pinpointing those who need further attention
now dr zhang and his colleagues have created system that can diagnose an even wider range of conditions by recognizing patterns in text not just in medical images this may augment what doctors can do on their own he said
xe cin some situations physicians cannot consider all the possibilities xe he said xe cthis system can spot check and make sure the physician didn xe miss anything xe
the experimental system analyzed the electronic medical records of nearly patients at the guangzhou women and children xe medical center in southern china learning to associate common medical conditions with specific patient information gathered by doctors nurses and other technicians
first group of trained physicians annotated the hospital records adding labels that identified information related to certain medical conditions the system then analyzed the labeled data
then the neural network was given new information including patient xe symptoms as determined during physical examination soon it was able to make connections on its own between written records and observed symptoms
when tested on unlabeled data the software could rival the performance of experienced physicians it was more than percent accurate at diagnosing asthma the accuracy of physicians in the study ranged from to percent
in diagnosing gastrointestinal disease the system was percent accurate compared with the physicians xe accuracy of to percent
able to recognize patterns in data that humans could never identify on their own neural networks can be enormously powerful in the right situation but even experts have difficulty understanding why such networks make particular decisions and how they teach themselves
as result extensive testing is needed to reassure both doctors and patients that these systems are reliable
experts said extensive clinical trials are now needed for dr zhang xe system given the difficulty of interpreting decisions made by neural networks
xe cmedicine is slow moving field xe said ben shickel researcher at the university of florida who specializes in the use of deep learning for health care xe cno one is just going to deploy one of these techniques without rigorous testing that shows exactly what is going on xe
it could be years before deep learning systems are deployed in emergency rooms and clinics but some are closer to real world use google is now running clinical trials of its eye scan system at two hospitals in southern india
deep learning diagnostic tools are more likely to flourish in countries outside the united states dr zhang said automated screening systems may be particularly useful in places where doctors are scarce including in india and china
the system built by dr zhang and his colleagues benefited from the large scale of the data set gathered from the hospital in guangzhou similar data sets from american hospitals are typically smaller both because the average hospital is smaller and because regulations make it difficult to pool data from multiple facilities
dr zhang said he and his colleagues were careful to protect patients xe privacy in the new study but he acknowledged that researchers in china may have an advantage when it comes to collecting and analyzing this kind of data
xe cthe sheer size of the population xe the sheer size of the data xe is big difference xe he said

san francisco xe uber was ordered to suspend testing of its autonomous vehicles on arizona roads monday evening eight days after one of its cars struck and killed woman in tempe
state officials said the ride hailing service had failed to meet an expectation that it would prioritize public safety as it tested the technology
xe cthe incident that took place on march is an unquestionable failure to comply with this expectation xe gov doug ducey of arizona wrote in letter sent to dara khosrowshahi uber xe chief executive xe carizona must take action now xe
uber had already suspended all testing of its cars in arizona san francisco pittsburgh and toronto
xe cwe proactively suspended self driving operations in all cities immediately following the tragic incident last week we continue to help investigators in any way we can and we xe ll keep dialogue open with the governor xe office to address any concerns they have xe said matt kallman an uber spokesman
the rebuke from the governor is reversal from what has been an open arms policy by the state heralding its lack of regulation as an asset to lure autonomous vehicle testing xe and tech jobs waymo the self driving car company spun out from google and general motors owned cruise are also testing cars in the state
mr ducey said he was troubled by video released from the tempe police department that seemed to show that neither the uber safety driver nor the autonomous vehicle detected the presence of pedestrian in the road in the moments before the crash
the police said the car never slowed down before striking year old elaine herzberg who was pushing bicycle across the road the national transportation safety board which is investigating the crash with the local police has not yet ruled whether the company was at fault
the governor xe decision comes after the new york times reported that uber xe autonomous vehicles had struggled to meet company targets for reliability in the months leading up to crash

london xe one recent evening at london pub piotr mirowski stood in front of several dozen comedy fans to prove that an artificially intelligent computer program could perform improvised comedy
in one hand he held bug eyed toy robot its lines voiced by the program with the other he pretended to grip steering wheel the robot was playing mr mirowski xe partner they were taking scenic drive together
xe ci am not trying to be angry xe the robot said suddenly breaking the mood
xe ci don xe want you to be angry xe this is our quality time xe mr mirowski replied
xe ci xe sure that you will find love xe the robot said after an awkward pause drawing firm end to the couple xe relationship and prompting laughter from the audience xe ci xe so tired xe it added mr mirowski made final attempt to save things but the robot would not listen xe cyou are not me you xe re my friend xe it said emotionless
for someone who had just been dumped in front of paying audience mr mirowski looked happy why because the he created had worked and stuck to the topic at hand xe rare event he said later in an interview
for the past few years has been generating attention xe and alarm xe in many areas of arts and culture start ups and tech giants are developing systems that can write music for example while others are using the technology to generate art some fear these projects will put musicians and artists out of work
using computers to make comedy has received less attention but it has surprisingly long history in the early researchers at the university of edinburgh wrote program that could produce question based puns such as xe cwhat do you call good looking taxi handsome cab xe it xe csucceeds in generating pieces of text that are recognizably jokes but some of them are not very good jokes xe the researchers said in paper on the project
today around dozen people in europe and north america are working on similar projects mainly in their spare time from related jobs mr mirowski said he is senior research scientist working on artificial intelligence at google deepmind but said his work there was not related to comedy
mr mirowski was born in poland but spent most of his childhood in france playing role playing and video games he said he fell in love with improv at college both the challenge and playfulness of it and kept doing it after he graduated and started working in
he long thought of combining his passions but said he had only realized it was possible in partly because of systems that could quickly analyze large volumes of text spot patterns and then produce sentences in response mr mirowski decided to apply that to improv skits
the system he built was remarkably simple ex which stands for artificial language experiment has been fed the subtitles from more than films from action movies like xe cdeep impact xe to the pornographic film xe cdeep throat xe when someone talks to it the system uses tool called neural network vaguely modeled on the brain to analyze similar exchanges in its database and compose its own response
mr mirowski made his stage debut with ex in july it did not go to plan xe cthere was moment where it didn xe say anything as the speech recognition crashed xe mr mirowski said xe cso had to say xe see you want to stay silent xe that is something you can only really do once xe
around that time mr mirowski met kory mathewson an researcher at the university of alberta in canada who had developed comedy chatbot he was trying to use in live improv and the two began collaborating they have made numerous improvements to ex including tweaks to its code to make it better at sticking to topic if sketch is set on pirate ship you don xe want it to suddenly talk about space
ex is now at the point where the pair are happy for other improvisers to work with it in recent shows in london mr mirowski also used the system to feed performer lines through headset
despite all the improvements mr mirowski said working with an was still like having xe ccompletely drunk comedian xe on stage who was only xe caccidentally funny xe by saying things that were totally inappropriate overly emotional or plain odd
xe crobots are in way the antithesis of theater and comedy xe he said xe ctheatre is about the human expression on stage and it xe about the communication and empathy between the actors and the audience robots do not have the sensors to perceive any of that xe
what is good at mr mirowski said is saying unusual things that challenge the human improviser to work harder which can increase satisfaction when they manage to make scene work xe cimprov is like intellectual and mental tightrope walking xe he said xe cthe robot is kind of making the tightrope longer xe
in skype interview mr mathewson agreed that the joy of working with an system came when you managed to do show that didn xe just rely on the randomness of the responses for humor but which kept story going
his early shows were failures in that respect he said in one he swore in exasperation and the machine replied xe cswearing is often cathartic xe now he has improvised with it publicly more than times when shows are success they are more celebrations of human creativity than anything to do with he added
during the show on wednesday mr mirowski performed several different scenes using the none were anywhere near as successful as the one involving the couple going for drive the climax of the show involved four members of mr mirowski xe improv troupe improbotics ltd performing scene involving fictional president his chief of staff and an office cleaner
the audience had to guess which actor was controlled by the the answer became clear soon after the cleaner took to the stage xe ci xe communist xe she said completely out of the blue later she performed turn xe ci xe not communist xe she said then out of nowhere she asked another member of the troupe xe clook do you wanna buy knife xe
mr mirowski watched behind several laptops from the side of the stage he was smiling his was making no sense but it was getting laughs

the new work summit convened earlier this week by the new york times featured panel discussions about the opportunities and risks that are emerging as the use of artificial intelligence accelerates across industries here are some excerpts they have been edited and condensed
sam altman
co founder and chairman of open ai president of combinator
one of the things that surprises me most about sort of the criticism of the tech industry right now is belief that tech should be the one to decide what you can and can xe say and how these algorithms work and that to me sounds very bad think xe totally cool with for example restrictions on free speech where it xe hurting people and think we xe ve always had you know can xe yell xe cfire xe in this room so there xe always been free speech with an asterisk
but the idea that these companies who are not accountable to us or elected by us should get to decide sort of the new safeguards of society that seems like the wrong way to do it and think we should let our xe flawed as they may be xe democratically elected and enforced institutions update the rules for the world the world has changed lot tech has changed the world lot in very short time and it xe going to change it much more
evan spiegel
co founder and chief executive snap inc
for example just like newspaper page there really wasn xe personalized version of the internet years ago there was just one page that everyone got xe the same yahoo home page or something like that and so this idea that the internet could be personalized by your friends was huge breakthrough
but this also came with some side effects because the content that is distributed by your friends from all over the internet and that xe voted on by your friends in terms of likes and comments sometimes that means that xe because we xe re human beings and we click on things that are outrageous or offensive sometimes xe things that are negative actually spread faster and further than things that are positive
and so we very quickly saw media start to change to fit this new distribution mechanism that was based on what your friends were sharing so think if we look at the evolution of social media now people are thinking through sort of the ramifications of lot of what xe happened as result of that new wave distributing content but certainly think there xe lot of opportunity to sort of course correct here
john donovan
chief executive at amp communications
we paused for period of time before we went into deployment on robotics process automation machine learning to step back and build the ten commandments and we came back with think view that was human centric set of policies
and that is that everything in our business every outcome is owned by human being no one can say an algorithm did it or machine did it so everything that is launched algorithmically robotically is owned by human being machine can xe control machine without process that xe involved
these are like children algorithms if you change jobs you have to turn over to the new person that algorithm everything that xe put in has to have rewind button we have ph in psychology who makes sure that they have red button they can press when they feel like manipulation is happening in any way shape or form
so we put structure and process in place to make sure that what we do programmatically what we do algorithmically and what we do with machine doesn xe change the fundamentals of our accountability within the business
sebastian thrun
chief executive kitty hawk
look at as tool very much like shovel or kitchen knife and when it comes to ethics think there xe ethical ways to use kitchen knife and there xe unethical ways to use kitchen knife and they xe ve been around forever
what really is think that xe what people are somewhat divided on think it xe something very very simple first of all we talk about we talk about machine learning we don xe talk about real intelligence and machine learning is an innovation in computers
computers are dumb to make computers do the right thing in the past someone had to write down just an elaborate kitchen recipe of every possible step that the computer should do and the computer would blindly follow those rules the innovation in machine learning is that now instead of giving computer these rules you can give it examples
and the computer follows its own rules from those examples so computer programming has become easier as result children can now program computers by just giving examples the implications in my opinion are groundbreaking for society
kent walker
senior vice president global affairs and chief legal officer google
the tech sector has always had lots of different regulations from privacy to copyright to safe harbors and the like we xe re fans of regulation when it xe smart regulation
and what do mean by that so regulation that starts out with really crisp definition of what xe the problem you xe re trying to solve that is then narrowly tailored to solve that problem and minimize blowback and side effects and then third thoughtful analysis of how what the second and third implications of those rules might be
when you apply that to artificial intelligence think it xe most likely that we will start with the applications it xe rare that you regulate basic research because there xe so much risk of deterring innovation that could be really incredibly productive along the lines that sebastian was talking about
but as you get into applications xe whether it xe financial services or health care or agricultural productivity xe we already have thoughtful series of laws and rules around that and it would be natural to expand those into the issues that are raised by
deep nishar
senior managing partner softbank vision fund
so you start at national level and say xe cwhat should the new age curriculum look like xe started my work career in the heartland of america it used to be an apprenticeship business you worked in factories you got trained by other people who were good at it then you got paid more and you became good at it and you trained other people behind you
well then companies should be training us to do similar things and retraining us my father xe generation you had one profession one job our generation you have perhaps one or two professions multiple jobs our children xe generation is going to have multiple professions multiple jobs that xe the reality you know we can keep fighting that reality but it xe here to stay
adena friedman
president and chief executive nasdaq
we always hired people into skilled positions that they had mastery in whether it was market structure or computer science or whatever it was and we didn xe really have whole program of developing talent from within the organization
today that xe huge part of what we xe re doing so we have lot of university programs we have whole internship program we do all sorts of really fun projects over the summer where people have tangible work product at the end of it that we actually then deploy inside our shop
and it xe very different way of bringing in would say deep intelligence and intellectual curiosity and energy and new way of thinking and working that then you can kind of integrate into the organization and they developed their mastery by being part of who we are and we teach them market structure mean smart person can learn market structure but market structure is something they can then take through their entire career
dov seidman
founder and chief executive lrn
the world has gone from interconnected to interdependent we xe ve never risen and fallen together the way we do today the behaviors plights hopes aspirations and actions of any one person are experienced viscerally and visually and directly in tiny screens in our hands
it xe not just migration patterns with one swipe strangers are coming into intimate proximity on an accelerated basis and into our homes and into our cars we are not just raying institutions we are looking deep into their innermost workings and into the mind sets and character of those in charge with vision and we don xe always like what we see and we xe re amplifying it on social media for everybody else to spread for crimination and then these unprecedented forces are asking us not just about how products are designed and how they xe re being used but they xe re asking us to confront the most fundamental moral question of our time what does it mean to be human in the age of intelligent machines when we no longer share the planet with inferior mammals we no longer have monopoly on intelligence what makes us special and unique
that is moral question submit to you that the business of business is no longer just business the business of business is now society taking responsibility in this context as inescapable and how you take responsibility is now new source of competitive advantage believe that we are in profound moral moment
cindy mi

in founded vipkid with the simple idea that every child deserves global classroom with global teachers and global content of online personalized learning style so every day we xe re not literally shuttling our teachers xe we xe re teleporting them to our global classrooms to their students in china and beyond
vipkid today has provided new work opportunities for over north american teachers the size of football stadium so this is really important because all of our teachers come from all states in the united states and all provinces and territories in canada
ashton carter
director belfer center for science and international affairs harvard kennedy school th secretary of defense
we have seen cases where technology is leading us to dark place and even as that can happen in the department of defense it can happen elsewhere and in fact it xe happening in my judgment much more prevalently out there when it has to do with the rest of people xe lives and their quality of life and their privacy and the way they are led to behave with respect to their fellow citizens and so forth that xe sadly rampant
that xe one of the themes of this conference feel in my new life that is my crusade technology and public purpose is the issue of our time whether it xe in digital or biotech jobs and training we can xe have good and cohesive society if we don xe get on top of that so of course worry about it
dave limp
senior vice president amazon devices and services
grew up in world where always had television and my parents didn xe so television xe always been my new normal it was learned behavior for them
have children and you can imagine our house uses alexa in lot of ways and when they go to their friend xe house for sleepover or for visit and they say xe calexa turn on the lights xe and it doesn xe work they xe re stunned because it xe their new normal they expect that to work works in every room of our house
but it xe not one demographic that it xe taking off with you know certainly kids love it but would say that at least once week often every day get an email from somebody that alexa and echo have changed their lives because they might not have all their mobility they might be little elderly
and they find companionship with alexa they find the ability to interact in ways they couldn xe before
reid hoffman
co founder and executive chairman linkedin partner greylock partners
do think that over time we will see kind of transformation of industry xe an enormous change in where the bulk of people find jobs and employment the first worry is what will that transition look like
even though the move from the agricultural to industrial age unlocked the productivity that created the middle class that created all this prosperity education learning and science xe and think we have the same similar potential now xe that intervening transition is super painful and we want not as much suffering as we saw in the transition to the industrial age
lawrence summers
charles eliot university professor and president emeritus harvard university st secretary of the treasury
automation and technology have been affecting our economy forever people talk about this like it xe something that xe coming in the future in between and percent of american men between the ages of and were not working today about percent of american men between the ages of and are not working xe almost three times as many even though we xe re at business cycle peak
there are many reasons for that but an important part of it is that technology has been able to substitute for the kinds of work that many of them do making the rewards to them for working much less and causing many more people to choose not to work
brad smith
president microsoft
one thing we have said is that we will provide our technology to democratically elected governments that broadly focus on the protection of human rights
we will do that because we want these governments to have access to technology we believe they need to have access to technology but we also recognize that there are important ethical issues that will arise and we will use our voice as corporate citizen to not just actively xe but proactively xe engage on the issues of the day
but where we don xe think that technology companies are rightly in the business of regulating democratically elected governments we think democratically elected governments should be in the business of regulating technology companies xe not the other way around

san francisco xe uber xe robotic vehicle project was not living up to expectations months before self driving car operated by the company struck and killed woman in tempe ariz
the cars were having trouble driving through construction zones and next to tall vehicles like big rigs and uber xe human drivers had to intervene far more frequently than the drivers of competing autonomous car projects
waymo formerly the self driving car project of google said that in tests on roads in california last year its cars went an average of nearly miles before the driver had to take control from the computer to steer out of trouble as of march uber was struggling to meet its target of miles per xe cintervention xe in arizona according to pages of company documents obtained by the new york times and two people familiar with the company xe operations in the phoenix area but not permitted to speak publicly about it
yet uber xe test drivers were being asked to do more xe going on solo runs when they had worked in pairs
and there also was pressure to live up to goal to offer driverless car service by the end of the year and to impress top executives dara khosrowshahi uber xe chief executive was expected to visit arizona in april and leaders of the company xe development group in the phoenix area wanted to give him glitch free ride in an autonomous car mr khosrowshahi xe trip was called xe cmilestone confidence xe in the company documents
tech companies like uber waymo and lyft as well as automakers like general motors and toyota have spent billions developing self driving cars in the belief that the market for them could one day be worth trillions of dollars
the crash which occurred sunday night was major setback for uber which has been trying to improve its image since mr khosrowshahi replaced travis kalanick as the company xe chief executive in messy transfer of power last august in february uber also settled longstanding legal fight with waymo
the death of woman who was struck by an autonomous car operated by uber is believed to be the first pedestrian fatality associated with self driving technology newly released video offers clues about what happened
on monday uber halted autonomous car tests in arizona pittsburgh san francisco and toronto it is not clear when the company will revive them
the tempe police department said it was investigating the crash and has not determined whether the car was at fault volvo xc sport utility vehicle equipped with uber xe sensing technology struck elaine herzberg while it was going miles an hour in mile an hour zone according to the police the car with one safety driver and operating in autonomous mode did not slow down before impact
video shot from the vehicle xe dashboard camera showed the safety driver looking down away from the road it also appeared that the driver xe hands were not hovering above the steering wheel which is what drivers are instructed to do so they can quickly retake control of the car ms herzberg pushing bicycle across the street appeared in the camera right before she was hit
xe cas we develop self driving technology safety is our primary concern every step of the way xe said matt kallman an uber spokesman xe cwe xe re heartbroken by what happened this week and our cars remain grounded we continue to assist investigators in any way we can xe
uber has been testing its self driving cars in regulatory vacuum in arizona there are few federal rules governing the testing of autonomous cars unlike california where uber had been testing since spring of arizona state officials had taken hands off approach to autonomous vehicles and did not require companies to disclose how their cars were performing
waymo and cruise self driving car company owned by gm reported their xe cintervention xe numbers to california regulators uber xe goals in arizona were mentioned in internal documents xe arizona does not have reporting requirements xe and it has not been testing self driving cars in california long enough to be required to report them
uber xe first road tests in its self driving car effort code named project roadrunner were actually in pittsburgh in september the phoenix area was added year ago and quickly became the company xe main testing ground with employees and more than autonomous cars driving local roads because of favorable regulatory environment favorable weather conditions xe according to company document
when mr khosrowshahi took over as uber xe chief executive he had considered shutting down the self driving car operations according to two other people familiar with mr khosrowshahi xe thinking
but he became convinced that it was important to uber xe long term prospects his visit to phoenix was seen by the arizona team as critical opportunity to demonstrate their progress according to the people familiar with the company xe operations in the phoenix area they wanted to take him on ride without human interventions to demonstrate that the cars could handle so called edge cases tricky road situations that are hard to predict
xe cwith autonomy the edge cases kill you so you xe ve got to build out for all the edge cases xe mr khosrowshahi said at conference in november xe cwhich makes it very very difficult problem xe
by september uber xe autonomous cars had driven one million miles in year nationwide uber tallied its second million in days and added its next million at an even faster clip according to company documents
early on in phoenix there were two groups of test drivers smaller group xe cstressed xe the cars by putting them in challenging situations where without human intervention they would have crashed
larger group of drivers was focused on picking up customers in the autonomous vehicles those drivers were expected to pay more attention to little details often taking control to prevent xe cbad experience xe like hard braking according to company document
around october uber merged the two groups to get to point where it could offer truly driverless car service to customers xe cas quickly as possible xe the customer pickup service was mostly dropped so drivers could focus on accumulating miles and gathering data to help the system become more reliable
around the same time uber moved from two employees in every car to one the paired employees had been splitting duties xe one ready to take over if the autonomous system failed and another to keep an eye on what the computers were detecting the second person was responsible for keeping track of system performance as well as labeling data on laptop computer mr kallman the uber spokesman said the second person was in the car for purely data related tasks not safety
waymo had also moved from two operators at all times to one in some situations in late said johnny luu waymo spokesman waymo still uses two test drivers when it is adding new systems or moving to new location
but uber xe autonomous cars are not operating nearly as well as those of its competitors cruise reported to california regulators that it went more than miles per intervention after its strong california results waymo is now testing cars in chandler ariz phoenix suburb with no safety drivers
mr kallman said miles per intervention was not measure of safety but rate of system improvement that could differ depending on where and how the cars were driven
when uber moved to single operator some employees expressed safety concerns to managers according to the two people familiar with uber xe operations they were worried that going solo would make it harder to remain alert during hours of monotonous driving mr kallman said it delayed the start of its single driver initiative to allow for more training and to make sure drivers felt comfortable for the new role
uber also developed an app mounted on an ipad in the car xe middle console for drivers to alert engineers to problems drivers could use the app anytime without shifting the car out of autonomous mode often drivers would annotate data at traffic light or stop but many did so while the car was moving said the two people familiar with uber xe operations mr kallman said it designed the app to meet government safety guidelines for in car software to minimize distractions
waymo had different solution when it moved to single safety driver it added button on the steering wheel for drivers to create an audio explanation when they took the car out of autonomous mode
not all drivers followed uber xe training one was fired after falling asleep at the wheel and being spotted by colleague another was spotted air drumming as the autonomous car passed through an intersection according to the two people familiar with uber xe operations
uber was planning to seek regulatory approval by december to start self driving car service in arizona according to company documents uber said the vehicles would have to be safer than human drivers before they would commercialize it they would not operate around the clock and would stop for bad weather or traffic and the service did not need to prove xe clonger term financial viability xe
already one milestone will be missed mr khosrowshahi will not travel to phoenix next month because of scheduling problems that came up before the crash mr kallman said but it is unclear how the crash will ultimately affect uber xe plans for autonomous vehicles
xe cthe collection of bad news around uber creates reputation in people xe minds xe said michael ramsey an automotive analyst at gartner xe cevery other company would get black eye too but they might be forgiven for uber it xe going to be hard to shake xe

michael ferro jr chicago entrepreneur and the biggest shareholder in the newspaper publisher tronc has stepped down as the company xe chairman tronc announced on monday hours before the publication of report in which two women accused him of inappropriate sexual advances
justin dearborn the company xe chief executive will replace mr ferro as chairman the move was made just weeks after mr ferro helped negotiate the sale of tronc xe crown jewel the los angeles times
xe ci am confident that under the leadership of justin and the rest of the board and management team tronc will continue to deliver value for investors while executing the plan for digital transformation xe mr ferro said in statement
later on monday fortune magazine published an article in which two women made separate on the record accusations that mr ferro had acted inappropriately toward them during private encounters neither woman worked for mr ferro though they said their interactions with him had been for professional reasons
xe cover more than years of leading public companies and other enterprises michael ferro has never had claim filed against him nor settlement made on his behalf xe mr ferro xe spokesman dennis culloton said in statement to fortune that was later sent to the new york times xe cyour on the record allegations appear to involve private conduct with private individuals who were not employees of tronc or any other company he ran
xe cas recently announced mr ferro has retired back to private life after leading financial turnaround of tronc as the non executive chairman xe the statement continued xe cthere will therefore be no other comment xe
mr ferro will remain an investor in tronc and through another one of his companies merrick ventures will maintain consulting position that will pay him million year through
mr ferro resigned after period of intense public scrutiny dissatisfaction at the los angeles times spilled into public view early this year with some employees at the paper fearing that tronc and mr ferro were making hires in order to try to form separate unit that would sidestep newsroom that had recently unionized
also ross levinsohn who had been consulting for tronc before becoming the publisher of the times was placed on leave after national public radio reported that he had been accused of sexual harassment at two previous jobs after an investigation that tronc said had found no wrongdoing mr levinsohn was reinstated as chief executive of newly formed division called tribune interactive
in early february mr ferro orchestrated the sale of the los angeles times to patrick soon shiong billionaire doctor in los angeles for million the deal which is expected to close soon also included the times xe sibling paper the san diego union tribune and smaller publications in the california news group
xe cmichael retires having created considerable shareholder value for the company in just two years as chairman of the board xe mr dearborn said in statement
mr coulton the spokesman for mr ferro said mr ferro was xe cburned out xe by his high profile and wanted to xe cgo out on win xe but that was before the accusations against mr ferro became public
an audacious businessman and former owner of the chicago sun times mr ferro became tronc xe nonexecutive chairman in early after his fund merrick ventures invested million in the company
almost immediately he began to transform tronc the publisher of the los angeles times the chicago tribune the baltimore sun and other newspapers sometimes to the bewilderment of its journalists and the rest of the media industry
during lengthy takeover battle with gannett the publisher of usa today mr ferro changed the company xe name from tribune publishing to tronc for tribune online content move that was met with ridicule on the internet he also introduced technology driven approach to journalism that included the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning and he harbored global ambitions with plans to open bureaus for the los angeles times in cities around the world including lagos nigeria and rio de janeiro
in september tronc acquired the daily news the nearly year old tabloid that was long voice for new york xe working class
nowhere did tronc xe decisions draw more criticism than at the los angeles times last year the company aggressively tried to thwart unionization effort by the paper xe workers aggravating tension between employees and management the company also installed new leaders including mr levinsohn former yahoo executive and lewis xe vorkin previously the chief product officer at forbes who became the paper xe editor neither endeared himself to newsroom that became set on their ousters
newsroom employees at the times also made public online reports about tronc including the compensation and perks received by executives as well as mr ferro xe use of private jet that tronc had paid to sublease from merrick ventures regulatory disclosure in december that tronc had agreed to pay merrick ventures million annually on rolling three year basis for consulting services also vexed employees
last week tronc laid off number of employees at the chicago tribune including its only reporter in washington leaving the paper without correspondent in the nation xe capital as part of the sale of the los angeles times tronc sold its washington bureau to dr soon shiong

san francisco xe in geoffrey hinton doubled down on his pursuit of technological idea called neural network
it was way for machines to see the world around them recognize sounds and even understand natural language but scientists had spent more than years working on the concept of neural networks and machines couldn xe really do any of that
backed by the canadian government dr hinton computer science professor at the university of toronto organized new research community with several academics who also tackled the concept they included yann lecun professor at new york university and yoshua bengio at the university of montreal
on wednesday the association for computing machinery the world xe largest society of computing professionals announced that drs hinton lecun and bengio had won this year xe turing award for their work on neural networks the turing award which was introduced in is often called the nobel prize of computing and it includes million prize which the three scientists will share
over the past decade the big idea nurtured by these researchers has reinvented the way technology is built accelerating the development of face recognition services talking digital assistants warehouse robots and self driving cars dr hinton is now at google and dr lecun works for facebook dr bengio has inked deals with ibm and microsoft
xe cwhat we have seen is nothing short of paradigm shift in the science xe said oren etzioni the chief executive officer of the allen institute for artificial intelligence in seattle and prominent voice in the community xe chistory turned their way and am in awe xe
loosely modeled on the web of neurons in the human brain neural network is complex mathematical system that can learn discrete tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data by analyzing thousands of old phone calls for example it can learn to recognize spoken words
this allows many artificial intelligence technologies to progress at rate that was not possible in the past rather than coding behavior into systems by hand xe one logical rule at time xe computer scientists can build technology that learns behavior largely on its own
the london born dr hinton first embraced the idea as graduate student in the early time when most artificial intelligence researchers turned against it even his own ph adviser questioned the choice
xe cwe met once week xe dr hinton said in an interview xe csometimes it ended in shouting match sometimes not xe
neural networks had brief revival in the late and early after year of postdoctoral research with dr hinton in canada the paris born dr lecun moved to at amp xe bell labs in new jersey where he designed neural network that could read handwritten letters and numbers an at amp subsidiary sold the system to banks and at one point it read about percent of all checks written in the united states
though neural network could read handwriting and help with some other tasks it could not make much headway with big tasks like recognizing faces and objects in photos identifying spoken words and understanding the natural way people talk
xe cthey worked well only when you had lots of training data and there were few areas that had lots of training data xe dr lecun said
but some researchers persisted including the paris born dr bengio who worked alongside dr lecun at bell labs before taking professorship at the university of montreal
in with less than in funding from the canadian institute for advanced research dr hinton created research program dedicated to what he called xe cneural computation and adaptive perception xe he invited dr bengio and dr lecun to join him
by the end of the decade the idea had caught up with its potential in dr hinton and his students helped microsoft ibm and google push the boundaries of speech recognition then they did much the same with image recognition
xe che is genius and knows how to create one impact after another xe said li deng former speech researcher at microsoft who brought dr hinton xe ideas into the company
dr hinton xe image recognition breakthrough was based on an algorithm developed by dr lecun in late facebook hired the professor to build research lab around the idea dr bengio resisted offers to join one of the big tech giants but the research he oversaw in montreal helped drive the progress of systems that aim to understand natural language and technology that can generate fake photos that are indistinguishable from the real thing
though these systems have undeniably accelerated the progress of artificial intelligence they are still very long way from true intelligence but drs hinton lecun and bengio believe that new ideas will come
xe cwe need fundamental additions to this toolbox we have created to reach machines that operate at the level of true human understanding xe dr bengio said

bots artificial intelligence and social media algorithms are shaping the fate of humanity at startling pace at what point is control lost and the creations take over how about now

contributing opinion writer
try to imagine the last minutes of lion air flight in october the plane is new machine boeing xe sleek and intelligent max fitted with an advanced electronic brain after takeoff this cyberpilot senses that something is wrong with the angle of ascent and starts to force the jetliner down
tug of war follows between men and computer at miles an hour xe the human pilots trying to right the downward plunge the automatic pilot taking it back from them the bot wins the jetliner crashes into the java sea all onboard are killed
and here xe the most agonizing part the killer was supposed to save lives it was smart computer designed to protect gravity defiance machine from error it lacks judgment and intuition precisely because those human traits can sometimes be fatal in guiding an aerodynamic tube through the sky
we still don xe know the exact reason the pilots of that fatal flight couldn xe disable the smart system and return to manual control it looks as if the sensors were off instigating the downward spiral report by the federal aviation administration in found that percent of accidents over decade were linked to confusion between pilots and automated systems
but it xe not too much of reach to see flight as representative of the hinge in history we xe ve arrived at xe with the bots the artificial intelligence and the social media algorithms now shaping the fate of humanity at startling pace
like the correction system in the these inventions are designed to make life easier and safer xe or at least more profitable for the owners and they do for the most part the overall idea is to outsource certain human functions the drudgery and things prone to faulty judgment while retaining master control the question is at what point is control lost and the creations take over how about now
it was exactly years ago that mary shelley published story of monster who is still very much with us her book xe cfrankenstein xe is about the consequences of man playing god you can see permutations of the monster not unsympathetic patchwork of human parts in characters like dolores the host who rebels in the television series xe cwestworld xe
shelley xe concerns were raised at the peak of the industrial revolution when the western world was transformed from sleepy agricultural societies into frenetic age of factories machines and overcrowded cities all the helpful inventions also produced mass dislocation life killing pollution child labor and xe as per the invention of the cotton gin in the american south xe an expansion of human enslavement
today we are close to creating human brain inside computer xe an entirely new species in his book xe csapiens xe yuval noah harari takes us through mostly upbeat tour of humanity since the cognitive revolution of years ago at the end of the book xe our time xe he warns about the new being the cyborg now taking shape in lab near you
the of microsoft satya nadella hit similar cautionary note at the company xe recent annual shareholder meeting big tech he said should be asking xe cnot what computers can do but what they should do xe
it xe the xe ccan do xe part that should scare you facebook once all puppies baby pictures and high school reunion updates is monster of misinformation and facebook xe creator is more clueless than dr frankenstein about the dangers of what he has unleashed on the world
mark zuckerberg facebook xe has glibly assured us that building advanced artificial intelligence systems will root out the hate speech lies and propaganda passed among the two billion active users of facebook but fake news xe whether gossip shared by family members or the toxic kind spread by russians in basements xe is the mother xe milk of facebook the may only make it easier for mass manipulation in that sense facebook is headed for its own crash into the sea
driverless cars will soon be available for ride sharing in the united states if they can reduce the carnage on the roads xe more than million people killed and four billion injured worldwide since the dawn of the auto age xe this will be good thing except that this year bot car killed woman in crosswalk in arizona and others have been slower than humans to react there shouldn xe be any rush xe except from the profit drivers at the ride sharing companies xe to hand over the steering wheel to driver without heartbeat
it xe not luddite to see the be careful what you wish for lesson from mary shelley xe era to our own at the cusp of an age of technological totalitarianism nor is it luddite to ask for more screening more ethical considerations more projections of what can go wrong as we surrender judgment reason and oversight to our soulless creations
as haunting as those final moments inside the cockpit of flight were it xe equally haunting to grasp the full meaning of what happened the system overrode the humans and killed everyone our invention our folly

china will succeed in building powerful technology industry that will rival the united states even if president trump starts trade war to stop it the reason can be found on the fourth floor of nondescript factory in city once famous for cheap manufacturing and prostitution
this factory floor in the southern chinese city of dongguan once employed what one employee called xe cmagnificent sea of people xe rising labor costs and new generation with little interest in toiling in factories forced new tack now the sea of people is being replaced by whirring array of boxy machines each performing work it used to take people steps to finish
the factory suggests that beijing xe vision of made in china xe the ambitious state driven plan to retool china xe industries to compete in areas like automation microchips and self driving cars xe is not being pushed just by the communist party xe top leaders instead the drive is also coming from the bottom up from the businesses and cities across china that know they must modernize or perish
the trump administration is not wrong to confront beijing over made in china china xe top down approach gives its companies unfair advantages and could continue to roil global trade relations long after mr trump retires to mar lago
but made in china is also being propelled by businesses like dongguan mentech optical amp magnetic company the owner of the factory which are worried about labor costs and their own futures it comes from local governments looking for ways to stay relevant it comes from growing network of private sector entrepreneurs academics and local politicians who are increasingly working together to overhaul china xe factories and its future other cities xe suzhou wenzhou xuzhou and the industrial areas around shanghai are just few examples xe have also drummed up their own automation plans
the modernization may not happen in in fact it may be long after that but china will get there mostly because it has to
xe cif made in china were car the engine has started and it xe definitely moving along xe said zhang guojun director of guangdong intelligent robotics institute in dongguan one of several city supported local research centers helping the factories upgrade the city was automating well before made in china came out in he said xe cbut the policy provided us clear direction xe
city of eight million people in the pearl river delta dongguan long relied on making and exporting shoes toys and electronic parts to the united states and europe in many ways it looks like the factory dominated china of popular imagination with whole parts of the city pervaded by rows of rectangular factory buildings one after another
then the financial crisis hit orders dried up dongguan became known as china xe capital of prostitution until government crackdown cleaned it up
beyond the financial crisis china xe very prosperity threatened dongguan xe future the average worker xe income rose fourfold over the past decade fewer young people wanted to work on dull and stressful assembly lines preferring service jobs xe like waiting tables and delivering commerce packages xe that let them interact with people or move around some factories moved to lower cost countries or shut down for good
dongguan xe companies and government had to do something they committed to modernizing
before made in china became policy dongguan kicked off xe creplacing humans with machines initiative xe and funded it with about million year it later channeled more money into other automation initiatives companies that could prove they had worthy research project or were willing to invest in industrial robots software or advanced machinery could win subsidies and tax breaks the government picked up percent to percent of the tab smartphone furniture machinery and even cake companies won support official documents show
mentech the telecom equipment supplier once had hundreds of workers winding packaging and testing magnetic wires that were thinner than hair all by hand even today the company is desperate for workers on the side of one factory building it lists the on the job benefits it offers monthly wages with overtime of up to about air conditioned dormitories free wi fi and even birthday present
xe clove your employees xe reads banner xe cand they will love you back times xe
but labor costs and lack of hands were holding it back during the lunar new year holiday when most of china shuts down and goes home some mentech executives engineers and administrative staff had to work three hour shifts after their normal workday to keep the factory running said zhang xiaodong research and development manager
mentech asked mr zhang and others to figure out how to automate the factory they spent two years working late into the night machines needed tweaking components needed to be redesigned so that machines could make them several projects failed
xe cnot every problem has solution xe mr zhang said xe cwe know that smart manufacturing is the future but getting there isn xe easy xe
today factory floor that once needed over workers now needs more than half of the factory has been automated the workers clustered around the machines will probably be replaced by machines themselves in year or two
to help the dongguan government provided million in subsidies it is also luring start ups and helping scientists open research centers to provide more know how
one start up aiding mentech is dongguan precision intelligent technology which will provide good chunk of the machinery the company needs to automate fully because the equipment will be chinese made it will be cheaper than purchases of automation systems from japan or the united states
xe cthe biggest trend in manufacturing is that automation is irreversible xe said forest tian former venture capitalist who founded precision intelligent technology xe cthere will be huge demand for these machines xe
the dongguan government has taken other steps to ensure these centers of innovation help local manufacturers for example it formed about research institutes in partnership with major chinese universities once the initial money was given dongguan officials told the institutes they had to figure out how to make money on their own
the institutes teamed up with companies like guangdong janus intelligent group corporation once dowdy cellphone parts maker facing the familiar problem of high labor costs experts in the field became recurring visitors to its factory
xe cwe call it buddhas coming to dongguan xe said huang he the head of janus xe smart factory business alluding to the followers of the original buddha
at janus factory rows of automated machine tools work with robotic arms and green conveyor belts in space nearly the size of football field the robotic arms feed metal blocks to the machines which then punch grind and wash them the housings for phones and tablets come out
the factory requires workers on shift instead of before it was automated the robotic arms are made in china
no doubt many chinese companies will fail in their effort to upgrade made in china xe other goals such as building up world class microchip industries or self driving cars remain out of sight for now
yet when it comes to manufacturing dongguan suggests made in china will succeed partly because the effort is bigger than beijing chinese companies and local government officials are determined to climb the value chain so they will not fall into obsolescence the best washington can do is to make sure its policies help american companies stay ahead of the game

euan robertson started his job with new york city xe economic development team at an ominous moment it was monday sept the day lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy and ignited the financial crisis
mr robertson made his way through city hall xe sprawling open office to conference table where he huddled with top advisers to mayor michael bloomberg
xe cno one knew what was going to happen or how bad it would be xe mr robertson recalled xe cbut everyone agreed we xe better come up with plan xe
the plan that emerged called for developing tech start ups and tech workers in new york the goal mr robertson said was to xe cbuild talent engine xe that would help make the city magnet for coders and companies
decade later there is ample evidence that the city is well on its way to achieving that goal amazon xe sudden decision last week to abandon its plan to build big campus in queens in the face of protests from some local politicians and community activists is setback xe but not one that reverses tech xe climb in the city
amazon already employs workers in new york and the city xe talent pool was the main reason the company said that it selected new york in november in december google announced major expansion that could double its new york work force to over the next decade without the rich government incentives that proved lightning rod for the amazon deal
today the city is home to thousands of fledgling companies and the new york region regularly ranks second to the bay area in attracting venture capital the lifeblood of the start up economy the city xe tech sector has become wellspring of jobs paying more than on average major part of the local economy
the story of tech xe ascent in new york stretches back nearly two decades it was bumpy path with progress both by design and serendipity doubleclick survivor of the dot com crash and digital advertising pioneer and google which made an early bet on the city played key roles and the bloomberg administration also made smart policy moves
but tech in new york took hold mainly because entrepreneurs technologists and corporations chose the city as the place to work and live just as the city xe industries were undergoing digital transformations according to interviews with more than two dozen people who contributed to the city xe evolution into tech center
xe cthe truth is we caught wave xe said seth pinsky the president of the new york city economic development corporation from to
many of the city xe tech jobs are not in technology companies instead they are tied to industries where the city has long been positioned as world leader xe like finance advertising and media those businesses face threats from the rise of the digital age and have adapted to compete helping to revitalize the city xe economy in the process there are twice as many technology jobs in non tech industries in new york as there are in technology companies according to emsi labor market research firm
in terms of economic political and cultural impact the finance industry dominates but tech is gaining fast and is where much of the growth is
new york xe confidential proposal to amazon code named project clancy which is filled with detailed data on the city work force and labor market points to the change amazon asked for example which companies had the most job openings in machine learning fundamental artificial intelligence skill the top four according to the proposal were jpmorgan chase goldman sachs citigroup and kpmg tied for fifth place were amazon and google
read more for the labor movement tech giants present quandary
skilled tech workers now flock to new york from everywhere but the homegrown talent engine that city officials sought to jump start decade ago is also revving up the new cornell tech graduate school campus on roosevelt island product of the city xe development plan has students with expansion plans for student population of over the next two decades and new courses buildings and research institutes are underway at columbia new york university and the city university of new york
and they are being lured by urban amenities xe museums theater opera dance jazz clubs art galleries bars and restaurants xe that offer clear alternative to life in suburban silicon valley
xe cthe main resource in technology is smart people xe said kevin ryan longtime tech entrepreneur xe cthe new york tech sector is succeeding largely because new york is succeeding xe
anyone designing hardware writing code or using computer or smartphone today owes debt to the innovations developed in metropolitan new york decades ago the first widely adopted programming language fortran was created in by young coders working for ibm in an office on east th street their wintertime breaks were snowball fights in central park researchers at bell labs located first in manhattan and then suburban new jersey invented the transistor the unix operating system and the and programming languages xe building blocks of modern computing
technology innovation eventually migrated outside new york minicomputer makers sprang up in the boston suburbs but the larger move was westward beginning in the late when first the semiconductor business and later the personal computer industry took root in sunny northern california
the internet boom opened the door to new york entrepreneurs especially in the field of new media with ventures like feed and suck popular web magazines start ups clustered in the flatiron district of manhattan an area known as silicon alley
when theglobe com an early social media website went public in late its shares soared more than percent record at the time theglobe com like so many start ups in silicon alley and silicon valley collapsed when the dot com bubble burst couple of years later
amid the dot com meltdown though there was contrarian bet on the city unnoticed at the time by fledgling start up google
in the late summer of timothy armstrong at qualified as an internet veteran mr armstrong helped create or became senior manager at string of ventures and had solid track record in internet sales and marketing when he met with omid kordestani head of sales at google
the company was looking to expand and mr kordestani arranged meeting between mr armstrong and its founders larry page and sergey brin in silicon valley
the thinking at google mr armstrong recalled was little more than that the company wanted big advertising business and new york was where the ad money was he signed one page contract with no guarantees
xe cthe idea was if it doesn xe work out no harm no foul xe mr armstrong said
he became google xe first employee in new york working from his apartment on west th street the company was not yet two years old the internet boom had crested and ad agencies and consumer product companies were skeptical about the start up xe offering xe text ads linked to search results
mr armstrong wanted to buy fax machine to handle ad orders and billing mr page and mr brin told him they wanted to see the orders before approving the purchase
xe cthat xe how unsure people were about internet advertising xe mr armstrong recalled
but the orders gradually picked up becoming the cornerstone of the company xe booming business an expansion of google xe work force in new york followed
in craig nevill manning google computer scientist wanted to set up an engineering and research outpost in new york the company xe leaders didn xe have high hopes assuming all the best software engineers were in silicon valley but they told him he could go ahead if he could find xe cgoogle worthy xe talent in new york xe and he did hiring people in the first year
corinna cortes researcher at bell labs was one of the early recruits she joined google to begin building research arm in new york ms cortes lived in the west village had two young children and welcomed the opportunity to work on leading edge computer science at google and keep her city life she enjoys theater and opera in lincoln center restaurants in greenwich village and soho and running trails along the hudson river and in central park she has completed the new york city marathon times and bikes to work
xe cthere was no chance would go to mountain view xe said ms cortes who now leads about scientists for google research in new york xe ci wasn xe going to live in the suburbs xe
by google at that point darling of silicon valley was settling into the city in big way moving into blocklong art deco building in chelsea it needed the space as google would steadily enlarge its new york work force to today more than half of them technical staff in december the company announced it would spend billion on more office space in downtown manhattan
google xe relationship with the capital of the nation xe advertising business was cemented in when google announced it would buy doubleclick for billion
doubleclick an internet ad serving tracking and analysis company that started in new york in had good technology but also close ties to brand advertisers ad agencies and online publishers at its peak in the company reached stock market value of billion holding on after the dot com crash
in doubleclick was taken over by private equity firm for billion and two years later with its fortunes improving google paid nearly three times as much
xe cit was true diamond in the ashes of the dot com flameout xe said mr armstrong who left google as senior vice president in to become chief executive of aol
xe cwhen google bought doubleclick it really took off xe said randall rothenberg chief executive of the interactive advertising bureau trade association xe cthat was an inflection point for the digital advertising business in new york xe
in early with the city economy reeling small team in the bloomberg administration began an extensive analysis code named game changers the team interviewed hundreds of executives venture capitalists urban experts and educators it studied the technology driven economic growth in silicon valley and in israel xe start up cluster in haifa
it concluded that new york needed more computer engineering expertise the city was world leader in finance media advertising law and consulting why shouldn xe the technology for those industries be built here the bloomberg administration called its technology promotion policy xe capplied sciences xe
xe cthat was our mantra what we thought of as the yeast for changing the economy xe said robert steel the former deputy mayor for economic development xe cand applied sciences would be the key to making the new digital world here instead of someplace else xe
the city pushed applied sciences experiments including start up incubators networking events and training and internship programs nearly all private public partnerships but the biggest single step in the city xe applied sciences campaign was the creation of new graduate school focused on technology and entrepreneurial innovation
mr bloomberg and mr steel ran high profile competition that included columbia new york university and carnegie mellon university in the end though combined bid by cornell and the technion israel institute of technology won out
the cornell tech proposal fully embraced the bloomberg administration xe priority of blending science and industry graduate students xe projects at local companies are mainstay of the curriculum
xe cin new york people are driven by real world problems that can be solved with technology xe said daniel huttenlocher the dean of cornell tech who has also worked in silicon valley and is an amazon board member xe cin silicon valley the heritage is much more to build cool technology and then figure out how it can make money xe
in healthy tech hubs start ups spawn other start ups that has been the pattern in silicon valley since the early days of chip making xe young entrepreneurial refugees from shockley semiconductor laboratory would go on to found fairchild semiconductor and later intel
but in new york the virtuous cycle of start up reproduction has accelerated only in recent years it took time entrepreneurs and investors say for the tech community in new york to build the success stories human networks and self confidence that inspire serial risk taking
doubleclick once again was trailblazer as it became training ground for new york entrepreneurs the most prominent is kevin ryan former chief executive of doubleclick he became founder of six companies including two commerce companies the gilt groupe and zola an online business news site business insider and database company mongodb
mr ryan the son of manager at caterpillar was raised in the midwest and in europe when his father was posted abroad he majored in economics at yale got his at insead in france worked on wall street and helped develop the dilbert website in as manager at scripps media company
the next year mr ryan jumped into the emerging internet industry joining doubleclick as one of the company xe first dozen or so employees initially as chief financial officer and later rising to chief executive he left doubleclick in two years before google bought it
xe ci came to new york because it was an international city xe mr ryan said xe ci stayed because thought it was going to be tech city as well xe
the latter took while tech investors often suggested he would be better off starting businesses in silicon valley especially when he and two other doubleclick alumni dwight merriman and eliot horowitz founded mongodb in mongodb database maker grew slowly at first but it has proved to be commercial and financial success its stock is trading around share up from its initial price of when it went public in october it is now worth more than billion
embracing failure as learning laboratory is another feature of dynamic start up economies mr ryan saw that up close with the gilt groupe
gilt an commerce site that offered luxury goods in online flash sales raised lot of money grew quickly and then fell in gilt was sold to hudson xe bay parent company of saks fifth avenue for million less than the venture funding gilt raised
xe cwe never figured out how to make profitable business out of flash sales xe no one has xe said mr ryan founder of gilt last year gilt was sold to rue la la an commerce site for fraction of the price hudson xe bay paid
but in group of gilt alumni including mr ryan took what they had learned and started zola wedding planning site its online gift registry and other services have been used by more than half million couples and the start up raised million last may
zola xe payroll has tripled in the last two years to people and two thirds of them are women there are teams in operations finance marketing merchandising and logistics at its offices in lower manhattan yet the largest single group about quarter of the total is the engineering staff
for zola new york offers access to the talent and expertise in the city xe large fashion design and retail industries its co founder and chief executive shan lyn ma stanford and former product manager at yahoo marvels at how much the tech scene has changed since she moved to the city decade ago
xe cthe biggest thing is the sheer number of people and the amount of experience people have in tech now xe ms ma said xe cnow you just step out onto the street and you hear tech product discussions all the time xe
when maria samuel graduated from georgia institute of technology with degree in industrial and systems engineering she was recruited by apple and google she had been coding since the ninth grade and had worked in seven programming languages as an intern at nasa in houston she worked with team planning mars missions
but ms samuel accepted an offer from goldman sachs joining the investment bank in
product manager she works with team to develop software for market analysis client communication and trading she views financial markets as window into industries markets and behavior xe cevery day xe constantly learning xe she said
after the financial crisis graduates with computing skills shunned wall street for silicon valley but that is no longer the case as the finance industry is attracting young talent and seasoned technologists last year for example jpmorgan chase lured apoorv saxena senior product manager at google to lead the bank xe product development and manuela veloso from carnegie mellon university to head an research team
for ms samuel the job was appealing but so was the locale new york is where many of her friends have come to start their careers and ms samuel who sang in choir and an cappella group in college describes herself as xe cbig broadway geek xe
for most recent graduates the financial meltdown decade ago is distant memory today it is not wall street but the big tech companies like facebook and google that are under fire their business models based on gathering consumer data and targeted ads have put them at the center of global concerns about privacy and false news
that is recruiting opportunity these days for martin chavez senior partner at goldman sachs who is also computer scientist with ph from stanford at recruiting events his pitch is to say google and facebook have done xe camazing things xe and quickly add xe cif you want to work on advertising that xe where you should go if you want to use math and software to solve hard problems for governments corporations and other institutions you should come to goldman sachs xe
as the new york tech sector grows policymakers and executives hope to broaden its reach beyond manhattan and the affluent portions of brooklyn fred wilson an investor and venture capitalist in new york for more than three decades saw warning sign in the protests in long island city queens over the news that amazon had planned to move in
xe cthat xe partly from sense that it xe not going to help them and only drive up their costs xe mr wilson said of the community xe cto really be success in new york the benefits of the tech sector have to extend to every borough and every neighborhood xe
deborah estrin was the first non cornell computer scientist to join the cornell tech faculty in ms estrin was at the university of california los angeles and not looking to move but she read the cornell tech proposal and its emphasis on applied technology resonated
ms estrin says that new york xe advantage is its concentration of people in other industries working on problems that require technology to solve
xe cif you xe re doing pure tech xe superfast chip or advanced systems software xe silicon valley is still the place to be xe she said xe cbut when it comes to everything else new york really has chance to be the place to be xe

turnaround that started in is beginning to pay off for advanced micro devices xe shareholders
the chip maker xe stock hit an year high of on thursday and is up percent for the year its second quarter results for showed sales up percent compared with the same period year earlier buoyed by the success of computing graphics and enterprise hardware by contrast its longtime rival intel is up just percent this year and it reported percent increase in sales in the second quarter compared with last year
xe shares are easily the best performing among the chip makers in the standard amp poor xe stock index
that is quite reversal boom in mobile devices and video games as well as the rise of artificial intelligence and autonomous driving sent shares of chip makers soaring since the start of shares of semiconductor companies in the amp as whole have nearly doubled but shares of had lagged behind its rivals
for years produced processors whose main attraction was price when lisa su took over as chief executive of the company in she sought to change that but in the semiconductor industry new products take years to develop and so the efforts have only recently borne fruit
the company xe ryzen chips used in high performance enterprise and gaming computers outperform intel xe flagship processors many computer makers including acer asus dell hp huawei lenovo and samsung have begun using them in their devices
its graphics chips xe growth area because such processors are commonly used for artificial intelligence computation xe have sold well too and its new epyc data center chips used by companies like baidu cisco microsoft and tencent are gaining traction in market traditionally dominated by intel
it is also preparing next generation chips based on so called seven nanometer architecture ready later this year smaller nanometer manufacturing technology has traditionally provided faster chips

frisco tex xe on monday an orange and blue car with the words xe cself driving vehicle xe prominently displayed on both sides drove itself through the streets of this rapidly growing city north of dallas navigating across four lanes of traffic and around traffic circle
the car operated by the silicon valley start up drive ai will eventually become part of fleet of autonomous taxis that will ferry locals along predetermined route between the dallas cowboys facility in frisco and two other office retail and apartment complexes
while other companies have tested self driving cars for years and some are in the early stages of offering taxi service drive ai xe autonomous vehicle debut on monday was still notable it was the first new rollout of autonomous cars in the united states since pedestrian died in arizona in march after self driving car operated by uber hit her
the fatal crash renewed debate about driverless technology safety casting chill over the industry uber immediately halted its testing program which remains at standstill other big players including toyota also paused their self driving tests
but drive ai xe announcement that it will officially begin its taxi service in july showed that the industry is starting to get back on track
xe cyou don xe succeed by staring in the rearview mirror xe said andrew ng board member of drive ai who helped found the artificial intelligence labs at google and the chinese internet giant baidu
drive ai said it was moving ahead even as questions about the cause of uber xe crash remained unanswered sarah abboud an uber spokeswoman declined to comment on specifics citing an continuing investigation by the national transportation safety board but she said the company had initiated xe ctop to bottom safety review xe and had brought on christopher hart former chairman of the safety board as an adviser on its xe coverall safety culture xe
tarin ziyaee until recently the chief technology officer of the self driving start up voyage said he hoped the uber crash would push companies to openly discuss the powerful but still limited technologies inside their test cars
xe cwe need to talk about the nitty gritty xe what these systems are really doing and where their weaknesses are xe said mr ziyaee who also worked on autonomous systems at apple xe cthese companies are putting secrecy over safety that has to change the public deserves to know how things work xe
mr ng said the uber crash had not affected drive ai xe rollout plans xe cwe xe re focused on the path forward xe he said
drive ai was founded in by mr ng xe wife carol reiley roboticist and several students who worked in stanford university lab overseen by mr ng the start up specializes in rapidly progressing type of artificial intelligence called deep learning which allows systems to learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data
venture capital firms including new enterprise associates have since invested in the start up based in mountain view calif drive ai has raised million and has more than employees
waymo the autonomous vehicle company that was spun out of google is already running private taxi service outside phoenix in state that is popular destination for self driving car experiments drive ai chose to begin its trials in frisco where the streets are clean and wide pedestrian traffic is light and the sun is out for days year on average texas law passed in the fall also lets companies operate self driving services with no restrictions from municipal governments
when drive ai xe free daytime only service begins this summer it will be open to people who live or work in the area the cars will travel along few miles of road where the speed limit does not exceed miles an hour with passengers being picked up and dropped off at only few specific locations
backup drivers will be behind the wheel taking control when needed but as the program expands drive ai plans on moving drivers into the passenger seat and out of the cars entirely by the end of the year
though pedestrians are scarce in the area the cars will drive through parking lots where they are likely to encounter foot traffic so drive ai equipped its cars with digital displays designed to communicate with pedestrians and other drivers while an autonomous vehicle cannot make eye contact with pedestrian or respond to hand signals it can display simple message like xe cwaiting for you to cross xe or xe cpicking up xe
because the cars are equipped with sensors that gather information about their surroundings by sending out pulses of light xe as well as radar and an array of cameras xe the cars could potentially operate at night as well but the start up decided to keep tight rein on its service before gradually expanding the route and exposing the cars to new conditions drive ai said it would suspend operations during downpour and in the rare event of snow
there will still be situations where the cars are slow to make decisions on their own xe in the face of extremely heavy traffic for instance xe but remote technicians employed by drive ai will send help to the cars over the internet the cars will include connections to three separate cellular networks
drive ai said it was working closely with frisco officials the city of can keep the company abreast of construction zones and other road changes mr ng said and signs identifying the area where the cars will drive have been installed
thomas bamonte senior program manager for automated vehicles with the north central texas council of governments which handles planning for dallas and surrounding areas said such work would become increasingly important as the metropolitan area added roughly million new people every years
xe cwe want to invest in new technology rather than the physical expansion of roadways xe he said
asked if the uber crash gave him pause he said state law allowed companies like drive ai to operate without interference from local governments the companies he said must be cautious
noah marshall financial analyst with jamba juice which is based in frisco said the new autonomous taxi service would be xe cgreat thing xe for the town his office is along drive ai xe route and he said he hoped to try the service
other frisco residents were warier
xe cthis might be good idea but there is so much traffic here and texans aren xe very patient xe said mark mulch local real estate agent referring to one arizona city where self driving cars are being tested he added xe cscottsdale is laid back but dallas is too fast xe

companies are wrestling with how to allocate the windfall from the recent tax act it xe nice problem to have
home depot jetblue and pfizer have announced plans to pass tax savings on to shareholders through stock buybacks apple at amp comcast verizon and walt disney are distributing one time bonuses to their employees bny mellon fedex and jpmorgan chase are raising wages walmart and us bancorp are giving bonuses and raising wages boeing southwest airlines and wells fargo have increased their charitable donations and few companies perhaps fewer than the white house expected have joined with amazon to announce ambitious programs of capital investment that will create jobs and increase productivity
neglected in the public discussion is yet another strategy with large potential benefits for every company and for the nation as whole investing in human capital lost in the noise was boeing xe announcement that it will spend million on work force development training and education and disney xe investment of million to cover tuition payments for its hourly employees
until recently most corporate training programs focused on communicating company policies building the company xe xe cculture xe and complying with legal mandates to provide instruction on sexual harassment nondiscrimination and industry specific regulatory requirements company leaders and promising younger executives were often given access to high quality executive education programs
but most employees looking to upgrade their skills and qualifications had to go back to school those who remained on the job while attending classes part time could get up to annually in tax free tuition reimbursement from their employer most large companies have maintained such programs for decades but less than percent of the work force participates
today thanks to online technology there has been stunning improvement in both the quantity and quality of learning opportunities available to employees the largest platforms offer thousands of courses from more than of the world xe best universities as well as state of the art content from top technology companies many fortune companies are testing the use of such courses to develop the skills of their employees and few have begun large scale deployment offering customized courses to help employees gain competency in emerging fields such as big data machine learning deep learning and the internet of things
less esoteric subjects xe like digital marketing project management and managing people and teams xe have also proved popular among employers these courses typically cost less than percent of what it would cost to take the same courses in face to face on campus setting
the need to invest in people has never been more pressing technology is both destroying and creating jobs and with the advent of artificial intelligence and ever more powerful computational capacity to process almost unimaginably large data sets from millions of interconnected devices the pace of creative destruction is likely to accelerate mckinsey the management consulting firm estimates that roughly half of all jobs in the united states are at risk of automation in the next years if the country is to remain competitive it needs to invest in people to ensure that the high skill jobs remain here
jobs requiring computing and data science skills are likely to be the st century equivalent of mid th century factory jobs xe the backbone of prosperous middle class linkedin reports that the xe chard skills xe most in demand today are cloud computing statistical analysis and data mining and variety of software development skills involving middleware web architecture user interface control systems and mobile development there is even larger demand for more basic computing skills office software and information technology support
at amp has been prominent leader in this effort it sponsors low cost online master xe degree in computer science from georgia tech xe outstanding school of computing and offers wide variety of online courses to retrain its thousands of employees who work in jobs that will become obsolete such as landline installation and repair
the revolution in work force development is still in its infancy but already some farsighted companies are providing online training beyond their employee population microsoft is offering suite of courses on the edx platform to train users of its products from office workers who use word excel and powerpoint to software developers who want to write apps for the azure cloud and just last month google and coursera introduced program leading to certification as an support specialist this effort is aimed at high school and community college graduates and provides not only training but also direct access to participating employers with available entry level jobs
the tax cut has given companies an opportunity to invest in the future so to america xe chief executives don xe spend it all on buybacks and bonuses invest in plants equipment and research but the best investment you can make with that money is in your people

redmond wash xe microsoft said on friday that it would sell the military and intelligence agencies whatever advanced technologies they needed xe cto build strong defense xe just months after google told the pentagon it would refuse to provide artificial intelligence products that could build more accurate drones or compete with china for next generation weapons
the announcement xe made quietly in small town hall style meeting with the software giant xe leadership and employees on thursday then published on blog on friday afternoon xe starkly illustrated the radically different paths these leading american technology companies are taking as they struggle with their role in creating new generation of cyberweapons to help and perhaps someday replace american warriors
but the divergent paths also underscore concerns inside the american defense and intelligence establishments about how the united states will take on rising china
in the past two years the chinese government has set goals for dominance in the next decade in artificial intelligence quantum computing and other technologies that it believes will allow its military and intelligence agencies to surpass those of the united states pentagon officials have questioned how committed domestic technology companies are to keeping the country on the leading edge the way raytheon boeing ibm and mcdonnell douglas did during the cold war
google encountered fierce opposition from young engineers to the company xe participation in project maven program to improve how drones recognize and select their targets google declared few weeks ago that it would not bid on multibillion dollar contract to provide the pentagon with xe ccloud services xe to store and process vast amounts of data amazon for its part appears willing to supply its services to the military and intelligence agencies and it runs the information cloud services that power the central intelligence agency
even before friday xe announcement microsoft seemed like the only plausible alternative for the pentagon xe giant cloud project called jedi in which amazon is considered the front runner
but the announcement by microsoft may have greater effect on future technologies including warning systems and weapons powered by artificial intelligence and the company xe leadership after brief debates this summer concluded that by dropping out of the bidding google was also losing any real influence in how the weapons would be used
xe cthis was not hard decision xe brad smith microsoft xe president said in an interview in his office xe cmicrosoft was born in the united states is headquartered in the united states and has grown up with all the benefits that have long come from being in this country xe
but mr smith seemed to be trying to strike middle ground
he has sued the united states government repeatedly to halt washington xe efforts to gain access to customer information stored on the company xe servers and he is pressing for new international agreements to limit how the united states and its adversaries can use cyberweapons
he also argued in the blog post that xe cto withdraw from this market is to reduce our opportunity to engage in the public debate about how new technologies can best be used in responsible way xe
xe cwe are not going to withdraw from the future xe he said
mr smith xe comments stood in sharp contrast to statements by google this month when the company dropped out of the competition for the jedi cloud computing contract officials said they xe ccouldn xe be assured that it would align with our principles xe reference to set of principles issued in june in which the company vowed not to design artificial intelligence products that would be used to harm people or for surveillance or armaments the contract is believed to amount to about billion over decade but the shape of cloud computing that far into the future is hard to predict
some industry experts saw google xe statement as an effort to gain political credit for backing out of competition it was unlikely to win unlike amazon and microsoft google is missing some of the government certifications it would need to provide the software to the military
microsoft is believed to have good shot in part because president trump has made no secret of his distaste for jeff bezos amazon xe founder and the owner of the washington post but even as mr trump frequently dismisses the xe camazon washington post xe amazon is considered the front runner for the contract in large part because of the company xe experience in building the xe cloud computing ability over the last five years in an analysis published in june deutsche bank research concluded that amazon xe cis best positioned to win the lion xe share of the jedi contract xe and that microsoft was the xe cmain challenger xe
culturally google and microsoft are far different while some microsoft employees have expressed unhappiness with the company xe government contracts most recently with immigration and customs enforcement the protests among google engineers and other employees were far more intense and far more public
microsoft has been far more willing however to challenge the government it went to court to try to keep the united states from being able to subpoena microsoft for the emails or other records of customers whose data was stored abroad the suit was rendered moot by federal legislation it has been pressing for xe cdigital geneva convention xe that would like the traditional geneva convention wall off certain civilian targets the united states government has resisted the idea so far not wanting to limit president xe options to use cyberweapons against power grids or other targets on which civilians depend
xe cwe can xe control how the military uses our technology once we give it to them xe mr smith argued xe cbut the military is subject to civilian control and we believe we will have an opportunity to influence those discussions xe but it xe not up to us xe
but to large degree the import of microsoft xe announcement has more to do with the politics of confronting china and less to do with its immediate prospects
the pentagon has struggled in recent years to bring the silicon valley innovation to new weapons systems and sensors the acquisition and testing process is so long that many high tech systems are outdated by the time they begin while the obama administration succeeded in creating an outpost in silicon valley called diux or defense innovation unit experimental its budget was small and some promising off the shelf technologies xe for example small inexpensive satellites that could be fired in large numbers over north korea to detect mobile launchers xe have been delayed for years
but the next challenge facing both the government and the companies is whether american based companies will be limited in what kind of artificial intelligence technologies they can sell to china
in his interview mr smith would not indicate whether microsoft would also provide all of its products to say the people xe liberation army xe cit xe an issue we are going to have to work through xe he said but the reality he and other executives in the technology field have noted is that the chinese would not accept american made artificial intelligence code for fear that the united states would turn off chinese access to the cloud services in time of conflict

we need the next wave of innovation and we need it now
by kara swisher
ms swisher covers technology and is contributing opinion writer
if anything medmen on santa monica boulevard in west hollywood calif looks just like an apple store it xe decked out with blond wood tables on which range of products are artfully displayed xe the puffco peak portable vaporizer an electronic dosist vape pen the latest issue of ember magazine and of course so much weed delivered in an astonishing variety of ways from tinctures to gummy bears to cookies to just plain joints crowd of customers is attended to by cheerful staff members decked out in jaunty red hoodies and carrying ipads xe clet xe be buds xe urges sign on one table
it certainly looks like it xe going great at this chain of weed dispensaries but xe like lot of businesses around the newly commercialized marijuana industry in california xe medmen is struggling the latest quarter of this publicly traded company showed net loss of million on revenues of million it had lost million the previous quarter
not enough weed supply and too much expansion are among the reasons given for medmen xe problems but the disconnect between the company xe promise and reality made me think hard about some other terrible news this week apple xe announcement that it was going to miss its projected revenue by billions of dollars this quarter
kara swisher answered your questions about this column on twitter
apple has hung the moon for investors for so long now that the idea of the company struggling sent the entire global stock market into paroxysm of fear and plunging indexes it is to use an old california trope going to be real bummer for silicon valley
now stick with me here because what xe happening across what are considered fast forward industries like cannabis and tech is worrisome where is the next great boom of innovation going to come from when even the strongest brands and products might not be sure things anymore
apple is not only bellwether company in tech but also the most expertly managed one under tim cook he of course was preceded as chief executive by steve jobs who had brought the company back from the brink of bankruptcy in since then it has been all uphill to the point this summer when apple reached trillion valuation xe the first publicly traded american company to reach that high xe with price of share
today it xe trading at and analysts are predicting it will settle around yipes part of the problem is the meltdown of the economy in china where apple products are popular and the trump administration xe trade war
but as ina fried of axios noted xe cthe problems apple saw in china go far beyond just apple but apple xe iphone problems extend far beyond china too xe
indeed the last big innovation explosion xe the proliferation of the smartphone xe is clearly ending there is no question that apple was the center of that with its app centric photo forward and feature laden phone that gave everyone the first platform for what was to create so many products and so much wealth it was the debut of the iphone in that spurred what some in tech call xe ccambrian explosion xe reference to the era when the first complex animals appeared there would be no uber and lyft without the iphone and later the android version no tinder no spotify
now all of tech is seeking the next major platform and area of growth will it be virtual and augmented reality or perhaps self driving cars artificial intelligence robotics cryptocurrency or digital health we are stumbling in the dark
apple has dabbled in lot of these areas but it still makes its money by selling mobile phones and the accessories around them and while love my airpods and lose them weekly my forking over to apple for my sloppiness is not going to help compared with buying cool new phone
that business has surely leveled off as no one upgrades quite as quickly as they did before because of everything from the price tag and being worried about recession to the simple fact that the new phones don xe offer that much more than the old ones there is no question that mr cook and his team have done tremendous job taking advantage and managing this last cycle of innovation but it xe apparent that it xe now winding down
this is big issue not only for apple but also for all of tech there is not major trend that you can grab onto right now that will carry everyone forward the last cool set of companies xe uber airbnb pinterest and yes tinder xe were created many years ago and cannot think of another group that is even close to as promising
well rental scooters they xe re cool but they are derivative of the car rental business and are not going to make the big jumps in innovation that need to occur now how innovation happens is much more delicate thing than people imagine dance involving money opportunity timing execution and most important one great idea behind it all
where is that next spark that will light us all up

the advent of self driving cars the subject of so much fanfare over the last few years from automakers and technology companies may be just around the corner xe at least according to general motors
on friday said it had submitted petition to the united states department of transportation seeking permission to begin operating fully autonomous cars xe without steering wheels or pedals xe in commercial ride hailing service next year
what xe more the company said the vehicle the cruise av could be put into production on standard assembly line once approval was granted by the federal government and states where the cars would operate
self driving technology xe cis only going to have big impact if we can deploy it at large scale xe xe chief financial officer dan ammann said in an interview xe cwe intend to launch commercial ride share service at commercial scale in that will begin in one city and scale up in that city and move to other cities after that xe
the cars would most likely be used initially in ride service created by rather than in service run by an established company like uber or lyft mr ammann said
if approved the cruise avs would probably appear first in san francisco or scottsdale ariz where xe self driving subsidiary cruise automation is conducting tests in san francisco the division has set up ride hailing service using about cruise avs although the cars are available only for some of its employees not public customers
the cruise av is version of the battery powered chevrolet bolt mr ammann said it was reasonable to assume that mass production of the self driving model would take place at factory in orion township mich that already makes cruise av prototypes and the bolt though he said there were no firm plans
with its announcement appears to have jump in the race to field self driving cars ford motor is also developing car with no steering wheel or pedals but has said it won xe go into mass production until
the cruise av is four passenger vehicle with an array of radar cameras and laser sensors that are clustered on its roof and allow the car to navigate city streets and recognize vehicles pedestrians intersections and other obstacles since it does not have steering wheel it has two passenger seats in front and center console with display screen and few buttons and knobs for audio and climate control
xe petition calls for producing up to cruise avs for use in commercial ride fleets
xe cmass production and government regulation appear to be within general motors xe grasp xe said karl brauer senior analyst at kelley blue book an automotive data firm xe cif government approval is granted and begins providing autonomous taxi service to end users in multiple markets we xe ll officially be living in world of self driving cars xe
approval from the transportation department is expected to take several months and then would need local clearance before it could provide rides in cruise avs to the public mr ammann said it was not clear how the department xe main auto safety regulator the national highway traffic safety administration would evaluate xe petition and whether the agency would test the vehicles itself
the safety agency said friday that it would give xe petition xe ccareful consideration xe
local approval will depend on each state xe regulations mr ammann said michigan for example already allows cars with no steering wheels to operate on public roads other states would need to decide how to treat driverless cars
industry analysts say automakers and technology companies could generate billions of dollars in revenue and profit by selling or leasing self driving cars to ride services taxi fleets and delivery companies ford said this week that it would work with domino xe pizza and start up delivery company postmates to use its autonomous prototypes in limited commercial tests this year
waymo the autonomous vehicle company spun out of google is testing its own fully autonomous cars in arizona and california lyft and technology start up called nutonomy recently began testing self driving cars in boston uber is running pilot program in pittsburgh
tesla audi and other automakers are also developing driver assistance systems that take over for drivers in certain conditions such as cruising along divided highway those technologies however require drivers to remain alert and are considered years away from becoming fully autonomous systems
is convinced that self driving cars can play significant role in reducing deaths and injuries from auto crashes traffic accidents kill more than people year and percent result from driver errors ride services with self driving cars could also make it easier to get around without owning or renting car xe and producing those cars would help weather shift away from individual ownership
xe cultimately we see very big business opportunity around this xe mr ammann said

hong kong xe google withdrew from china eight years ago to protest the country xe censorship and online hacking now the internet giant is working on censored search engine for china that will filter websites and search terms that are blacklisted by the chinese government according to two people with knowledge of the plans
google has teams of engineers working on search app that restricts content banned by beijing said the people who asked for anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly about the project the company has demonstrated the service to chinese government officials they added
yet the existence of the project does not mean that google xe return to china is imminent the people cautioned google often builds and tests different services that never become publicly available
google xe reversal in china which was reported earlier by the intercept is the latest example of how american tech companies are trying to tailor their products to enter the huge chinese market even if it means tamping down free speech linkedin censors content in china for example and facebook developed software to suppress certain posts from appearing on the social network with the aim of potentially deploying it in china though there was no indication it was offered to chinese authorities
many of these overtures appear to fall short of winning over beijing last month facebook briefly gained approval to open subsidiary in china xe zhejiang province but that approval was abruptly withdrawn after matter of hours
google xe work on censored search engine for china has already caused an outcry among human rights activists many are concerned that the company would block long list of foreign websites including facebook twitter and the new york times as well as chinese search queries including the tiananmen massacre and information about the chinese leadership
amnesty international said it would be xe cdark day for internet freedom xe and would constitute xe ca gross attack on freedom of information and internet freedom xe if the tech giant accepted china xe censorship terms
the work is also unpopular among many of google xe own employees who have pushed back in recent months on issues such as gender in the workplace and how artificial intelligence should be applied to weaponry on wednesday several expressed their disappointment about the china project on internal messaging platforms according to four employees who saw the messages and who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly
one internal posting that was viewed by the new york times said that some employees who were asked to work on the project had declined to do so opting to transfer to different work or to quit the company some employees said the work was violation of google xe previous statements about its stance on chinese censorship as well as its recently established principles on the ethical use of artificial intelligence which state that technologies should not be used to contravene human rights
xe cwe provide number of mobile apps in china such as google translate and files go help chinese developers and have made significant investments in chinese companies like jd com xe said taj meadows google spokesman xe cbut we don xe comment on speculation about future plans xe
although google pulled its search engine out of china in the company has lately displayed more interest in regaining access to the world xe largest internet population in june google announced million investment in the chinese online retailer jd com last year google unveiled plans to open research center in china focused on artificial intelligence and the company has released translation and file management apps for the chinese market google now has more than employees in china
in the years since google xe exit local competitors have risen up including china xe dominant search engine baidu beyond search the vast majority of google xe services including its app store email service and youtube remain inaccessible behind the great firewall as the country xe system of internet controls is known
talks between google and the chinese government over the censored search engine began before the start of the recent trade war between the united states and china one of the people said the talks were not going well this person added
but the chinese government could nonetheless use google as chip in its negotiations with the american government which has been critical of the way china limits market access for united states technology companies by letting google xe search engine back into china the chinese government could give president trump political victory earning some good will
for google china is an increasingly difficult market to navigate the chinese government has tightened internet censorship significantly since president xi jinping came into power five years ago companies need great deal of resources to meet the censorship demands imposed by the government and failing to do so can be serious in the first half of china xe national internet regulator shut down or revoked the license of more than websites
google is household brand in much of the world but its name may draw blank stares from china xe younger generation who are growing up in the post google chinese internet winning these people will be an uphill battle for google especially if it cannot differentiate itself much from baidu
on chinese social media on wednesday some people cheered the news of google xe possible china re entry saying that they welcomed competition with baidu which has faced scandals over its search results related to medical treatment
others questioned whether heavily censored google might be useful
xe cwe welcome normal google but not neutered google xe said liu xingliang head of research at the beijing based analytics firm data center of the china internet xe cwe don xe need second baidu xe

the automakers need each other but they also need bold leader to secure their future
by amie tsang
renault nissan and mitsubishi on their own aren xe among the top handful of the world xe auto manufacturers together in unique alliance however they outmatch the sales of giant automakers like volkswagen
but the happy confederation has been threatened since its leader carlos ghosn was arrested on suspicion of financial wrongdoing he xe no longer in power and sits in tokyo jail cell
mr ghosn personified the alliance drawing together disparate auto cultures by the force of his personality can it survive without him
leadership vacuum has opened since mr ghosn xe arrest without their longtime leader renault and nissan have blamed each other for trying to tip the balance of power
he french government which holds percent stake in renault has weighed in with concerns that nissan is maneuvering to prevent renault from participating in the alliance xe decision making
mr ghosn and greg kelly an aide who was also arrested occupied seats on the nissan board but nissan had declined request to hold an immediate shareholder meeting meaning the french carmaker cannot replace its representatives there on thursday nissan said meeting would be held in april
the grouping gives the three companies scale allowing them to operate as one large group with sales that dwarf those of other carmakers the alliance sold million cars in compared with the million sold by volkswagen and under nine million vehicles by toyota
renault and nissan teamed up in to share purchasing and design expertise they acted as one entity with mr ghosn at the helm but did not formally merge
mitsubishi joined in and the alliance has worked with the german carmaker daimler on projects like the mercedes benz pickup truck and the production of compact cars
renault owns percent stake in nissan while nissan has percent share in renault without voting rights
enault exercised more power than the other carmakers in the alliance but nissan sold more cars the situation stirred resentment on the nissan side the japanese carmaker saw renault as unfairly piggybacking on nissan xe technology research and brand
renault for its part accused mr ghosn of favoring the japanese and nissan and blocking the french manufacturer xe expansion into china the world xe largest car market to help nissan
mr ghosn was trying to push renault and nissan to cooperate further proposing to save billion with more coordinated design and manufacturing his plan involved having all vehicles produced by the automakers be based on four combinations of chassis engines and transmissions
the nissan renault alliance was seen as innovative early on but now the auto industry is facing technological disruption companies are realizing that joining forces with rivals may be the only way to compete and cut costs in developing electric and autonomous cars
ford and volkswagen announced an alliance this month to speed the development of electric and self driving cars
until recently fiat chrysler itself the result of merger of carmakers that dates to has been upfront about its desire to merge with another big carmaker it has been working with bmw since to develop self driving cars
daimler and bmw have merged their car sharing businesses to compete with the efforts of companies like uber and alphabet google xe parent company and number of car companies have working with technology companies such as volvo which provided the chassis for driverless car tests by uber
nissan quickly dumped him as head of its board renault had been waiting for mr ghosn to be released on bail xe but court decisions have kept him jailed in japan and the french carmaker has decided to move on
jean dominique senard the chief executive of the french tire maker michelin and veteran businessman was named chairman of renault thierry bollor xc xa renault xe chief operating officer was named chief executive
renault said it planned to supervise the xe cfunctioning of the alliance xe but it is unclear whether anyone can fill mr ghosn xe role as its head
the partnership is considered essential to the success of these automakers industry experts believe the carmakers are in desperate need of strong leader the companies in the partnership are facing falling demand in the world xe biggest markets xe china the united states and europe xe and rising challenges with the emergence of electric cars and they are grappling with the effect of trade war on their supply chains
ollivier lemal the managing director in france for eim management consulting firm said the group need ed xe csomeone who is going to devote all his time and energy to restore dialogue between the manufacturers xe

the term xe cartificial intelligence xe may sound new and futuristic but it was actually coined back in for tech conference at dartmouth college since then the field has progressed in fits and starts as new hardware software and ideas slowly propelled it forward
the current boom started in when team of researchers used an artificial neural network in an image recognition competition that showed what could do with faster computer chips and bigger data sets the last six years have witnessed breakthroughs in everything from self driving cars to algorithms that can detect diseases and social networks like twitter that rely on to determine what content appears on our feeds
like most technologies the artificial intelligence world is littered with insider jargon here is non exhaustive glossary
an algorithm that attempts to mimic the human brain with layers of connected xe cneurons xe sending information to each other
when an algorithm xe decision making process or output can xe be easily explained by the computer or the researcher behind it
the field of concerned with teaching machines how to interpret the visual world xe how to see
anns that have multiple layers of connected neurons this makes the process deep compared to earlier more shallow networks
fancy way of saying xe crobots with capabilities xe
most of the time computer vision systems need to see hundreds or thousands or even millions of examples to figure out how to do something one shot and few shot learning try to create system that can be taught to do something with far less training it xe similar to how toddlers might learn new concept or task
also called gans these are two neural networks that are trained on the same data set of photos videos or sounds then one creates similar content while the other tries to determine whether the new example is part of the original data set forcing the first to improve its efforts this approach can create realistic media including artworks
systems that learn from data sets to perform and improve upon specific task it xe the current area of experiencing the biggest research boom
the discipline within that deals with written and spoken language
process where machines learn to do new task like humans do xe through system of rewards and punishments xe starting as novice and improving with practice and feedback
technique that teaches machine learning algorithm to solve specific task using data that has been carefully labeled by human everyday examples include most weather prediction and spam detection
this method tries to take training data used for one thing and reused it for new set of tasks without having to retrain the system from scratch
an approach that gives unlabeled data and has to make sense of it without any instruction in essence it is when machines xe cteach themselves xe
that can tell or show its human operators how it came to its conclusions
our current level of which can do just one thing at time like play chess or recognize breeds of cats the opposite would be strong also known as artificial general intelligence which would have the capability to do anything that most humans can do

whether it xe paving the way to self driving cars or diagnosing diseases faster than ever before digital disruption is enabling an intelligent society that integrates the physical and digital worlds it is changing our work and lives and will continue to do so in the coming years
in this rapidly evolving landscape digital transformation is no longer an option it is necessity for enterprises to survive and prosper those that embrace digital by overhauling business processes are winning while those that try to compete through traditional business methods risk being left behind and becoming irrelevant
enterprises in industries such as retail travel and media are at the forefront of digital transformation they are embracing leading new information and communications technology ict such as artificial intelligence ai big data cloud computing internet of things iot robotics and more to increase their operational agility and meet customer needs in innovative new ways leading companies in traditional industries such as manufacturing financial services energy and agriculture are also moving in this direction
however many enterprises in traditional industries are lagging these companies often have risk averse culture and do not feel the urgency to compete differently despite global consumers embracing digital technologies for more than decade they do not view digital transformation as long term strategy and many lack the technological capabilities and digital talent to transform
every industry faces disruption and for any company there is no time for hesitation enterprises must embrace the digital world to compete or risk losing out
there are three core imperatives to speeding up digital transformation for companies
tdigital transformation needs to be part of company xe central business strategy digitalization cannot simply be an add on feature it needs to underpin an organization xe entire business model to achieve new level of performance and customer engagement
tenterprises need digital transformation platform that connects intelligence data and devices enabling them to re invent major portions of their business and drive competitive advantage
tenterprises need to collaborate in digital ecosystem with industry leading partnerships and innovative initiatives that help them overcome challenges and constraints to embrace digital change
navigating the complexity of digital business and the fast changing digital landscape cannot be done alone enterprises need to partner with established technology leaders such as huawei who collaborates with its partners to deliver industry leading and new ict solutions that help enterprises on their transformation journeys

american tensions with china over international trade spring partly from concerns that china gives tax breaks to its companies to boost their exports restricts access to its markets forces foreign companies to transfer their technology to chinese companies steals intellectual property and pursues industrial espionage
expert decisive action is needed to stop these practices in defense of fair international competition and america xe strategic and commercial interests but it would be mistake to think that an aggressive defense alone will somehow prevent china xe technological success xe or ensure america xe own
china is not an innovation also ran that prospers mainly by copying other people xe ideas and producing them quickly at low cost the country is advancing aggressively to assert technological supremacy in critical fields of science and technology
in quantum computing china xe alibaba is battling google to achieve the technical milestone of xe cquantum supremacy xe in technology the three largest global players are nokia of finland ericsson of sweden xe and huawei of china which is spending more than two and half times as much on research and development as its two rivals the fuxing bullet train designed and built in china is the world xe fastest in regular operation
china is also world leader in fields like mobile payment and facial and spoken language recognition where chinese companies have made the most of their advanced algorithms and their advantages in scale and data access it is also making bold national investments in key areas of research like biotechnology and space and directly supporting start ups and recruiting talent from around the world and china has unrivaled capacity to rapidly ramp up large scale production of advanced technology products and quickly bring innovation to market
in short stopping intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices xe even if fully effective xe would not allow the united states to relax back into position of unquestioned innovation leadership unless america responds urgently and deliberately to the scale and intensity of this challenge we should expect that in fields from personal communications to business health and security china is likely to become the world xe most advanced technological nation and the source of the most cutting edge technological products in not much more than decade
but china xe technological dominance is not inevitable the united states has tremendous assets including the immense global strength of our technology sector this partly depends on unique formula no other country has been able to copy the large number of first rate american universities pursuing advanced research with long term federal support this relationship is rooted in national culture of opportunity and entrepreneurship inspired by an atmosphere of intellectual freedom supported by the rule of law and crucially pushed to new creative heights by uniting brilliant talent from every sector of our society and every corner of the world for decades these factors have helped make our nation the most powerful scientific and technological engine on earth
every american can take pride in this distinctive system but there is nothing automatic about its excellence
while china is moving forward rapidly with unified strategy called made in china to become the world leader in manufacturing and technology the united states has not made technological pre eminence matter of broad national focus if we want to remain the most or one of the most technologically advanced nations in the world we should double down on our strengths and make that vision real
for instance to capitalize on the superb american pool of artificial intelligence research talent we need the kind of long range planning that helped build united states strength in nanotechnology stable targeted multiyear funding strategy that coordinates the investments of multiple federal agencies the white house recently created select committee on artificial intelligence this good first step needs to be the start of an aggressive race to the frontier of knowledge the same is true in quantum computing modest effort being floated in congress to support advanced research should be larger faster and more ambitious
we also need to take fresh look at industry university government partnerships as mechanisms for strategic co investment in early stage research in the such efforts though far from perfect helped the american semiconductor industry survive and thrive stressing what worked and discarding what didn xe we need to collaborate actively across those three sectors in the same spirit now to make our entire innovation system faster and more effective so ideas generated in the united states get to market in the united states first
at the same time government industry schools and universities should boldly develop our homegrown talent of every age and in communities across the country an enduring benefit of the bill and america xe response to sputnik was that americans became for some decades the best educated people on earth and we can do it again
finally we should make sure we have an immigration system that welcomes the best talent from anywhere in the world so that people hungry for opportunity continue to see america as the best place for their education and the best place to spend their lives and careers enabling the united states to reap the benefit of their creativity and drive
cultivating these assets will also provide position of strength as the united states negotiates to stop unfair business and market practices
as nation the united states needs to change its focus from merely reacting to china xe actions to building farsighted national strategy for sustaining american leadership in science and innovation if all we do in response to china xe ambition is to try to double lock all our doors believe we will lock ourselves into mediocrity but if we in the united states respect china as rising competitor with many strengths we can learn from that view will inspire america to be its incomparable best

dearborn mich xe when ford motor was celebrating the th anniversary of its rouge industrial complex last week its chairman william ford jr offered an optimistic outlook for the years ahead
the company is still solidly profitable he said and while it is losing money overseas it is working on solution furthermore he praised the ability and leadership of ford xe chief executive jim hackett who he said was doing xe ca really good job xe
xe ci don xe think it xe even close to crisis xe he said
not everyone shares his confidence
the automaker xe bottom line is weakening despite record sales of its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in august its credit rating was cut to one level above junk status and ford xe stock price has fallen to its lowest point since when the united states economy was in deep recession
xe cthe foundation of ford xe the trucks xe is still healthy but there are concerns about whether ford has prepared for tomorrow and the future xe said karl brauer executive publisher of the auto information providers autotrader and kelley blue book xe cford hasn xe been effective enough in convincing investors that they are xe
in the latest move to cut costs ford is reorganizing its worldwide salaried work force of with the goal of having leaner staff by the second quarter of the move outlined to employees on thursday is likely to eliminate several thousand jobs said karen hampton company spokeswoman
xe cwe believe there will be reductions as part of it but we don xe have specific targets xe ms hampton said she said the reorganization was meant to speed decision making and cut the time it takes to develop new vehicles two points that mr hackett has emphasized
the effort was first reported by the detroit free press
part of the frustration among those sizing up the company stems from mr hackett xe slow rollout of recovery plan since taking the helm in may mr hackett has outlined broad cost reduction goals but has stopped short of explaining how they will be achieved ford once planned daylong meeting with wall street analysts on sept but canceled it in july saying it needed more time
elements of the plan are emerging bit by bit beyond the reduction in the salaried work force another initiative involves partnerships
ford is in talks with volkswagen about broad alliance that could help turn around its ailing operations in europe and south america it is also discussing ways to expand cooperation with mahindra the indian automaker india is another market where ford is struggling
mr ford great grandson of the company xe founder henry ford acknowledged the discussions at the rouge complex now the site of plant that produces the pickup
xe cwe don xe ever rely on partner to fix things for us xe he said xe cwe have to get our own house in order first partnerships can help with capital intensity and things like that xe
analysts said partnership with volkswagen could help both companies ford makes money on delivery vans and other small trucks an area where volkswagen struggles the cooperation could involve helping volkswagen produce small pickups like the ford ranger and sharing the cost of developing electric vehicles and other technologies to meet more stringent emissions regulations in europe
xe cvolkswagen is definitely intriguing xe said brian johnson of barclays capital xe cyou can definitely see the business logic behind it xe
century ago ford revolutionized auto manufacturing when it opened the rouge complex marvel in its time it produced cars and all their parts including glass tires and engines it generated its own electricity had hospital and police station and employed as many as workers this vertical integration helped ford lower costs enough to produce cars that ordinary people could afford
today ford must again find ways to cut costs in july mr hackett said his restructuring plan could involve charges of billion over the next three to five years that news arrived as ford reported net income declined by nearly half to billion in the second quarter
the urgency was highlighted last week when mr hackett said on bloomberg television that the trump administration xe tariffs on imported aluminum and steel would raise ford xe costs by billion the company said the costs would be incurred in and
the tariffs could erode the profit margins of the which has aluminum body panels but mr ford said the automaker had taken the tariffs into account and did not need to modify its turnaround plan
xe cwe just want to work with the administration on trade issues tariff issues and they xe ve been quite good about it xe he said but ford xe cruns lot better when we have certainty and we don xe have big gyrations xe he added xe cour business is at its best when we have certainty with tax regimes trade regimes xe
another trade move by the administration was welcomed by ford xe the agreement that keeps canada in three nation trade zone in north america ford makes trucks and sport utility vehicles in ontario
just two years ago ford seemed like the healthiest of the three detroit automakers but while it makes solid profit on trucks and like the explorer recent earnings reports have shown it losing money on its cars at the same time profit has plunged in europe and asia efforts to turn around its south american business have shown little progress and returns in north america by far ford xe largest region have slumped
xe cthe problem is they didn xe update and redesign their products enough xe said michelle krebs executive analyst at autotrader xe cit comes back to being slow on product decisions and product development xe
now ford xe lineup faces radical revamping in april the company said it would stop making sedans for the united states market to shore up profits within year or two familiar models like the fusion focus fiesta and taurus will disappear from showrooms in their place ford is planning new truck variants and electric vehicles
mr hackett has talked about how ford will make decisions and develop vehicles faster xe or increase the company xe xe cclock speed xe as he terms it ford announced in june that it had purchased detroit xe crumbling train station and intended to make it the base of some employees working on businesses related to self driving cars xe an effort mr hackett was running when he was called on to replace mark fields as chief executive
but his reluctance to spell out the elements of his restructuring plan has rankled analysts who follow the company and try to predict how much money it will make
mr hackett was hailed for his previous tenure as chief executive xe at the office furniture company steelcase xe but he is facing tougher challenge in running ford much larger company with employees and dozens of plants around the world
xe cwe xe like him to be crisper in going from high level statements into the actionable plans they are going to carry out xe mr johnson of barclays capital said
the tension was evident in july conference call when adam jonas of morgan stanley expressed frustration at the lack of detail on what the billion in charges will cover he asked mr hackett if he would still be around when it came time to assess the results
xe ci think there should be zero question about that xe mr hackett replied
in the meantime plenty of questions remain

xe xa the odds of athenahealth getting sold just got much higher
xe xa alexander nix the former cambridge analytica just got grilled by british lawmakers
xe xa google xe annual shareholder meeting where the company xe workplace diversity efforts will come under scrutiny
xe xa zte xe rescue may come soon but what will the get in return
xe xa the disney comcast battle comes to britain
margrethe vestager the xe antitrust chief has made it clear that europe will be one of the tech industry xe biggest regulators the ft xe reported that her commission plans to fine google over the dominance of its android mobile operating system underscoring that point yet again
more from rochelle toplensky of the ft
penalty is expected in the android case but its size is unclear the commission is empowered to impose fines of up to bn xe which is percent of the global turnover of google xe parent company alphabet xe but typically decisions are at the lower end of the range
the decision will mark an escalation of the commission xe battle with google which began eight years ago with an investigation into comparison shopping then only narrow part of online commerce though that case concluded with xe xac bn fine it has not led to significant changes to google xe business
the issue with android
as the ft notes this penalty could have big ramifications for google its android operating system dominated smartphone market worldwide because google gave it away for free but ms vestager has been looking into whether the silicon valley behemoth improperly forced phone makers to favor services like chrome and google search as well as stopping others from developing competing operating systems using the open source parts of android
the bigger picture
google has been in the sights of the for some time last year ms vestager xe commission levied record billion fine over the company xe shopping comparison service that didn xe do much to dent google xe core businesses but the android case might be different matter
but in pursuing business so core to google xe future ms vestager is again taking bold action against one of silicon valley xe most powerful titans remember that she ordered ireland to reclaim more than billion in back taxes from apple
one last question will investors care so far shares in google xe parent alphabet were down less than percent after the ft story was published its market value almost billion

the electronic medical records company just ousted its jonathan bush after series of new revelations came to light about allegations made against him over inappropriate behavior at the workplace and domestic abuse
when company undergoes changeover in its leadership that often raises the chances of it ultimately selling itself xe especially when an activist investor like elliott management is knocking on the door as it is here elliott has offered to buy the company for about billion including debt some shareholders like clearbridge investments have urged the company to start exploring xe cstrategic alternatives xe
athenahealth acknowledged that this was possible from statement by its executive chairman jeff immelt on wednesday
to ensure athenahealth maximizes shareholder value and is best positioned to realize the full potential of its premier health care technology platform the board has authorized thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives including potential sale or merger or continuing as an independent company under new leadership
the context
over the past two weeks mr bush athenahealth xe co founder and cousin of george bush had taken fire for variety of disclosures about his conduct both at the workplace and at home
xe xa the daily mail reported that the executive had been accused of punching his then wife as part of custody battle mr bush told the publication xe xe take complete responsibility for all these regrettable incidents involving my dear former wife xe
xe xa bloomberg reported on other allegations including complaint by an athenahealth employee who described xe csexually hostile environment xe at the company
in an unusual statement on wednesday mr bush said of his exit
xe ci believe that working for something larger than yourself is the greatest thing human can do family cause company country xe these things give shape and purpose to an otherwise mechanical and brief human existence athenahealth is near once in life time example of such thing with that lens on it xe easy for me to see that the very things that made me useful to the company and cause in these past twenty one years are now exactly the things that are in the way cannot imagine single organization more loaded with potential to transform health care xe
what happens now
athenahealth has the investment banks lazard and centerview partners and the law firm weil gotshal amp manges advising it on potential sale
in the meantime mr immelt xe the former chief who joined the company in february and whose entrance mr bush told me was like scoring xe ca decade xe worth of guitar lessons from elvis xe xe became executive chairman marc levine the company xe is taking more hands on role in daily operations
elliott xe response to the news
from spokesman
xe celliott welcomes the board xe decision to explore strategic alternatives and believes it is the right one for athenahealth xe shareholders employees and customers we have long believed that athenahealth is great company and we look forward to participating as bidder in the company xe strategic exploration process xe

members of the british government xe digital culture media and sports committee tried to catch him out with questions about series of media reports on cambridge analytica but they didn xe seem to unsettle the ex
things didn xe start well for mr nix he argued with damian collins the chair of the committee about whether he was allowed to give an opening statement to provide xe cfew clarifications xe about what happened when he last testified before the same panel he wasn xe
here are some choice interactions from the rest of the hearing
did mr nix take million from the consulting firm before it collapsed as the ft reported this morning
xe cthe allegation is false the facts are not correct xe
what about reports that suggested that cambridge analytica removed items from its offices before the british government xe information commissioner xe office searched the premises
xe cthose boxes were not ours as far as xe aware the were the only people to remove documents files and hardware from that office xe
did cambridge analytica techniques such as bribery honey traps and extortion to help nations win elections as mr nix claimed in secret recording made by the british broadcaster channel
xe ci didn xe represent the company properly didn xe represent what we do in our overzealousness to secure contract mark turnbull and were guilty of hyperbole of agreeing on matters that not only had we never done but we had no understanding of we were telling client what we thought he wanted to hear xe
did mr nix mean to mislead the politicians during his last hearing in february before the cambridge analytica scandal exploded then one member of the committee asked about cambridge analytica xe possession of data obtained from global science research which has been originally gathered from facebook users
xe cit was my firm impression that mr collins xe questions were about whether we were currently in possession of the data xe xa so answered no xe
xe cwhen read the transcript it became clear that mr collins was also asking whether we had ever held it clearly the answer should have been yes the fact that we received data from was already in the public domain from as early as december when the guardian published an article xe
xe ci also stand by my evidence that we do not work on facebook data and we do not have facebook data that data was given by and subsequently deleted at facebook xe request xe
how useful was the facebook data to cambridge analytica which was used to inform the company xe work in the
xe cthat data was less useful than simply using facebook xe own advertising algorithms xe

mick mulvaney the acting director of the consumer financial protection bureau announced that he was dismissing the bureau xe consumer advisory board which provides feedback on its rules and policies
by law the bureau must convene the advisory board and hold an in person meeting with its members at least twice year the bureau canceled meeting scheduled for february and last week it canceled one planned for this week
anthony welcher who as one of mr mulvaney xe deputies oversees external affairs for the bureau told those members of the board which now numbers that it would be reconstituted as smaller group
the consumer advisory board xe members are consumer activists academics entrepreneurs who run financial start ups and industry representatives from companies including citi discover and mastercard
the white house has said that it plans to help researchers develop better artificial intelligence systems by making government data available to researchers to help them but the nation remains at risk of being overtaken as global leader as other nation states appear to value the technology more highly
access to high quality data underpins most of the recent successes in artificial intelligence as the software is trained to identify patterns by studying huge quantities of historical information whether its images text or something else entirely now mit technology review reports that michael kratsios president trump xe chief technology adviser has vowed to help the research community by releasing information to it
xe canything that we can do to unlock government data we xe re committed to we xe love to hear from any academic that has any insights xe
that xe small but nevertheless welcome promise from an administration that has received criticism for placing too little importance on encouraging the development of
america xe policy while mr trump xe administration did promise earlier this year to ensure that america remains the world leader in artificial intelligence the president himself has often been quiet on the topic that xe perhaps not too surprising along with robotics is part of the automation trend that could erode many jobs in america xe so encouraging its development could be seen as running contra to mr trump xe election pledges
so far big part of the administration xe approach to giving research push has focused on removing regulatory barriers so that industry can apply the technology more quickly it also says that it xe increased investment in amp for xe ca and related technologies xe by more than percent since xe though it xe not clear what those xe crelated technologies xe are
other nations are making pushes countries such as britain and france have published ambitious policies that put in place funding education and governance initiatives large american tech firms are setting up bases there where lot of their fundamental research takes place facebook has large lab in paris for instance and google xe deepmind is based in london
china and russia have also been outspoken in their desire to be dominant powers in artificial intelligence in fact china is already giving america run for its money it published more patents and academic articles relating to the technology than the did in
big problem for america such enthusiasm about overseas is already luring academics away from the most notably geoffrey hinton an early pioneer of machine learning has relocated to toronto to run google research center other high profile academics could follow his lead and mr trump xe immigration rules might make it harder for foreign talent to replace them
maintaining an edge in artificial intelligence will be incredibly valuable for america the direct benefits to the economy are huge if difficult to accurately predict and the technology is more important than just that as it will form huge part of the nation xe military and security operations over the coming years just ask google but until the trump administration starts making more noise xe and bigger policy moves xe about being priority it runs the risk of losing first place in the race

lawmakers like senator chuck schumer were infuriated

san francisco xe facebook has been under pressure for its failure to remove violence nudity hate speech and other inflammatory content from its site government officials activists and academics have long pushed the social network to disclose more about how it deals with such posts
now facebook is pulling back the curtain on those efforts xe but only so far
on tuesday the silicon valley company published numbers for the first time detailing how much and what type of content it takes down from the social network in an page report facebook revealed that it deleted million posts in the first quarter of the vast majority of which were spam with minority of posts related to nudity graphic violence hate speech and terrorism
facebook also said it removed million fake accounts in the same period of the accounts that remained the company said percent to percent were fake
guy rosen facebook xe vice president of product management said the company had substantially increased its efforts over the past months to flag and remove inappropriate content the inaugural report was intended to xe chelp our teams understand what is happening xe on the site he said facebook hopes to continue publishing reports about its content removal every six months or so
yet the figures the company published were limited facebook declined to provide examples of graphically violent posts or hate speech that it removed for example the social network said it had taken down more posts from its site in the first three months of than it had during the last quarter of but it gave no specific figures from previous years making it hard to assess how much it had stepped up its efforts
the report also did not include all the posts that facebook had removed after publication of this article facebook spokeswoman said other types of content had been taken down from the site in the first quarter because they violated community standards but those were not detailed in the report because the company was still developing metrics to study them
congress last week released more than facebook ads linked to russia around the presidential election the most comprehensive look at the misinformation campaign mounted on the social network
facebook also used the new report to advance push around artificial intelligence to root out inappropriate posts facebook xe chief executive mark zuckerberg has long highlighted as the main solution to helping the company sift through the billions of pieces of content that users put on its site every day even though critics have asked why the social network cannot hire more people to do the job
xe cif we do our job really well we can be in place where every piece of content is flagged by artificial intelligence before our users see it xe said alex schultz facebook xe vice president of data analytics xe cour goal is to drive this to percent xe
facebook is aiming for more transparency after turbulent period the company has been under fire for proliferation of false news divisive messages and other inflammatory content on its site which in some cases have led to real life incidents graphic violence continues to be widely shared on facebook especially in countries like myanmar and sri lanka stoking tensions and helping to fuel attacks and violence
facebook has separately been grappling with data privacy scandal over the improper harvesting of millions of its users xe information by political consulting firm cambridge analytica mr zuckerberg has said that the company needs to do better and has pledged to curb the abuse of its platform by bad actors
on monday as part of an attempt to improve protection of its users xe information facebook said it had suspended roughly third party apps that collected data from its members while it undertook thorough investigation
the new report about content removal was another step by facebook to clean up its site jillian york the director for international freedom of expression at the electronic frontier foundation said she welcomed facebook xe numbers
xe cit xe good move and it xe long time coming xe she said xe cbut it xe also frustrating because we xe ve known that this has needed to happen for long time we need more transparency about how facebook identifies content and what it removes going forward xe
samuel woolley research director of the institute for the future think tank in palo alto calif said facebook needed to bring in more independent voices to corroborate their numbers
xe cwhy should anyone believe what facebook says about this when they have such bad track record about letting the public know about misuse of their platform as it is happening xe he said xe cwe are relying on facebook to self report on itself without any independent vetting that is concerning to me xe
facebook previously declined to reveal its content removal efforts citing lack of internal metrics instead it published country by country breakdown of how many requests it received from governments to obtain facebook data or restrict content from facebook users in that country those figures did not specify what type of data the governments asked for or what posts were restricted facebook also published country by country report on tuesday
according to the new content removal report about percent of the million pieces of content that facebook took down from its site in the first quarter was spam about percent of that deleted content had nudity facebook said with even smaller percentages of posts removed for graphic violence hate speech and terrorism
in the report facebook said its found percent of terrorist content on the site leading to the removal of roughly million pieces of content in the first quarter the also detected percent of posts that were problematic because of nudity with million such posts taken down
but facebook still relied on human moderators to identify hate speech because automated programs have hard time understanding context and culture of the million pieces of hate speech facebook removed in the first quarter percent was detected by according to the new report
facebook said it also removed million posts that had graphic violence percent of which were detected by
the company did not break down the numbers of graphically violent posts by geography even though mr schultz said that at times of war people in certain countries would be more likely to see graphic violence than others he said that in the future facebook hoped to publish country specific numbers
the report also did not include any figures on the amount of false news on facebook as the company did not have an explicit policy on removing misleading news stories mr schultz said instead facebook has tried to deter the spread of misinformation by removing spam sites that profit from advertisements that run alongside false news and by removing fake accounts that spread them
an earlier version of this article using information provided by facebook referred incorrectly to the to percent of accounts on the social network that were fake it is the percentage of facebook accounts that were fake even after purge of such accounts it is not the percentage of facebook accounts that were purged as being fake the article also misstated how often facebook hopes to publish reports about the content it removes it is roughly every six months not every quarter

for the past five years the hottest thing in artificial intelligence has been branch known as deep learning the grandly named statistical technique put simply gives computers way to learn by processing vast amounts of data thanks to deep learning computers can easily identify faces and recognize spoken words making other forms of humanlike intelligence suddenly seem within reach
companies like google facebook and microsoft have poured money into deep learning start ups pursuing everything from cancer cures to back office automation trumpet their deep learning expertise and the technology xe perception and pattern matching abilities are being applied to improve progress in fields such as drug discovery and self driving cars
but now some scientists are asking whether deep learning is really so deep after all
in recent conversations online comments and few lengthy essays growing number of experts are warning that the infatuation with deep learning may well breed myopia and overinvestment now xe and disillusionment later
xe cthere is no real intelligence there xe said michael jordan professor at the university of california berkeley and the author of an essay published in april intended to temper the lofty expectations surrounding xe cand think that trusting these brute force algorithms too much is faith misplaced xe
the danger some experts warn is that will run into technical wall and eventually face popular backlash xe familiar pattern in artificial intelligence since that term was coined in the with deep learning in particular researchers said the concerns are being fueled by the technology xe limits
deep learning algorithms train on batch of related data xe like pictures of human faces xe and are then fed more and more data which steadily improve the software xe pattern matching accuracy although the technique has spawned successes the results are largely confined to fields where those huge data sets are available and the tasks are well defined like labeling images or translating speech to text
the technology struggles in the more open terrains of intelligence xe that is meaning reasoning and common sense knowledge while deep learning software can instantly identify millions of words it has no understanding of concept like xe cjustice xe xe cdemocracy xe or xe cmeddling xe
researchers have shown that deep learning can be easily fooled scramble relative handful of pixels and the technology can mistake turtle for rifle or parking sign for refrigerator
in widely read article published early this year on arxiv org site for scientific papers gary marcus professor at new york university posed the question xe cis deep learning approaching wall xe he wrote xe cas is so often the case the patterns extracted by deep learning are more superficial than they initially appear xe
if the reach of deep learning is limited too much money and too many fine minds may now be devoted to it said oren etzioni chief executive of the allen institute for artificial intelligence xe cwe run the risk of missing other important concepts and paths to advancing xe he said
amid the debate some research groups start ups and computer scientists are showing more interest in approaches to artificial intelligence that address some of deep learning xe weaknesses for one the allen institute nonprofit lab in seattle announced in february that it would invest million over the next three years largely in research to teach machines to generate common sense knowledge xe an initiative called project alexandria
while that program and other efforts vary their common goal is broader and more flexible intelligence than deep learning and they are typically far less data hungry they often use deep learning as one ingredient among others in their recipe
xe cwe xe re not anti deep learning xe said yejin choi researcher at the allen institute and computer scientist at the university of washington xe cwe xe re trying to raise the sights of not criticize tools xe
those other non deep learning tools are often old techniques employed in new ways at kyndi silicon valley start up computer scientists are writing code in prolog programming language that dates to the it was designed for the reasoning and knowledge representation side of which processes facts and concepts and tries to complete tasks that are not always well defined deep learning comes from the statistical side of known as machine learning
benjamin grosof an researcher for three decades joined kyndi in may as its chief scientist mr grosof said he was impressed by kyndi xe work on xe cnew ways of bringing together the two branches of xe
kyndi has been able to use very little training data to automate the generation of facts concepts and inferences said ryan welsh the start up xe chief executive
the kyndi system he said can train on to scientific documents of to pages each once trained kyndi xe software can identify concepts and not just words
in work for three large government agencies that it declined to disclose kyndi has been asking its system to answer this typical question has technology been xe cdemonstrated in laboratory setting xe the kyndi program mr welsh said can accurately infer the answer even when that phrase does not appear in document
and kyndi xe reading and scoring software is fast human analyst mr welsh said might take two hours on average to read lengthy scientific document and perhaps read in year kyndi xe technology can read those documents in seven hours he said
kyndi serves as tireless digital assistant identifying the documents and passages that require human judgment xe cthe goal is increasing the productivity of the human analysts xe mr welsh said
kyndi and others are betting that the time is finally right to take on some of the more daunting challenges in that echoes the trajectory of deep learning which made little progress for decades before the recent explosion of digital data and ever faster computers fueled leaps in performance of its so called neural networks those networks are digital layers loosely analogous to biological neurons the xe cdeep xe refers to many layers
there are other hopeful signs in the beyond deep learning camp vicarious start up developing robots that can quickly switch from task to task like humans published promising research in the journal science last fall its technology learned from relatively few examples to mimic human visual intelligence using data times more efficiently than deep learning models the system also broke through the defenses of captchas the squiggly letter identification tests on websites meant to foil software intruders
vicarious whose investors include elon musk jeff bezos and mark zuckerberg is prominent example of the entrepreneurial pursuit of new paths in
xe cdeep learning has given us glimpse of the promised land but we need to invest in other approaches xe said dileep george an expert and co founder of vicarious which is based in union city calif
the pentagon xe research arm the defense advanced research projects agency has proposed program to seed university research and provide noncommercial network for sharing ideas on technology to emulate human common sense reasoning where deep learning falls short if approved the program machine common sense would start this fall and most likely run for five years with total funding of about million
xe cthis is high risk project and the problem is bigger than any one company or research group xe said david gunning who managed darpa xe personal assistant program which ended decade ago and produced the technology that became apple xe siri

moscow xe for the teams hoping to prevent germany from becoming the first team to repeat as world cup champion since here is bit of less than encouraging news
after winning the tournament in oliver bierhoff the executive who oversees the operations of the team decided the squad xe technical and analytics capabilities needed serious upgrade nothing says xe cunderperformance xe apparently like outscoring opponents by and winning the world championship for fourth time
so when the celebrations were over and bierhoff sat down with the quants at the german software maker sap which designs and manages the analytics operations for the national team he gave them mission figure out how to come up with an innovative way to make the most essential information and video available to players at any time and wherever they might be
xe cit xe feedback culture under bierhoff xe said sven schwerin wenzel senior manager of the soccer team project for sap xe che said the players were really interested in getting video based feedback they are asking for more xe
with an average age of germany has the second youngest team at the world cup only nigeria xe team is younger that translates into two important qualities young legs that can recover quickly in monthlong tournament and brains programmed to learn using video because of the era during which many of them came of age
bierhoff who played for germany from to has been at the forefront of incorporating technology into the international game even during matches speaking with reporters at germany xe training camp in italy recently bierhoff said he welcomed the use of tablets for coaches at the world cup xe cthere are many more options available such as artificial intelligence and machine learning xe things that are not necessarily well heard within football but will be part of the future xe he said
germany begins group play sunday against mexico in moscow its group also includes sweden and south korea and it feels so good about its chances and its souped up analytics hardware that it scheduled news conference for friday in moscow to show it off
to be sure all the top national teams have embraced statistical analysis to some extent they all study the basic quantitative information such as heat maps possession statistics pass counts and player tendencies also there are plenty of team video sessions where players gather to watch what they did right and wrong and the tactics their opponents have employed during previous matches
for germany though the team sessions that in took place only in hotel conference rooms have been liberated into the devices that the players carry in their equipment bags and keep on their night tables that means germany xe players xe an information obsessed group to begin with xe most likely will come onto the field for each match armed with more knowledge about themselves and their opponents than any other team
germany xe small analytics department led by the head scout christopher clemens and few assistants is in constant contact with the sap team while germany prepares for each tournament during matches the analysts divide responsibility for watching few different players each on the field using tagging technology each player then can receive xe shortly after the conclusion of any match xe series of video clips of him playing in any number of different situations that emphasize the areas that the coaches need him to focus on such as when they press opponents or counterattack or tackle or play the ball behind an opponent
each play comes with qualitative evaluation from one of the scouts suggestion of how this could be done better or why it proved successful and should be done more often
tap or two on other parts of the screen can deliver similar footage about upcoming opponents or the latest fitness readings downloaded from the monitors the players wear during training xe information that can give the players clues about whether to go all out in the next practice or to dial back effort and maintain energy for the next match
schwerin wenzel said this was all part of the process to switch from manually uploading data to focus on real time information that the coaches need to deliver quickly if germany wants to do what no team since brazil has managed since repeat as world cup champion
xe call of this is invented by them on the pitch xe he said of germany xe coaching staff and players xe cthat xe where the needs are defined xe

state of the art
in his final state of the art column farhad manjoo reflects on the industry xe changes and presents new guide for navigating the future of technology
by farhad manjoo
nearly five years ago in my very first state of the art column offered straightforward plan for how to survive what was shaping up to be turbulent time in the tech world
at the time technology felt thrilling and world changing you could use smartphone to call up car as if you were some kind of baller you could video chat with people anywhere in the world like xe cthe jetsons xe xe and maybe some of those people would use the new tech to throw off the yoke of repression somehow they were the days of miracle and wonder
but tech also felt confusing there were so many new things xe every year new phones with so much more power made by so many new companies all running so many new and purportedly revolutionary apps xe that it was easy to get lost in the hype it was also easy to pick the wrong horse there was no guarantee that this or that novelty would last until next year
so to get the most out of innovations and avoid betting on the also rans my inaugural advice to readers was to follow these steps buy hardware from apple use online services made by google and get digital media from amazon
now the time has come to amend and update that advice xe which is fitting because this will be my final column in these pages xe not going far xe ll be writing for the new york times xe opinion section starting next year
the tech industry in is far more consequential than it was in when started this job it xe bigger more pervasive and in every way more dangerous it is also less amenable to outside pressure the companies that run the show are more powerful than ever and in many cases governments xe especially in the united states xe have proved ineffective at curbing their excesses
how should you as an ethical and upstanding user of tech navigate this misbegotten industry offer three new maxims for surviving the next era of tech hope you heed them the world rides on your choices
not long ago xe in the nascent days of smartphones mobile apps and the mysterious xe ccloud xe xe wading into the market for new tech was often risky you might buy phone or tablet whose maker would quickly go belly up lot of stuff didn xe work well backing up your data was headache keeping your photos organized across different devices was nightmare and even technologies that did work left you plagued with guilt and worry remember the curse of email spam or how you had to pay through the nose for texting
something strange and unexpected has happened in the last five years lot of tech got pretty good slowly but surely many of our basic struggles were fixed nothing is perfect but for most people the mobile era has brought simplicity to tech for the first time
but ubiquitous quality has given rise to new problem if everything just works how are you supposed to choose what to buy
my advice don xe just consider how well product works but look at who xe making it and how it is sold before you dive into any new doodad consider company xe ethics morals branding and messaging if you aren xe comfortable look to alternatives last year for instance switched to lyft from uber and xe ve never looked back most important when you xe re choosing tech it xe wise to consider the business model xe because it xe in the buying and the selling of product rather than in the using that you can best figure out its dangers
for instance even though google xe pixel line of phones is very good xe far more affordable option with some features that iphone users might kill for xe stick with apple xe phones because appreciate the simplicity of the trade pay apple huge sum of money for the device and it takes extraordinary care in protecting me from some of the worst digital scourges
don xe doubt google xe capacity to make great devices but because google makes most of its money from ads and because the internet ad business lies at the heart of just about every terrible thing online xe rather not fall deeper into that swamp
similarly found facebook xe new video chatting machine portal to be very good but xe ll never buy it besides facebook xe dependence on targeted ads the company has repeatedly breached its users xe trust not to mention the casual disregard it has shown for larger ideas like democracy portal is nice but it xe not that nice
one thing that hasn xe changed in the last five years is who xe running the show when started writing this column apple google facebook amazon and microsoft were tech xe biggest and most influential companies today even with recent stock market troubles the same five giants sit at the top of the world
xe ve railed against this sort of concentration again and again xe the tech giants xe increasing domination ruins innovation undermines consumer choice and generally makes lot of the industry ungovernable lawmakers around the world are now taking notice and it xe possible that in the next five years we xe ll see greater regulatory curbs to the behemoths xe size and scope
but you don xe have to wait for politicians to weigh in your choices as consumer matter too xe and for better healthier tech industry it xe best to avoid mindlessly feeding the giants whenever you can if you have choice between something made by one of the big five and some indie brand choose the indie
here xe one example even though like apple xe hardware and appreciate its business model xe ve stayed away from apple music its subscription streaming service for me spotify is superior in just about every way its app works better its music recommendation algorithm is eerily good it releases innovative features at faster clip and its songs play on more types of devices
best of all spotify is an independent company so when pay for it am in small way spreading the wealth in the industry
there are some downsides to this apple has shamelessly given its own service priority on its devices xe so siri for example will play music from apple xe service but not from spotify but it xe precisely this sort of mischief that xe hoping to dissuade by putting my money elsewhere
there are lots of other examples for looking beyond the big guys you can use dropbox instead of storing all your stuff with apple and google rather than microsoft word or google docs write in ulysses lightweight composing app that is faster and more elegant than any big tech competitor whatever tech you xe re in the market for there xe most likely some innovative thing made by non giant that deserves consideration if not your money
one reason the tech industry feels as terrible as it now does is that many of us failed to appreciate the collective power of our choices ten years ago smartphones looked like fun gadgets and social media seemed like harmless pastime xe and few saw the implications for society in their ubiquity not least the people running the companies and making this stuff
the lesson of the last decade is that our private tech choices can alter economies and societies they matter and they matter most in the mindless rush when everyone seems to be jumping on board the latest new thing because it xe in these heady moments that we lose sight of the precise risks of turning ourselves over to tech
that xe why the most important lesson xe ve gleaned in writing this column is this just slow down don xe jump on the newest thing if it isn xe plagued with bugs or security nightmares some other unexpected emergent risk probably lies within it xe and whatever its short term benefits you may live to regret it
yes tech could make everything better but we should be on guard for the ways it could make things worse xe how self driving cars could induce sprawl how the xe cinternet of things xe could provoke apocalypse how social media could ruin democracy
are these unlikely dangers maybe but we live in unpredictable times the unlikely happens be careful go slow

tech fix
when it comes to online comments and discourse and what you can do to limit their toxicity you only have certain amount of power the real leverage lies with the tech companies
by brian chen
this column is going to be bit unusual typically write about broad tech problem and offer some solutions but this week xe ve stumbled into topic that many agree has no easy fix online comments
over the last decade commenting has expanded beyond box under web articles and videos and into social networking sites like facebook and twitter that has opened the door to more aggressive bullying harassment and the ability to spread misinformation xe often with difficult real life consequences
case in point the right wing conspiracy site infowars for years the site distributed false information that inspired internet trolls to harass people who were close to victims of the sandy hook school shooting this week after much hemming and hawing about whether to get involved some giant tech firms banned content from infowars twitter did not after determining infowars had not violated its policies
what does that show us that you as an internet user have little power over content you find offensive or harmful online it xe the tech companies that hold the cards
given the way things are going our faith in the internet may erode until we distrust it as much as we do tv news said zizi papacharissi professor of communication at the university of illinois chicago who teaches social media courses
xe ci think we are the ones who are breaking it because we never completely learned how to use it xe she said of the internet xe cwe break it and we fix it again every day at some point it will crack xe added ms papacharissi who also edited networked self series of books studying people xe behaviors and relationships on social networks
why are internet comments so hopelessly bad and how do we protect ourselves even though there is no simple fix there are some measures we can aim to take here xe what you need to know about how we got here and what you can try
there are many theories about why the internet seems to bring out the worst in people gathered sampling of some noteworthy findings
ms papacharissi said that in her years of researching and interviewing people about online behavior one conclusion has remained consistent people use the internet to get more of what they do not get enough of in everyday life so while people have been socialized to resist being impulsive in the real world on the internet they cave to their temptations to lash out
xe cthe internet becomes an easy outlet for us to shout something and feel for moment fulfilled even though we xe re really just shouting out into the air xe she said
this is nothing new of course before the internet people took their frustrations to tv and radio talk shows the internet was simply more accessible less moderated space
daniel ha founder of disqus popular internet comment tool used by many websites said the quality of comments vary widely depending on the pieces of content being discussed and the audiences they attract for example there are videos about niche topics like home improvement that invite constructive commentary from enthusiasts but there are others such as music video from popular artist or general news article which ask people from all around the world to comment that xe when things can get especially unruly
xe cyou have an airport of people from all walks of life coming together and they xe re speaking different languages with different attitudes and they xe re just saying stuff xe mr ha said
comments can be terrible simply because many people are flawed it xe up to the content providers and tech platforms to vet their communities and set rules and standards for civilized discussion
that is an area where many resource strained news publications fall short they often leave their comments sections unmoderated so they become cesspools of toxic behavior it is also an area where tech companies like facebook and twitter struggle because they have long portrayed themselves as neutral platforms that do not that do not wish to take on the editorial roles of traditional publishers
tech companies have long employed various methods to detect fake comments from bots and spammers so called captcha tests for completely automated procedures for telling computers and humans apart ask you to type word or select photos of specific item to verify you are human and not bot other methods like detecting device type or location of commenter can be used to pin down bots
yet security researchers have shown there are workarounds to all these methods
some hackers are now getting extremely clever about their methodologies when the federal communications commission was preparing to repeal net neutrality last year there were million comments posted on its site between april and october many of which expressed support for the move
jeff kao data scientist used machine learning algorithm to discover that million comments were likely fakes posted by bots many comments appeared to be very convincing with coherent and natural sounding sentences but it turned out that there were many duplicates of the same comments subbing out few words for synonyms
xe cit was like mad libs xe he said xe cif you read through different comments one by one it xe hard to tell that some are from the same template but if you use these machine learning algorithms you can pick out some of these clusters xe
the said in letter that it planned to re engineer its comment system in light of the fakes
for the issue of spoofed comments there is fairly simple solution you can report them to the site xe owner which will likely analyze and remove the fakes
other than that don xe take web comments at face value mr kao said the lesson he learned was to always try to view comments in wider context look at commenter xe history of past posts or fact check any dubious claims or endorsements elsewhere on the web he said
but for truly offensive comments the reality is that consumers have very little power to fight them tech companies like youtube facebook and twitter have published guidelines for what types of comments and material are allowed on their sites and they provide tools for people to flag and report inappropriate content
yet once you report an offensive comment it is typically up to tech companies to decide whether it threatens your safety or violates law xe and often harassers know exactly how offensive they can be without clearly breaking rules historically tech companies have been conservative and fickle about removing inappropriate comments largely to maintain their positions as neutral platforms where people can freely express themselves
in the case of infowars apple google and facebook were the ones that banned some content from the conspiracy site after determining it violated their policies twitter xe chief executive jack dorsey said on tuesday that the company did not suspend the accounts belonging to infowars because its owner alex jones did not violate any rules
xe cif we succumb and simply react to outside pressure rather than straightforward principles we enforce and evolve impartially regardless of political viewpoints we become service that xe constructed by our personal views that can swing in any direction xe he said in tweet
twitter did not immediately respond to request for comment elaborating on the decision
beyond reporting comments individually you could also use an online petition tool like change org to demand that tech companies remove offensive content but note that supporters of infowars are already on that site petitioning for the site content to be restored on youtube
when publishers and tech companies fail to address inappropriate comments ms papacharissi recommended an exercise in self discipline
xe cthink before you read xe she said xe cthink before you speak and you don xe always have to respond lot of things do not deserve response sometimes not responding is more effective than lashing out xe
brian chen is the lead consumer technology writer he reviews products and writes tech fix column about solving tech related problems before joining the times in he reported on apple and the wireless industry for wired bxchen

daily crossword column
david liben nowell is back with forward looking puzzle
by caitlin lovinger
saturday puzzle xe one of the things that struck me about today xe excellent puzzle was the freshness of its two spanning across entries which always assume are the xe cseeds xe or inspirations of particular grid which is not always true in fact but the norm they seem to play off each other as hopeful signs of human evolution one societal one technological
then david mr liben nowell xe notes came in and he actually came up with this whole shebang back in guess that xe recent enough besides the path forward is always series of ups and downs that evens out when viewed through the lens of time
there xe something in the air right now that makes my mind tend toward interrogative possibilities so assumed xe cadmissions xe would be of incriminating information instead the academic meaning is meant here xe when you visit college as hopeful future student you go to the admissions office for your campus map unless you xe ve already downloaded your interactive app with pop up history lessons this entry is debut
clued as such drew total blank although xe seen xe cthe last emperor xe in the theater as well as its oscar successor rain man would have thought the entry as coming out later in my life but time is funny that way if you xe ve never seen it it absolutely stands the test of time and for me at least has gotten even more poignant as don xe think knew anyone with autism in when xe crain man xe came out dustin hoffman got the oscar for best actor too
they xe re all over the news and if you xe re in the market for new ride or just incapable of tuning out tv commercials then you xe re aware of all the technology that xe developing toward self driving cars
in the united states where car culture is so prevalent world dominated by robotic private transportation is little dystopian xe we need to bike and walk more in the and our public transportation is often substandard but this technology is going to be lot safer and there are already roads in sweden that charge electric vehicles when they travel on them xe the possibilities are there
went hunting for something like xe coriginal xe or xe cpainting xe for this entry xe cprint source xe finally arriving on xe cprototype xe as the only possibility that fit that or the nonexistent xe clithogram xe wrong print we xe re talking forensic evidence here in the shape of fingerprints left by one xe fingertip as dna collection advances it xe unclear how the role of fingerprints will play in the future xe although it seems that there xe technology developing to harvest your dna from your prints
this wasn xe really blocker xe given the limited materials one uses to build big ol xe tower xe but it xe an interesting tidbit that the us steel building in pittsburgh was designed to be showcase for steel xe capabilities this entry has had some other interesting clues did anyone remember that steel was the first publicly traded billion dollar company about century ago
this clue is timely rosh hashana the jewish new year was earlier this week assumed xe cfresh start xe here rather than clean slate but xe ll take either the entry that straightened me out of course was jerusalem
the ubiquity of these square mazes qr codes helps make them blend in they xe re on print advertising and actual products and my neighborhood just planted some trees with qr code id tags hanging from their branches the xe cqr xe stands for quick response because they xe re far more informative than bar codes an additional lure is that you can set up your own in order to add extra information it xe like putting weblink on an actual physical object or street sign or print advertisement
this puzzle is one of the success stories of the editing process so owe extra thanks to will for this one for having both high standards and patience with constructors
back in xe built puzzle around the same pair of letter seeds which may speak little to their pairing was starting to write this puzzle just as obergefell hodges was being decided xe plus xe computer science faculty member so was particularly drawn to the second of the two long entries had managed to include bunch of other longer entries that liked lot sparkplug harper lee its so easy but as the rejection note from will and joel said there were too many ugly short entries that xe cstart to add up after while to make for unpleasant solving xe that xe always tendency that have to fight when xe filling puzzles tend to overvalue what consider to be awesome long entries and fail to pay enough attention to the costly short junk that they induce
put the puzzle away in my overstuffed filing drawer of rejections but kept finding myself compelled by this pair of and so pulled it back out couple of years later in short moved couple of black squares around refilled again from scratch and submitted it again earlier this year good portion of the nw corner my favorite portion of the version stayed intact from attempt to attempt and ovines survived but migrated in the grid save those pieces and the everything else was brand new
and here xe the result hope you enjoy it xe and even if you don xe hope you appreciate that the version you didn xe see was lot worse

xe cstewart certainly is the grandfather of what xe going on xe in silicon valley said louis rossetto wired xe co founder and first editor xe cthey don xe even know who she is xe he added half jokingly about ms williams
turns out he wasn xe wrong xe cwho is serena williams xe mr brand later said when asked xe cyes yes the williams sisters xe he said when reminded the one married to alexis ohanian the co founder of reddit
while partygoers in new york and los angeles are used to socializing with celebrities the wired dinner at the tartine manufactory in the city xe mission district was quintessential silicon valley about computer scientists tech entrepreneurs biologists astronomers writers and thinkers
xe cstatus depends lot on in silicon valley xe said nicholas thompson the lanky editor in chief of wired and the party xe co host

wattpad the storytelling application with which millions of users upload original stories and fan fiction is creating publishing division wattpad books the company has worked with other publishing or media companies in the past to adapt stories from the platform into books and movies xe cafter xe by anna todd is standout and the popular netflix film xe cthe kissing booth xe is based on story written by beth reekles who uploaded the story to wattpad in when she was now wattpad will cull the platform for stories to publish as books under the new imprint starting with six young adult titles this fall
the company will use what it calls story dna machine learning technology to take xe cthe guesswork xe out of the publishing equation said allen lau the company xe chief executive and co founder whereas traditional publishing is based on individual editors xe tastes wattpad xe technology will scan and analyze the hundreds of millions of stories on the app to find themes or elements that might determine story xe commercial success lau said wattpad will combine this xe cdata driven xe approach with human editors xe critical eye
xe cwe xe re able to take the opinions of million users and what are they reading and what xe resonating with them as starting point xe said ashleigh gardner who will head the publishing division
the initial list of books were written by users whose ages range from late teens to mid xe cwhat happened that night xe by deanna cameron is teen psychological thriller about girl who kills the boy next door without clear motive which gardner compared to xe cgone girl xe another book xe ctrapeze xe by leigh ansell is about girl who grew up in the circus and suffers life changing injury all the books have already been successful on wattpad where they will remain after they are published the writers will be paid advances and royalties that gardner said are competitive with industry standards

xe chover xe won xe be remembered as milestone of paranoid science fiction but it may be the first example of its genre in which the heroine wise to conspiracy gets to yell xe cwhy are you following me xe at self driving car on the evidence it xe difficult to stage such scene without getting bad laugh just as it xe tough to film car chase in which the good guys dodge sentient drones without having it look silly
matt osterman xe allegorical thriller written by its star cleopatra coleman flirts with topicality on several fronts commenting not only on drone strikes but also on agribusiness in the world of the future mass food shortage has led farmers to use drones that maximize their output and protect their property the company that makes these bots which are highly intelligent except when not has the slogan xe cbe good guy with drone xe

the rerelease of stanley kubrick xe masterpiece encourages us to reflect again on where we xe re coming from and where we xe re going

in the spring of the filmmaker stanley kubrick was very worried nasa was about to fly the mariner space probe past mars
at the time he was deep in development of blockbuster film about the discovery of alien intelligence word was that mgm had bet their studio on the film what if mariner discovered life on mars and scooped them
kubrick looked into whether he could buy insurance against that event he could but the price was astronomical kubrick decided to take his chances according to new book about the making of the movie xe cspace odyssey stanley kubrick arthur clarke and the making of masterpiece xe by michael benson simon amp schuster
that was years ago we still haven xe discovered intelligence or even believable evidence of pond scum anywhere else in the universe xe not for lack of effort new spacecraft tess designed to look for habitable nearby planets just vaulted into space and an interstellar asteroid recently spotted streaking through the solar system was inspected for radio signals another robot is on its way to listen in on the heart of mars we still don xe know if we are alone
mr kubrick xe movie xe space odyssey xe finally debuted late and over budget in april to baffled film critics and long lines of young people john lennon said he went to see it every week it was the top grossing movie of the year and is now perennial on critics xe lists of the most important movies of all time often the first movie scientists mention if you ask them about sci fi they have enjoyed
in honor of its th anniversary it is being rereleased at the cannes film festival on saturday and then in various cities around the world in shiny new version overseen by christopher nolan the director of xe cdunkirk xe and xe cinception xe among other films he told the los angeles times the original film had been xe ctouchstone xe from his childhood
the movie written by kubrick and arthur clarke whose books and stories the movie was based on and directed by kubrick is multisensory ode to cosmic mystery fate and the future long stretches happen with no explication or action except the zero gravity ballets of spaceships immaculately imagined
the movie broke with many of the conventions of the time like mood music to tell you what to feel and think xe xe left you alone in space with your thoughts
the story begins four million years ago in africa where bunch of bedraggled primates are losing the battle of the survival of the fittest until strange black monolith appears to the thunder of xe calso sprach zarathustra xe one of those apemen is inspired to pick up bone and use it as club to kill the animals that have been pushing him around
suddenly the apemen are eating meat and chasing their rivals away from the water hole in moment of exultation the ape throws the bone into the sky where in what has been called the longest fast forward in film history it turns into spaceship
around that toss kubrick pivots his movie and all of human evolution another monolith appears on the moon and yet another in orbit around jupiter where an astronaut named dave bowman connects with it after subduing neurotic computer the hal which has murdered his shipmates in the finale bowman is sent through xe cstar gate xe on trip through space and time death and rebirth returning as glowing star child to float like fetus over the earth
first saw xe xe in the spring of in the same pharmaceutically compromised condition that all my friends did didn xe need that kind of help anyway having grown up reading clarke xe stories in particular the novel xe cchildhood xe end xe and the short story xe cthe sentinel xe
the last time watched the movie on vhs of all things on my tiny home television was in on the eve of its eponymous year
never realized how much had missed until read mr benson xe book deep informative and entertaining dive into the making of the movie
one revelation is how haphazardly the movie was made nevermind the special effects and the model spaceships kubrick and clarke were making up much of the story as they went along up until the very end mr benson tells us they were struggling with how to portray the alien being responsible for the monoliths until they realized it couldn xe be done we don xe know what is out there it would be hubris to even try to imagine
this is not review of the book mr benson is friend of mine and xe unabashedly ignorant of the history of cinema anyway but it is review of my own shifting attitudes and encounters with the movie itself over the years
one mark of the movie xe status as masterpiece is that it has something different to say to us every time we encounter it anew
like the monolith it appears to give us what we need
fifty years ago it was harbinger of the future we were about to win the race with the russians to the moon whole generation was pumped and primed to tune in turn on and transcend the whole dreary space time continuum as we knew it
thoroughly researched by kubrick and clarke large swaths of the film were like documentary of the future the space station the moon base the grand stepping outward just as clarke and people like wernher von braun had prophesied
xe xe comes back at another poignant time in history especially as it relates to space and the cosmos once we got to the moon the script of future history was abandoned by the nixon white house
it xe now been years since there was anyone on the moon it xe possible to imagine time in which there will be no humans alive who have been there
but now the traditional sci fi script has flipped generation of swashbuckling billionaires has taken center stage in the space business as well as new class of wealthy customers who can afford to indulge their services instead of star child these days we have the xe cstar man xe launched into orbit past mars in tesla convertible by elon musk
once wrote that no longer expected bootprints on mars in my lifetime now xe not so sure it xe not crazy to think that private outfits like spacex which seem to be running rings around nasa and congress could beat nasa into deeper space xe happily come out of retirement sometime in the to write the words that humans have landed and walked on mars
not that nasa has credible plans or the prospect of enough money to go anywhere exciting anytime soon under its new administrator jim bridenstine former congressman nasa is taking steps to move forward on long range program of exploration and survey of resources that would lead to the establishment of permanent base there
but mars is having moment in the popular imagination xe from the matt damon film xe cthe martian xe which got high marks for scientific realism couple years ago to an upcoming television series xe cthe first xe about settlers on mars being planned by beau willimon the producer and showrunner of the netflix series xe chouse of cards xe
this week space leaders and enthusiasts gathered in washington for the humans to mars summit sponsored by the aerospace industry the meeting featured the release of report outlining how humans could be on mars as early as
where the script has really flipped is in the future history of evolution
robots have taken over the sacred task of exploring for us increasingly sophisticated and smaller machines have spread out to every world of the solar system buzzing the rings of saturn daring the dark voids beyond pluto and landing on comets scanning the heavens for new planets new places to dream about there have been enough robots landers and orbiters violating the skies and surface of mars to spark legends and myths and paranoia among whatever life forms might be there
the next generation extending our telepresence across the universe will be even smaller and cleverer plans are afoot to send fleets of spaceships the size of iphone chips toward alpha centauri like clouds of butterflies across interstellar space even if our bodies don xe ever cross the voids between the stars our dna surely will in microscopic cascade of space invaders that could still colonize the galaxy
we all carry hal in our pockets now and in few years he it will be in our bloodstreams the future to the extent that humans are part of it is bionic
computers to the delight of surveillance states and the despair of civil libertarians can now recognize faces for all we know neural networks like deep mind can dream
worse we may all be part of the dream the news from some physicists like the late stephen hawking is that the universe might be hologram an illusion like the three dimensional images on bank card some cosmologists have argued that it is not inconsistent xe at least mathematically xe to imagine that the entire universe as we know it could just be computer simulation as in xe cthe matrix xe xe another movie with long shadows in effect we are all made of bits so the argument goes removable deformable at the click of an interstellar mouse
in that case have bone or two to pick with the director

speakers at the new york times international luxury conference held nov in hong kong were asked what will be the luxury industry xe greatest challenge in the next five years and what will be its greatest focus
here xe what they said comments have been edited for length
history provides some interesting insights for us here consumers spend whether the economy is good or bad think what we need is to have the right products at the right time as for qeelin we have never catered to the state of the economy instead what xe important to me is to create something with emotional resonance something that touches hearts something that you wear for the first time and it just feels like it belongs to you an almost inexplicable bond dennis chan founder and creative director of the fine jewelry brand qeelin
the greatest challenge for the next five years will be redefining what it means to be true luxury brand as clients become more discerning and more players enter the luxury market clients will look for redefinition of luxury based on craftsmanship unique artistry scarcity and personalization cindy chao jewelry designer hong kong
experience alone will not be enough in luxury xe it xe fleeting an overused word and everything can be seen as an experience the price is on the breadth of the knowledge capital consumers can continue to gain from your brand that to me is luxury xe greatest new focus adrian cheng founder of the museum retail mall in hong kong and executive vice chairman new world development
it is indeed turbulent world but one that also brings opportunities looking out five years we continue to see both challenges and opportunities in commerce digital innovation globalization and changes in consumer spending habits will continue catapulting the fashion industry into the midst of further seismic shifts
the challenges we foresee will center on the decline of brand loyalty due largely to market fragmentation with large platforms dominating the space consumers will continue to gravitate to the fastest broadest or cheapest hence why the experiential aspect of commerce will become more explored one of the key strategies at fosun is called customer to maker xe essentially digital connection between consumer needs and smart manufacturing
another challenge is fast fashion xe ability to manufacture styles on demand although we tend to think that the pressure from consumers to use ethically sourced and green manufacturing materials and methods should help to counter this little brands have given ethical manufacturing lot of lip service for many years but now the pressure for action and complete transparency is growing joann cheng chairwoman fosun fashion group and chairwoman lanvin
the greatest challenge for the luxury industry over the next five years is keeping up with the rapid pace of change in new retail technologies which will enable luxury brands to engage their consumers in new and innovative ways
the focus of luxury business over the next five years should be working to staying relevant with the percent of the consumers that luxury brands already know and becoming relevant with the percent of the consumer base luxury brands don xe know china michael evans president alibaba
biggest challenge in next five years global recession driven by slowdown in china and withdrawal of central bank support in the united states and europe
greatest new focus proliferation of new indie brands driven by social media and commerce attached to talent and celebrity steve hasker chief executive creative artists agency global
at nike we are privileged to begin every project through the lens of sport it is intrinsically human it is universal we believe and we always have that nike xe strength is in accessing the inherent empathy of our playing field
the future of luxury will be defined by the strength of that relationship nike xe greatest opportunity is to leverage emerging technologies and data driven craft to forge new vision of bespoke xe one where all athletes are able to collaborate directly with nike to solve their discrete problems however big or small with sport as focus this reimagined bespoke is democratic and holds up emotional connection as critical component
with these new connection points nike is positioned to initiate and sustain strong relationships and help all athletes reach for and achieve their goals john hoke iii chief design officer nike
as time is perceived as being ever more critical and precious the brick and mortar shopping experience is in danger particularly as millennials embrace the online shopping experience with which they are so familiar quick poll of millennials with whom interact indicated that they generally purchase percent to percent of non grocery goods over the internet including luxury items
as the technology of delivering information over the internet progresses retailers of luxury goods need to embrace techniques that allow them to both educate and motivate the customer as well as to enhance the convenience of the online shopping experience bruce jones chief executive triton
technology is one of the many factors that will continue to shape the way consumers connect and shop with retailers and brands the path to purchase is not linear and luxury brands will have to continue to adapt and meet consumers wherever they are and how they expect to engage right now that xe across many digital mediums and in stores but the channels will keep evolving what won xe change is the consumer xe desire to engage with stories and content that are inspiring and relevant to them and products and experiences that are authentic distinctive and trustworthy patrice louvet chief executive ralph lauren
as consumers become more impact oriented and demand transparency into the way their items are created the luxury industry will have to prove the provenance of goods and verify they are ethically and sustainably produced blockchain can be used to bring efficiency and transparency to supply chains while eliminating corruptibility as records cannot be improperly changed or deleted beyond benefits to supply chain processes blockchain can also be used to create new incentive structures for both consumers and producers of luxury goods
the luxury industry will have to adapt to conscious consumerism and the increasing demand for luxury purchase to have substantive value beyond aesthetics and craftsmanship consumers will hold brands accountable for the promises they make and companies can employ blockchain to build trust joseph lubin founder of consensys blockchain software technology company and co founder of ethereum an open source blockchain based computing platform
luxury xe greatest challenge in the next five years will be to address the impacts of technology as technology will lead younger generations of consumers away from traditional expectations of retail
luxury xe greatest new focus during this same period will be renewed commitment to outstanding retail experiences
luxury brands will need to reinvent their model of store based retail delivery every physical contact with brand will need to be one of flagship quality scott malkin chairman value retail which specializes in luxury outlet shopping villages
there are many challenges we are going to face because of this increasingly turbulent world but one almost rises to the top technology in all its forms and in all phases of the value chain technology will be strong focus in the luxury industry from the fabrics to the design the manufacturing process to the sales and marketing and customer experience to customer service luxury needs to be faster in adapting its business models to new technology where speed is as crucial as excellence commerce big data blockchain and will take over the industry like it or not and it will change consumers xe experiences and emotions the winning brands cannot rely heavily on innovating with design creativity new disruptive mind set in needed training the entire value chain will be key to the greatest success federica marchionni international chief executive and group chief strategy officer the online luxury fashion retailer secoo
technology will be the biggest disrupter in the luxury industry from design to consumption it will all need fresh wiring and most importantly the future is here sooner than we think darshan mehta president and chief executive reliance brands which has more than brand partnerships in india
the rate of change in terms of customer expectations has become increasingly rapid we always ask ourselves xe chow will the world shop for fashion in five years xe think this has to be the focus for all of us in luxury
today xe digital first customers have been exposed to ultra personalized experiences our favorite apps and internet companies know us our preferences and give us an experience that is truly personalized it is what consumers expect and demand offline retailers know nothing about us and learn nothing about us when we come in and after we leave
this will not last long and we foresee revolution in retail powered by ultra personalization via digital technologies that xe why we are focusing our efforts on an augmented retail vision our store of the future xe to help the world xe greatest luxury brands and retailers to deliver incredible customer experiences across all touchpoints xe monobrand multibrand online and offline jos xc xa neves founder and chief executive the online luxury fashion retailer farfetch
luxury is about aspirations as much as it is about craft product and economics it is hence necessary for us to rise to this position and engage with the world owning up to our impact in it in more proactive way through this period full of turbulence and change while the demands of the market and the transformations of the consumer will force the luxury business to embrace innovation and technology in an ever greater way it is imperative that we leverage this opportunity to deliver more value to both our consumers as well as our stakeholders by widening our understanding of the communities that we serve so that we can continue to perfect the way luxury expresses what we collectively care about leading the charge in achieving sustainable future dee poon managing director brands and distribution the textile manufacturing company esquel group
think the most challenging part of our jobs is to figure out how to keep our brands relevant and meaningful for the future generation of clients
as the world evolves and the clients of the future might adopt set of values different from the ones we have or our parents and grandparents had we should be thinking how to evolve the mission and essence of our brands to ensure their perpetuity daniela riccardi chief executive baccarat
digital has gone from being on the horizon to being where the growth in our industry will come from twenty nine billion dollars in commerce today will become billion by and that xe just the direct sales xe even our in store transactions are influenced by interacting with brands online
we need to focus on the customer experience in the world where customers move seamlessly between our stores and their mobile phones we need to start with the customer journey not the technology our job is not to bring luxury online our job is to make online shopping luxurious ian rogers chief digital officer lvmh mo xc xabt hennessy louis vuitton
as the luxury consumer is taking new form the ability to manage brand xe accessibility xe while maintaining its exclusivity xe will be the key to capturing and nurturing these clients with this shift now more than ever influencers play an essential role in helping brands engage with this customer acting as the middlemen to build relationships on behalf of the brands and serving as the trusted voices that consumers look to
moving forward the brands who will get it right will be those that leverage data and deep learning to more swiftly respond to market trends and drive business decisions with the product launch cycle becoming shorter and shorter staying competitive will mean it xe critical for brands to think about things like understanding audience accuracy and early trend identification to anticipate the needs of the ever changing consumer landscape arnaud roy chief strategy officer launchmetrics technology and data analytics provider
worldwide markets and consumer habits are changing radically and at an unprecedented pace our industry is changing more rapidly than ever before and companies must be ready to react at digital speed in my view to continue to play leading role in the industry today means to be as flexible as possible while keeping strong vision and remaining faithful to the company xe dna
there is no reason to fight the change change must be embraced and welcomed believe that you must be open to change even when you are successful without waiting the problems to come along it xe key to evolve rather than merely adapt
as for luxury xe focus consumers are more and more driven by the experience rather than product only by authentic relationships rather than one way communication patterns it will be essential to constantly fine tune the engagement with customers to become an online offline community sharing the same values and where closeness and quick and real emotional interactions play key role when acquired the company my dream was to make moncler synonym for xe cdown jacket xe my dream today is to make moncler recognizable universe of values and experiences of which people want to be part remo ruffini chairman and chief executive moncler
the greatest challenge is how to exploit the latest in technology to connect to consumers globally
greatest new focus how to customize products services and experience to the specific and evolving needs of each consumer who would demand authenticity and honesty in everything they consume our kids will not buy products without knowing where were these produced who produced them and how did they produce ravi thakran group chairman south and southeast asia australia and the middle east lvmh mo xc xabt hennessy louis vuitton chairman and managing partner the private equity firm catterton asia
in the long run the chinese consumer will continue to be major growth engine for the global luxury industry but their tastes and preferences are changing we at morgan believe that the greatest challenge the international luxury sector will face in the near future is maintaining the attention and interest of the growing chinese wealthy class chinese consumers are starting to show preference for local brands that offer high quality products with designs tailored for unique domestic tastes they are also beginning to hold back on spending as the markets become more volatile
global luxury brands still have significant potential for growth in china but global brands will have to continue to find new ways to attract consumers and maintain their loyalty
china is transitioning into an economy based on experiences think that the greatest new focus for luxury companies operating in china will be to ensure that consumers walk away with unique and memorable experiences in other words consumer satisfaction will not just come from ownership of specific brand but also from the experiences associated with the purchase jing ulrich managing director and vice chairman of asia pacific jpmorgan chase
as gen consumers become increasingly important in terms of buying power and social influence luxury players have to understand their psychologies develop unique products and build authentic communications to engage with them
it is very important to embrace the benefits technology can provide and the tools to capture trends and data effectively data driven analysis linked to commerce channels will be very powerful
we have to pay great attention and learn to understand new emerging markets like china and tailor and localize decisions taking into account the evolving economical cultural and political environment wendy yu founder and chief executive the investment funding company yu holdings

hundreds of google employees upset at the company xe decision to secretly build censored version of its search engine for china have signed letter demanding more transparency to understand the ethical consequences of their work
in the letter which was obtained by the new york times employees wrote that the project and google xe apparent willingness to abide by china xe censorship requirements xe craise urgent moral and ethical issues xe they added xe ccurrently we do not have the information required to make ethically informed decisions about our work our projects and our employment xe
the letter is circulating on google xe internal communication systems and is signed by about employees according to three people familiar with the document who were not authorized to speak publicly
the internal activism presents another obstacle for google xe potential return to china eight years after the company publicly withdrew from the country in protest of censorship and government hacking china has the world xe largest internet audience but has frustrated american tech giants with content restrictions or outright blockages of services including facebook and instagram
it is also the latest example of how google xe outspoken work force has agitated for changes to strategy in april the internet company xe employees spoke out against its involvement in pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence to improve weaponry by june google had said it would not renew contract with the pentagon for work
google xe interest in bringing search back to china came to the forefront earlier this month when reports surfaced that the company was working on search app that restricts content banned by beijing the project known internally as dragonfly was developed largely in secret prompting outrage among employees who worried they had been unwittingly working on technology that would help china withhold information from its citizens
xe cwe urgently need more transparency seat at the table and commitment to clear and open processes google employees need to know what we xe re building xe the letter said
the letter also called on google to allow employees to participate in ethical reviews of the company xe products to appoint external representatives to ensure transparency and to publish an ethical assessment of controversial projects the document referred to the situation as code yellow process used in engineering to address critical problems that impact several teams
google declined to comment on the letter it has said in the past that it will not comment on dragonfly or xe cspeculation about future plans xe
late on thursday employees pressed google xe chief executive sundar pichai and other management about dragonfly at weekly staff meeting as of late wednesday one of the top questions on an internal software system called dory which lets employees vote for the queries that executives should answer at the meeting asked whether google had lost its ethical compass said people who had reviewed the questions other questions on dory asked directly about the dragonfly project and specific information that may be censored by the chinese government such as air pollution data
xe cif we were to do our mission well we are to think seriously about how to do more in china xe mr pichai said in the staff meeting audio of which was obtained by the times xe cthat said we are not close to launching search product in china xe
mr pichai and sergey brin co founder of google stopped answering questions about dragonfly after seeing their answers posted on twitter
this week xe staff meeting was the first opportunity for google xe work force to ask executives about dragonfly because the meeting was not held last week the absence of gathering xe the result of regularly scheduled break in the summer according to company spokesman rob shilkin xe led to fears among employees that leadership was becoming less transparent following several controversies over google xe government work
google has traditionally been more responsive to employee concerns and more transparent about future projects and inner workings than other major technology companies inviting questions from workers at its staff meetings and encouraging internal debate
the internal dissent over dragonfly comes on the heels of the employee protests over google xe involvement in the pentagon project to use artificial intelligence after google said it would not renew its contract with the pentagon it unveiled series of ethical principles governing its use of
in those principles google publicly committed to use only in xe csocially beneficial xe ways that would not cause harm and promised to develop its capabilities in accordance with human rights law some employees have raised concerns that helping china suppress the free flow of information would violate these new principles
in google said it had discovered that chinese hackers had attacked the company xe corporate infrastructure in an attempt to access to the gmail accounts of human rights activists the attack combined with government censorship propelled google to pull its search engine from the country
the exit from china was seminal moment for the company xe symbol of its uncompromising idealism captured by google xe unofficial motto of xe cdon xe be evil xe at the time chinese internet users marked the loss of google xe search engine by laying flowers at the company xe beijing offices in what became known as an xe illegal flower tribute xe possible re entry to china according to current and former employees is sign of more mature and pragmatic company
hundreds of employees at the tech company urged their leadership to be more transparent about its ethics and its use of artificial intelligence
google has maintained significant presence in china even though its flagship services are not accessible in the country last year google announced plans for research center in china focused on artificial intelligence and it has introduced translation and file management apps for the chinese market google now has more than employees in china
google xe work on dragonfly is not guarantee that its search engine will be welcomed back to china the government would have to approve its return and it has kept american technology firms like facebook at arm xe length opting instead to work closely with homegrown internet behemoths
some employees are in favor of re entering china arguing that exiting the country in protest of censorship has done little to pressure beijing to change its position while it has made google nonessential among the world xe largest base of internet users
when google pulled out of china in mr brin said it objected to the country xe xe ctotalitarian xe policies when it came to censorship political speech and internet communications if anything china has only tightened its controls in the last eight years xe leaving the company in bind for how to justify its return
xe cyou can never satisfy censor particularly the ones in china xe said charles mok member of the hong kong legislative council who advocates and represents the information technology sector and who is affiliated with the territory xe democratic camp
google is probably facing intense pressure to introduce more of its products in china mr mok said but added that the company would lend legitimacy to government censorship if it debuted censored search product in china
xe cthen the chinese government can say xe google is with it too xe xe he said

for giving somebody the shivers brushes are tools of choice january performance of whisperlodge begins in dimly lit brooklyn living room where man and woman dressed in white run fat makeup brushes in slow circles over another woman xe bare back spacey synthesizer chords drone from speakers at the front of the room while the four audience members watch from armchairs or cream colored sofa
performers then lead participants individually into private rooms for various one on one sensory experiences during the minute show scenes include sitting at table while someone crinkles paper in your ears visiting xe cdoctor xe office xe having your face stroked with makeup brushes and hair brushing encounter
whisperlodge is an unusual mixture of theater and therapy every few months usually in rented or borrowed apartment audience members show up and pay to to experience scenes presented by semiregular cast of performers and designed to elicit autonomous sensory meridian response more commonly known as the suddenly popular phenomenon in which gentle sounds or touch make some people feel relaxing tingles at the back of the skull
has huge following online where hundreds of thousands of fans watch videos of people performing soothing activities to help them sleep or relax or to ease anxiety whisperlodge founded by melinda lauw an artist and andrew hoepfner who creates immersive theater is one of the first in person experiences in the world and it xe starting to draw crowds one intimate audience at time the group says it has sold out all runs of performances since launching in brooklyn in including six events in california and few xe cwhispers on demand xe sessions that are more spa treatment than performance where people pay and up for one on one customized relaxation sessions its creators hope to tour whisperlodge internationally
once the term gained currency it was coined in online forum fans started youtube channels dedicated to triggering the sensation people report feeling from everything from scalp massages xe or watching other people get them xe to the sound of fingernails tapping on wood videos typically feature woman speaking close to camera and barely above whisper often pretending to be care provider like makeup artist or physician tapping scratching and crinkling sounds abound today the top youtube channels draw over million subscribers
the shenandoah university physiologist craig richard first heard the term in on podcast he developed an online survey for people who experience the feeling and introduced the website asmr university to compile research on the subject he compares the behavior demonstrated in videos to that of parent comforting an infant soft voice focused attention and caring gaze
video as medium for may appeal to anxiety sufferers because the viewer is in full control xe cthe stranger in video xe they can xe harm you xe dr richard said by phone in his survey however participants xe favorite stimulus is touch something available only in person for them there xe whisperlodge
xe ctoday xe like to share this hairbrush with you xe ms lauw said during the last of january shows welcoming each audience member to room bathed in soft gold light she perched on the edge of the bed and stroked the brush xe rubber bristles and wooden handle participants leave her room with hair thoroughly detangled and perhaps in state of zombielike relaxation
for those who don xe get xe ctingles xe watching someone caress the handle of hairbrush would seem indisputably bizarre yet devotees aren xe hallucinating
xe cit xe absolutely real thing xe said stephen smith psychologist at the university of winnipeg who has used fmri machines to scan the brains of people who experience the sensation he found neural networks firing differently in people who feel than in the general population xe cit seems to be affecting so many different people and for the most part it xe affecting them in positive way xe
in youtube comments someone will occasionally ask whether videos are meant to be pornographic after all some fans refer to the feeling as xe cbrain orgasm xe and in videos beautiful women whisper softly to the camera while porn may ultimately be in the eye of the beholder viewers who use the videos for relaxation are adamant their goal is the opposite of arousal dr richard finds the xe corgasm xe descriptor misleading xe cthe pleasure of is more like the warm comfort of sitting on couch with best friend close family member or romantic partner xe he said by email xe cyou feel relaxed carefree and safe xe
xe cmany of the videos seem intimate although the intimacy appears to be more socially voyeuristic rather than sexually voyeuristic in nature xe dr smith said however he added if you dig into the online subculture of you can find the occasional not safe for work video which suggests there is subset of the community that uses for sexual stimulation
while there haven xe been studies to test the benefits of and performers aren xe licensed to administer tingles dr smith says the experience of it shares characteristics like intense focus and relaxation with meditation therapeutic application is not out of the question xe cif can understand more about how these people can experience positive emotions and relaxation it provides us with more opportunities to design programs that will help people increase their well being xe he said
perhaps future research will also reveal what makes fake doctor xe visit soothing to some
chia lynn kwa friend of ms lauw xe and graphic designer by day played the physician in january xe whisperlodge where she stroked guests xe ears with tip and pretended to scan their body using buzzing electric toothbrush like wand she said audience members seemed at ease taking direction from an authority figure even pretend one
xe ci think part of it is that lot of people think it xe kind of comforting to just be told what to do xe ms kwa said
mark harris who was in the audience and works for an interactive design studio in manhattan feels from touch not through videos so an in person experience was ideal for him referring to the tip in the doctor xe scene he said xe cthose types of touch trigger it very powerfully xe
also at the performance was mr harris xe wife nicole arendt new york city public school teacher ms arendt does not feel herself xe cbut am interested in heightened senses xe she said adding that the hair brushing evoked nostalgic memories of her mother and sister
not all audience members have enjoyed the show ms lauw says some people have no idea what xe going on xe cyou can tell from their reactions that they xe re like xe ooh this is weird xe xe she said sometimes people don xe want to be touched at all in these cases cast members perform the actions on themselves performers ask for consent before touching people
in one scene pamela martinez composer who joined whisperlodge after organizing several sound bath meditation sessions with mr hoepfner presents tray of makeup brushes and invites guest to choose one she will use to stroke their face she acknowledged it was weird at first to get so close to stranger xe cnot everybody xe willing and able to access that part of themselves xe ms martinez said xe cbut lot of people are just waiting for the invitation xe
of course it xe faux intimacy forged at whisperlodge only slightly more real than watching someone pretend to care for you on youtube dr smith said that in spite of the relaxation it seems to provide its fans could be part larger pattern of people isolating themselves in the digital age xe cthere xe so much online that allows you to not actually interact with other human beings yet still feel close xe artificially close xe to other people does that xe he said
in this vein dr richard compares to vitamins it shouldn xe be the only source of human closeness although it could be healthy supplement to real intimacy
emma smith who runs whispersred an youtube account with more than subscribers has led live meditations in britain and in san francisco as partnership with whisperlodge to her meeting other fans in person is the best possible outcome of the online phenomenon xe cyou xe ve found something you enjoy and helps you sleep but you xe ve also found community of people who are just like you xe she said via skype xe cconnect with those people realize you xe re not alone the internet is in danger of stopping us from being human we need to use it to be more human not the other way around xe

tony west uber xe chief legal officer and former justice department official is navigating the ride hailing giant xe numerous legal issues
part of tony west xe mandate in his job as chief legal officer is to help reduce uber xe various legal entanglements credit credit carlos chavarr xc xada for the new york times
supported by
by kate conger
san francisco xe not long after tony west joined uber as chief legal officer in november he began delicate task crafting transparency report to quantify how many people had been sexually assaulted during uber rides
the effort was part of mr west xe mandate to help clean up uber which had been grappling with legal entanglements safety issues and problematic workplace culture
so mr west directed uber employees to work with the national sexual violence resource center nonprofit to review instances of sexual misconduct that occurred during rides in he listened to customer service calls including one in which an uber driver said he had raped passenger and the company began auditing past complaints to determine whether it had evidence of old assaults
nearly months later the work is far from over xe cthis is hugely underreported set of situations xe mr west said xe cthose numbers as we continue to count them they actually might go up xe
since dara khosrowshahi uber xe chief executive brought in mr west to help turn around the ride hailing company and professionalize it the attorney has swept aside many of its highest profile legal woes while uber is still dealing with hundreds of legal cases mr west settled tabloid worthy trade secrets lawsuit last year by alphabet xe self driving car business waymo and negotiated multistate settlement over vast data breach
but the sexual assault transparency report which mr west plans to release this year underlines just how much more work uber needs to do xe and how thorny the challenge can be to navigate
xe che is very upfront about the fact that it xe not going to be pretty xe tammy albarran uber xe deputy general counsel said of mr west and the transparency report
the work is especially important as uber gears up for highly anticipated initial public offering lyft uber xe main rival in the united states made its offering prospectus public on friday and is likely to begin trading on the stock market next month
uber which may go public at billion valuation would dwarf lyft but to pull off successful offering the company must reduce its legal exposure and show that it has revamped its culture and cares about the safety of passengers
mr west former justice department official and the brother in law of senator kamala harris the california democrat who is running for president said he was hitching his reputation to uber and its changes
xe ci had reputation that was also putting on the table right xe he said in recent interview
native of the bay area mr west graduated from harvard university and stanford law school he rose to prominence as an assistant attorney general in the obama administration during which he urged the justice department to stop defending the defense of marriage act and worked to reduce the number of detainees in the military prison at guant xc xa namo bay
in he became general counsel of pepsico where he said he learned how to operate in fortune company then in mr khosrowshahi came calling
at the time uber was reeling from the ouster of travis kalanick as chief executive and the aftermath of an investigation into its workplace amid other issues mr khosrowshahi was tapped to stabilize the company and eventually take it public over several dinners in new york he pitched mr west on the idea of turning uber into more self critical company
uber needed someone with xe ca great amount of negotiation prowess and relationships xe mr khosrowshahi said xe che xe got both xe
mr west jumped ship xe cthere was nothing was going to do that was going to fundamentally change the trajectory xe of pepsico he said
at uber mr west began rebuilding the legal department with several former justice department colleagues he also confronted some urgent legal problems they included trial in early to defend the company against allegations that it had stolen trade secrets from waymo in the race to build self driving cars
the weekend before the trial started that february mr west met with waymo xe lawyers to settle the case the conversation ended in an impasse
after the trial opened embarrassing revelations about uber quickly tumbled out mr west said that he had texted kevin vosen waymo xe general counsel from the courtroom and that the two had met during breaks to keep trying for settlement waymo declined to comment on mr vosen xe conversations with mr west
four days after the trial began the two sides struck deal uber agreed to provide waymo which had sought billion in damages with percent of its stock valued then at million as well as the right to inspect uber xe self driving technology
at the same time mr west worked to placate investigators who were digging into the data breach which uber had kept secret and which had prompted numerous state lawsuits for violation of data breach notification laws mr west said he had kept in frequent contact with lisa madigan who was the illinois attorney general to hash out settlement the two had worked together while he was at the justice department
ms madigan said that being friends with mr west xe cin some ways makes it easier xe to negotiate xe cwe both know the law we both know the problem and we both know there needs to be resolution xe she said
in september mr west and ms madigan agreed that uber would pay million to all states to settle the data breach investigation
mr west also worked with mr khosrowshahi to change uber xe culture last year mr west helped uber settle million pay discrimination lawsuit by three former female employees and he helped settle lawsuit by nine women who had been raped kidnapped assaulted or harassed by drivers the company declined to disclose the terms of the deal
eric holder jr the former attorney general who led an inquiry into uber xe workplace in and is friends with mr west said of the company xe cthey still have work to do but made really significant progress in short period of time xe
some of the work today revolves around the sexual assault transparency report uber is now training its customer service representatives to sort incidents into categories the process is complex for instance uber considers touch between person xe thighs to be sexual while touch on other areas of the thigh is not
because the company operates in countries the training must also be localized that is tricky because of varied cultural norms xe kiss on the cheek might be common greeting in europe but would be unexpected in the united states mr west noted
xe cthere are these differing concepts and views about what can be considered intimate or sexual or appropriate or inappropriate xe he said
how long mr west will stay at uber is unclear he has already faced questions internally about whether he will leave to join ms harris xe presidential campaign mr west is married to maya harris senator harris xe sister and campaign chairwoman he also co led ms harris xe transition team after she was elected to the senate in
ms harris xe office did not respond to requests for comment
when asked if he would return to government mr west demurred and said presidential victory for ms harris would most likely prevent him from working in the administration because he was relative
xe cit would depend on lot of things not the least of which is what would be going back for xe he said
an earlier version of this article misstated the number and nature of incidents reviewed by uber and the national sexual violence resource center the review involves incidents not they involved different types of sexual misconduct they did not all involve sexual assault

san francisco xe uber said its autonomous vehicles returned to public roads on thursday nine months after one of its self driving cars killed pedestrian in tempe ariz
but uber xe driverless vehicles are operating at drastically reduced speeds and in less challenging environments than before the company said as it eases back into testing and tries to ensure people xe safety
xe cwe will continue to prioritize safety and proactively communicate our progress until we xe ve built self driving system that lives up to the promise of making transportation safer and more affordable for everyone xe eric meyhofer who leads uber xe autonomous vehicle unit said in statement
uber said it received permission on monday from the pennsylvania department of transportation to test its driverless cars again on public roads in pittsburgh the company said it planned to put fewer than five cars on the road on thursday and slowly add to that over time
each car will have two drivers inside ready to take over in case something goes wrong uber said the operators will work in four hour shifts down from eight to hours previously no passengers will ride in the cars
the autonomous cars will also go no faster than miles an hour down from as fast as before they will operate only on limited loop in pittsburgh xe strip district bustling commercial area and only during daylight hours on weekdays uber said
the self driving future is still years away so some autonomous tech companies are trying smaller vehicles
uber said it was also putting autonomous vehicles back on the streets in toronto and san francisco although those cars will operate in manual mode which means human driver will control the vehicles xe movements rather than software
the company had grounded its fleet of autonomous vehicles in march after one of its cars xe with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel xe struck and killed elaine herzberg on street in tempe
getting the cars back on the road since then has been difficult as uber worked to make its cars safer it lowered its expectations for speed and performance the new york times previously reported even so the cars struggled to pass safety tests last month the cars were still failing out of safety tests according to internal documents
the safety overhaul xe crequired lot of introspection and took some time xe mr meyhofer said xe cnow we are ready to move forward xe
uber xe autonomous vehicle group will most likely face intense scrutiny over the next several months the national transportation safety board xe investigation into the fatal arizona crash is still open
uber has pitched autonomous vehicles as way to reduce the fees it pays to human drivers but the company is still spending heavily on developing and testing the cars dara khosrowshahi uber xe chief executive has been focused on winnowing unprofitable businesses ahead of taking the company public next year

in xe cdeep medicine xe dr eric topol looks at the ways that could improve health care and where it might stumble
by anahad xe connor
last month president trump signed an executive order making the development and regulation of artificial intelligence federal priority but one area where artificial intelligence is already taking hold is health care
doctors are already using to spot potentially lethal lesions on mammograms scientists are also developing systems that can diagnose common childhood conditions predict whether person will develop alzheimer xe disease and monitor people with conditions like multiple sclerosis and parkinson xe disease
dr eric topol cardiologist and the founder and director of the scripps research translational institute has long heralded this convergence of technology and medicine now in new book called xe deep medicine how artificial intelligence can make healthcare human again xe dr topol explores how is likely to transform almost everything that doctors do
dr topol believes that can do more than enhance diagnoses and treatments it can also save doctors from doing tasks like taking notes and reading scans allowing them to spend more time connecting with their patients recently we caught up with dr topol to discuss his thoughts on where has the most potential to improve health care where it might stumble and how it could protect doctors from things like burnout and depression here are edited excerpts from our interview
can help to lower america xe soaring health care costs
yes the no line item of health care cost in america is human resources which has recently grown xe as of december towering over retail xe to be the leading job source for our economy by augmenting human performance has the potential to markedly improve productivity efficiency work flow accuracy and speed both for doctors and for patients giving more charge and control to consumers through algorithmic support of their data
can you talk about the area of medicine where shows the most promise
there are few key areas one is machine pattern recognition to promote the rapid and accurate reading of medical scans slides skin lesions the pickup of small polyps during colonoscopy and much more another is keyboard liberation or using natural language processing of speech to synthesize notes and eliminate the ultimate source of distraction and dislike in medical encounters can also predict key outcomes for both patients and clinicians to promote prevention
where is most likely to fail
there xe no shortage of deep liabilities for in health care the liabilities include breaches of privacy and security hacking the lack of explainability of most algorithms the potential to worsen inequities the embedded bias and ethical quandaries
in your book you talk lot about the rapid growth of companies in the radiology space will make radiologists obsolete
absolutely not wrote about new role for radiologists whereby they come out of the basement and have direct interactions with patients we can xe and will never rely on only algorithms for interpretation of life and death matters that requires human expert contextualization something machines can xe do
can you share your thoughts on one or two of the most innovative or impressive companies you xe ve come across
don xe think there xe standout just yet for start ups admire the way alivecor with their mayo clinic collaboration was able to develop deep learning algorithms to determine person xe blood potassium levels via smartwatch ecg signal for tech titans google ai and its deepmind division has done some impressive work that includes accurately triaging urgent eye conditions predicting outcomes in the hospital setting and an important prospective study of pathology slides in cancer
you xe ve long been big fan of personalized nutrition will we ever get to point where can determine the best diet for every individual
there are emerging data to support this possibility such as avoiding glucose spikes after eating which are highly individualized much more common than anticipated and related to the specific foods we take in and our gut microbiomes it xe still early but definitely getting traction from ongoing work
in the future will assisted robots replace surgeons
no way can help the precision of delicate microsurgery as we have already seen with the retina there will be better robots for surgery than we have now but that won xe obviate the need for human surgeons it will just augment their performance would you want your surgery to be done by robot
studies show that can detect depression by scanning person xe instagram photos could be game changer for the mental health field
yes but not via your instagram posts for the first time we xe ve got real time objective metrics for state of mind and mood like tone of speech breathing pattern smartphone keystrokes and communication and physical activity and we xe ve learned people would rather share their innermost secrets with an avatar compared with human being so the landscape is ripe for to help alleviate the profound shortage of health professionals compared with the enormous burden of depression and other mental health conditions
what are you most excited about with in health care is there anything that worries you
what xe most excited about is using the future to bring back the past to restore the care in health care by giving both the gift of time to clinicians who are at peak levels ever recorded for burnout and depression and empowerment to patients for those who want it this will ultimately be possible but it will require substantial activism of the medical community to stand up for patients and not allow the jump in productivity to further squeeze clinicians upending the erosion of the doctor patient relationship

palo alto calif xe inside an old auto body shop here in silicon valley stefan avalos pushed movie camera down dolly track
he and small crew were making short film about self driving cars they were shooting powder blue austin mini but through special effects the rusted relic would be transformed into an autonomous vehicle that looked more like the delorean from xe cback to the future xe
stepping back from the camera mr avalos referred wryly to the movie he was filming as xe cproject unemployment xe the film was way of testing new technology from start up called arraiy which is trying to automate the creation of digital effects for movies television and games
this new type of artificial intelligence which is also being developed by the software giant adobe and in other technology industry research labs could ultimately replace many of the specialists who build such effects
xe cthis is no joke it will put people out of work xe said mr avalos los angeles based filmmaker who also runs visual effects house xe cthe artists are safe but it will replace all the drudgery xe
over the past three decades computer generated imagery has transformed how movies and television are made but building digital effects is still painstaking and enormously tedious process for every second of movie time armies of designers can spend hours isolating people and objects in raw camera footage digitally building new images from scratch and combining the two as seamlessly as possible
arraiy pronounced xe carray xe is building systems that can handle at least part of this process the company xe founders gary bradski and ethan rublee also created industrial perception one of several robotics start ups snapped up by google several years ago
xe cfilmmakers can do this stuff but they have to do it by hand xe said mr bradski neuroscientist and computer vision specialist with long history in silicon valley he has worked with companies as varied as the chip maker intel and the augmented reality start up magic leap
backed by more than million in financing from the silicon valley venture firm lux capital softbank ventures and others arraiy is part of widespread effort spanning industry and academia and geared toward building systems that can generate and manipulate images on their own
thanks to improvements in so called neural networks xe complex algorithms that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data xe these systems can edit noise and mistakes out of images or apply simple effects and create highly realistic images of very fake people or help graft one person xe head onto the body of someone else
inside arraiy xe offices xe the old auto body shop xe mr bradski and mr rublee are building computer algorithms that can learn design tasks by analyzing years of work by movie effects houses that includes systems that learn to xe crotoscope xe raw camera footage carefully separating people and objects from their backgrounds so that they can be dropped onto new backgrounds
adobe which makes many of the software tools used by today xe designers is also exploring so called machine learning that can automate similar tasks
at industrial perception mr rublee helped develop computer vision for robots designed to perform tasks like loading and unloading freight trucks not long after google acquired the start up work on neural networks took off inside the tech giant in about two weeks team of google researchers xe ctrained xe neural network that outperformed technology from the start up that had taken years to create
mr rublee and mr bradski collected decade of rotoscoping and other visual effects work from various design houses which they declined to identify and they are adding their own work to the collection after filming people mannequins and other objects in front of classic xe cgreen screen xe for example company engineers can quickly rotoscope thousands of images relatively quickly to be added to the data collection once the algorithm is trained it can rotoscope images without help from green screen
the technology still has flaws and in some cases human designers still make adjustments to the automated work but it is improving
xe cthese methods are still rough around the edges xe there is still long tail of things that can go wrong in unpredictable ways xe but there aren xe any fundamental roadblocks xe said phillip isola computer vision researcher at and openai the artificial intelligence lab created by tesla xe chief executive elon musk and others
mr avalos thinks this work could ultimately supplant work done by his own effects house but he is comfortable with that he already farms out many of the more tedious tasks via the internet to workers in other countries
as hardware improves these methods will help generate preliminary effects right on the movie set giving filmmakers better idea of what the finished product will look like mr bradski said the mill an effects house based in london recently used arraiy xe technology to create system that could instantly apply effects that change the look of an automobile
if tech companies can help automate some of the grunt work involved in creating special effects creative people will have chance to try new things said pasha shapiro filmmaker and special effects artist who has also worked with arraiy
xe csome work is so tedious that it is not practical xe he said xe cthat is where technology can help even more xe

mr friedman is professor and director of the policing project at new york university school of law
the supreme court decided on friday that before the government can get your cellphone location records xe well at least more than six days xe worth of them xe it must have probable cause to think you did something wrong and warrant
that xe important because your cellphone is mini gps device broadcasting your location constantly it provides as the court majority recognized xe ca comprehensive chronicle of the user xe past movements xe yet before this decision law enforcement agencies were gathering this data on countless people without even showing that the person whose information they collected had done anything wrong
but the decision in the case carpenter the united states should give you little comfort the growing use of technology by law enforcement agencies to monitor or target people xe particularly people and communities of color xe is expanding at head spinning speed and nothing the courts do is going to stop that
this decision written by chief justice john roberts jr only confirms that his opinion didn xe overturn the rule that says that any time the government wants information on you that you xe ve provided to third party the government can get it even though in the digital age most of your information is now in the hands of third parties like cellphone companies internet providers and social media giants like facebook he stressed how xe cnarrow xe the decision was and didn xe rule out giving the government freedom to track you for up to six days
worse yet if the court loses one of its liberal justices this decision could be reeled back in an instant since it was the court xe four liberals who joined with the chief justice for the majority three of the four dissenting conservative justices in an opinion by justice anthony kennedy even opined remarkably that xe ca person xe movements are not particularly private xe
and two of them would even have wound back the law by more than years to say the fourth amendment no longer protects xe creasonable expectations of privacy xe but only property rights leaving us without constitutional recourse for all of our digital information
what we need is regulation and fast and it is going to have to come from the local state and federal governments not the courts even justice samuel alito in his dissent understood that xe clegislation is much preferable xe he said that was xe cfor many reasons including the enormous complexity of the subject the need to respond to rapidly changing technology and the fourth amendment xe scope xe
almost every day brings another story of how policing technology is chiseling away at our civil rights and liberties license plate readers already record our movements on the ground drones will soon peer down at us from the skies artificial intelligence will power facial recognition tools in cctv and police body cameras to identify us as we move about algorithms will target where crime will supposedly occur next and who might commit it all of these technologies will be in the hands of government agencies that have the power to keep us under watch to handcuff us to lock us up
there is promise in these technologies to be sure drones can locate missing child or map traffic accident from the sky so that cars and trucks aren xe stuck for hours pod cameras xe short for police observation devices affixed to utility or traffic poles or buildings xe can catch criminals in the act in violence torn neighborhoods location tracking of cellphones can identify serial armed robbers
for all of its benefits however policing technology can also do unfathomable damage
let xe start with the obvious it will cut deeply into our privacy it was designed to do just that we xe re told technology will pick out the bad guy from crowd but if you xe re in the crowd too you xe ll be observed we xe ll all be under the government xe watchful eye
but the impact inevitably is going to fall most heavily on minorities and marginalized communities
some of the technology has racial injustice baked into it algorithms don xe have to look at race to be racist whether written by humans or product of machine learning algorithms take past facts and magnify them into future police actions they rely heavily on criminal records much of street policing in recent years xe stop and frisk marijuana enforcement catching fare beaters xe has been deployed disproportionately against minorities and in poor neighborhoods police may xe cgo where the crime is xe but because so much focus has been on low level offenses in disadvantaged areas that are ignored elsewhere these algorithms make it inevitable that the police will return to these places time and again
so what xe to be done
as carpenter makes clear looking to the courts won xe be helpful with rare exception the courts have waved green flag at police surveillance the fourth amendment prohibits xe cunreasonable searches and seizures xe but if government action is not considered search or seizure there is no protection at all the fight in carpenter took place because the use of most of these new technologies isn xe considered search that xe because you have no xe creasonable expectation of privacy xe in public places this makes you fair game for all kinds of surveillance from facial recognition to cctv cameras and warrants and probable cause xe the usual tools of courts xe won xe work anyway when the goal is to keep us all under watch
we need rules that maximize the use of the technology of which we approve but that sharply curtail the risks in some cases we may want to rule out the technology for law enforcement use altogether but for technologies we might allow here are some basic guidelines
first no policing technology should be used unless the public has voice in the decision to authorize it
second citizens can xe make intelligent decisions about policing technology unless they understand what the technology does and how it works police buy technology from private vendors that want to keep its details secret for proprietary reasons that won xe fly when the technology is being used by our government on us
third we need clear rules about deploying policing technology when it can and can xe be used how each use is authorized and by whom drones to map traffic accidents sure to peer into windows of homes no way surveillance devices to locate cellphones yes but only with the appropriate court orders predictive policing to identify places where crime might occur next perhaps but not if there xe chance these algorithms will perpetuate the racially disparate impact of policing
officers using these technologies need proper training and law enforcement agencies should not be allowed to use them unless they can show they understand what they are buying
fourth if data is being collected sharp clear limits on its use must be defined how long can this data be retained can it be shared with other agencies or combined with other data purchased from private vendors
finally strong oversight is critical the police must be closely monitored in their use of these technologies and data on their performance must be disclosed regularly
there are powerfully hard questions here but courts aren xe going to answer them and we can xe continue to duck them we need to act now because the technology is getting away from us fast and the unregulated harms could be devastating

the technology inside amazon xe new convenience store opening monday in downtown seattle enables shopping experience like no other xe including no checkout lines
by nick wingfield
seattle xe the first clue that there xe something unusual about amazon xe store of the future hits you right at the front door it feels as if you are entering subway station row of gates guard the entrance to the store known as amazon go allowing in only people with the store xe smartphone app
inside is an square foot mini market packed with shelves of food that you can find in lot of other convenience stores xe soda potato chips ketchup it also has some food usually found at whole foods the supermarket chain that amazon owns
but the technology that is also inside mostly tucked away out of sight enables shopping experience like no other there are no cashiers or registers anywhere shoppers leave the store through those same gates without pausing to pull out credit card their amazon account automatically gets charged for what they take out the door
on monday the store will open to the public for the first time gianna puerini the executive in charge of amazon go recently gave tours of the store in downtown seattle this is look at what shoppers will encounter
there are no shopping carts or baskets inside amazon go since the checkout process is automated what would be the point of them anyway instead customers put items directly into the shopping bag they xe ll walk out with
every time customers grab an item off shelf amazon says the product is automatically put into the shopping cart of their online account if customers put the item back on the shelf amazon removes it from their virtual basket
the only sign of the technology that makes this possible floats above the store shelves xe arrays of small cameras hundreds of them throughout the store amazon won xe say much about how the system works other than to say it involves sophisticated computer vision and machine learning software translation amazon xe technology can see and identify every item in the store without attaching special chip to every can of soup and bag of trail mix
there were little over million cashiers in the united states in xe and some of their jobs may be in jeopardy if the technology behind amazon go eventually spreads for now amazon says its technology simply changes the role of employees xe the same way it describes the impact of automation on its warehouse workers
xe cwe xe ve just put associates on different kinds of tasks where we think it adds to the customer experience xe ms puerini said
those tasks include restocking shelves and helping customers troubleshoot any technical problems store employees mill about ready to help customers find items and there is kitchen next door with chefs preparing meals for sale in the store because there are no cashiers an employee sits in the wine and beer section of the store checking before customers can take alcohol off the shelves
most people who spend any time in supermarket understand how vexing the checkout process can be with clogged lines for cashiers and customers who fumble with self checkout kiosks
at amazon go checking out feels like xe there xe no other way to put it xe shoplifting it is only few minutes after walking out of the store when amazon sends an electronic receipt for purchases that the feeling goes away
actual shoplifting is not easy at amazon go with permission from amazon tried to trick the store xe camera system by wrapping shopping bag around four pack of vanilla soda while it was still on shelf tucking it under my arm and walking out of the store amazon charged me for it
big unanswered question is where amazon plans to take the technology it won xe say whether it plans to open more amazon go stores or leave this as one of kind novelty more intriguing possibility is that it could use the technology inside whole foods stores though ms puerini said amazon has xe cno plans xe to do so
there xe even speculation that amazon could sell the system to other retailers much as it sells its cloud computing services to other companies for now visitors to amazon go may want to watch their purchases without register staring them in the face at checkout it xe easy to overspend

humans are still the primary source of design but machines are learning how to foresee trends
when thailand xe king bhumibol adulyadej died in october low to mid end hong kong fashion brand sold out of black shirts and white ones xef xbc the colors of respect worn during the official mourning period xef xbc almost overnight
that prompted designers and merchandisers to begin wondering whether such color focused shopping sprees could be predicted
traditionally industry experts predict fashion trends based on their own experiences and sense of style these days however social media xe impact on consumers xe behavior comes into play and fashion industry revolution is underway with help from artificial intelligence technologies
xe cwe intend to provide real time estimation of fashion color trends by using big data from social media xe said gloria yao director of project development at the hong kong research institute of textiles and apparel who is working with team that is developing an ai based color prediction model
yao said sales prediction is very important for fashion businesses as it makes for effective inventory management which increases profits by reducing markdowns due to overstocking
social media impact according to report by advertising agency pmx which is based in the united states social media posts drive percent of website traffic to luxury brands with facebook the platform that drives the most sales
that prompted yao and her team to focus on hundreds of influential fashion industry accounts on facebook including over fashion brands fashion magazines designers and social media celebrities to qualify as influential yao said brand should have at least followers magazine followers and designer or celebrity followers in addition the accounts should be updated frequently and be able to spark community conversations
xe cthe aim is to capture the ongoing social and cultural events from social media posts and validate their impact on consumers xe color preferences xe yao said
an ai technology known as natural language processing interprets the text and images in facebook posts and helps to identify xe cauthentic fashion posts xe related to color
xe cif celebrity says xe xe walking on red carpet at film festival xe the xe red xe here has nothing to do with fashion xe yao explained xe cbut if she says xe like my red colored dress today xe then this xe red xe is the target of our data collection xe
the institute works with well known hong kong fashion brand that provides its data on sales inventories prices shop locations and marketing information
yao xe team found correlation when comparing data from facebook posts with that from the brand with color trend starting on facebook ahead of an uptick in sales xe cif we can determine the time gap between the two trends and their relationship we will have more accurate color predictions xe yao said historical data reveal an average accuracy of about percent but this may improve as data are updated more often
the project will finish in april when production license will be introduced and commercialized for application in the industry
at present yao said the color prediction model fits different brands xe cbut with some adjustments xe the reason is that different brands may target consumers with varying color preferences
applying ai to makeup more fashion brands are applying ai technologies cosmetics giant xe oreal has smartphone app that allows customers to xe ctry on xe lipsticks eyeshadow and eyelash styles luxury brands like burberry give shoppers intelligent advice on which fashion items suit them best
xe cai enhancements will go beyond the traditional areas of machine tasks into creative and customer interaction processes blurring the line between technology and creativity xe management consulting firm mckinsey amp company said in report on fashion trends this year
fashion is about design and the customer xe emotions and mood xef xbc combining physical materials with human senses so how can it be read by machine
the first step said calvin wong professor at hong kong polytechnic university xe institute of textiles and clothing is to teach the machine to analyze fashion image that ensures xe cthe machine understands the fashion world xe said wong who is leading team of dozen researchers that is working with alibaba group to enhance the search functions on its taobao commerce platform
the biggest challenge facing taobao is the sheer chaos of products that have not been properly tagged said jia menglei senior engineer at alibaba with customers complaining that it xe hard to find what they xe re looking for
li yuan and keen online shopper said xe cthere are just tons of items on taobao often have to spend hours on it selecting what need sometimes it makes me feel dizzy xe
jia said using data set of fashion attributes produced by wong xe team will make tagging more exact and predictable allowing alibaba to xe crebuild the world map of consumer goods xe
understanding images apparel comes in innumerable patterns each with different characteristics and elements that define it as xe cfashion xe the variety of materials colors shapes and styles creates skirts pants shirts dresses sweaters and other items that appeal to range of tastes
take sweater it can have puritan collar shirt collar ribbed collar xef xbc the list goes on to train machine to understand sweater you need to install data set of images of all kinds of sweaters tagged with their design attributes the ai network or single machine trained to have predictive ability would then recognize specific type of sweater the next time it sees one
the data set is most important it serves as guideline for the machine xe learning process and sets the foundation for all follow up research
xe cit needs to be professional enough to meet the requirements of machine training xe wong said including complete and precise attributes for each style that may be applied to the basic image
xe cfor sweater with turtleneck you need to give it tag both as sweater and turtleneck if it xe identified sometimes as sweater and sometimes as turtleneck the machine will be confused xe
wong said the accuracy of searches for clothing images on the internet is only about percent something he attributes to the lack of sufficient professional data
the ai system adopted by alibaba has been trained to recognize more than outfits
the second level of ai application in fashion is to analyze current styles evaluate their most popular elements provide recommendations and even predict trends
wong said that if machine has data set of the latest images of outfits in the fashion world it could calculate which elements are emerging as popular and may become the trend of the foreseeable future then it could offer recommendations for consumers based on predictive analysis and individual preferences
the team expects that in the near future ai will be able to collect more data from customers providing important information about the popularity of certain styles the data can note the amount of time customer spends looking at particular piece of clothing using xe csmart mirror xe and whether they decide to buy it along with other aspects of the fashion experience
alibaba will combine data from taobao with that collected in offline shops aiming to provide an all around data service for the industry xef xbc from fashion design and material selection to storage and logistics
ai appears set to transform the fashion industry but is there anything machine is not likely to master in the near future
yes said wong because in the end designers are irreplaceable the core of design is the inspiration he said and machine can only serve as an assistant at best

dearborn mich xe when jim hackett took over as chief executive of ford motor he was charged with revitalizing company suffering from slumping profits rising costs and an uncertain outlook
in the months since then mr hackett has shuffled ford xe executive ranks and outlined plans to introduce new sport utility vehicles and electric cars other steps in his strategy however have been slow in coming
new models xe including updated escape and explorer xe are on the way but most won xe begin arriving until the second half of the company xe stock price is still lagging and while mr hackett has vowed to cut engineering costs and improve ford xe xe cfitness xe he has yet to specify how he xe ll do that what his overall turnaround plan entails and what financial targets ford hopes to hit
the lack of detail has frustrated wall street analysts and the tension spilled into the open during conference call in january in the call mr hackett noted that ford was working on six efficiency initiatives but offered no specifics
xe cwhen are we going to know these six xe adam jonas of morgan stanley asked xe cbecause asked you pretty straightforward question you xe re alluding to the six in your slides you xe re clearly not willing to talk about them xe then with tone of exasperation rarely heard in such calls mr jonas added xe cthat xe problem jim xe
the slow rollout of recovery plan has added new layer to the challenges facing the no american automaker it has trouble on several fronts operations in europe india and south america are struggling costs for key materials like aluminum and steel are rising sales in china have stalled and its model line is short on the new types of and trucks that buyers are snapping up in the united states
in recent note to his clients mr jonas said investors were becoming skittish about ford and saw general motors and fiat chrysler as better bets largely because of the uncertainty of how mr hackett intends to fix the company xe cford is seen as carrying unnecessarily high levels of risk and little transparency xe he wrote
ford is due to report its first quarter earnings on wednesday and is expected to offer some new information about cost cutting but investors probably won xe see full blown turnaround plan until september three people familiar with the matter said
senior executives are debating the elements of comprehensive plan to streamline ford xe internal operations and rebuild profitability in the company xe north american business and job cuts cannot be ruled out these people said they said key goal would be lifting north america xe profit margin to near percent by or last year ford north america xe margin was percent well short of the percent that general motors achieved
shrinking or selling unprofitable foreign operations could also be part of the new strategy the three people said and the company is also discussing whether to continue selling small and midsize cars in the domestic market ford currently loses money on the fiesta focus and the fusion sedan they said
ford xe top executives expect to present the plan to the company xe directors at the board xe july meeting these people said the july gathering is typically when directors spend several days at ford to give its business strategy thorough review and test drive new models the company is preparing to introduce
ford spokesman bradley carroll declined to comment on the board xe deliberations but he added that xe cthe entire company is intensely focused on improving the operational fitness of the business to deliver profitable growth with improved returns xe
mr hackett has signaled that he is wary of rushing into new strategy xe cif you think too quickly and you xe re wrong xe he told reporters in march xe cyou get this joy of making it to market but then you xe re always correcting xe
just two years ago ford was cruising at high speed mr hackett xe predecessor mark fields guided the company to record earnings in xe nearly billion in pretax profit brimming with confidence mr fields approved several ambitious projects he set off hiring spree to stock up on software developers engineers and other executives xe talent that he believed ford would need to compete as electric and self driving cars reshape the auto industry
ford laid out billion dollar plan to remake its dearborn mich locations into high tech silicon valley like campus the company invested in ride sharing and other start ups in bid to turn itself into xe cmobility xe company mr fields and ford xe chairman william ford jr called on director xe mr hackett xe to join the management ranks and run the mobility activities it also introduced super sports car the ford gt
but when mr fields couldn xe move fast enough to head off slippage in ford xe profits the board dismissed him last may and handed the reins to mr hackett former chief executive of steelcase who is credited with turning around the office furniture maker and analysts question whether the vestiges of the fields strategy will ever pay off
its very name was synonymous with the th century economy now it xe trying to catch up with silicon valley on self driving cars
the headquarters makeover might make ford more enticing place to work years down the road but won xe generate the revenue growth the company needs now the mobility businesses aren xe making money yet and while the gt sports car turns heads ford is selling only year xe cyou have to ask the question is it really getting you showroom traffic xe said brian johnson of barclays capital
ford xe aluminum bodied pickup truck introduced in late has been strong seller and big generator of profits but other parts of its core business have been sputtering as american consumers gravitated away from cars and toward trucks and roomy but fuel efficient cousins known as crossovers ford began losing money on cars and allowed its and crossover lineup to age the current explorer was introduced in and the escape in competing models from toyota honda and others have since been redesigned and feature newer technology
xe cwhat they should have done is invest in the new crossovers in and xe said david whiston an analyst at morningstar crossovers he noted now make up third of the american car market
ford also decided to drop its small pickup the ranger but it is now scrambling to introduce redesigned version of the ranger after realizing it was losing sales of small pickups to competitors
mr hackett and his executive team have presented overviews of his vision for ford on wall street and elsewhere on several occasions at an event in march they promised to introduce slew of new including high performance and off road models but his presentations haven xe generated much enthusiasm with investors ford xe stock is trading at about slightly below where it stood year ago
mr whiston said he was willing to wait for mr hackett to present comprehensive plan but he added xe cit is strange that it xe been almost year and we don xe have any concrete details xe

half moon bay calif xe alexa is multiplying and that xe exactly what amazon wants
the smart speaker assistant which debuted four years ago with the tech company xe echo device has gone from handy gadget for streaming music to ubiquitous home tool able to do everything from switching on the lights to ordering an uber
amazon announced recently that it had sold more than million alexa devices and the company is all in last fall it unveiled more than dozen assorted devices that tap into the voice assistant including microwave and wall clock
dave limp amazon xe senior vice president for devices and services said alexa was xe cat scale xe and had gained the most traction by making parts of daily life more convenient
xe cwe started with the home we xe re now adding the car xe mr limp said at the new york times xe new work summit last week
he said that people find tasks that become habitual to them xe often very different things
xe cat least once week often every day get an email from somebody who just says that the echo has changed their lives xe mr limp said xe cthey might not have all their mobility they might be little elderly and they find companionship with alexa they find the ability to interact in way they couldn xe before xe
mr limp said that alexa might feel somewhat human to some because of the xe cempathy xe put into it
xe cif you xe re an adult and you say you xe re depressed or suicidal xe he said xe cor you xe re potentially victim of domestic abuse and you xe re talking to alexa in that way we xe ve talked to experts about what we should do in those situations alexa would try to connect you to suicide hotline or domestic abuse hotlines xe
he said alexa xe personality would continue to grow with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning
xe cdo we need to make her more conversational and less transactional over time yes xe he said xe cwe have thousands of people working on that right now the goal would be that an assistant of your choice would have exactly the kind of conversation that we xe re having right now xe
but do people want their conversations recorded and saved in the cloud mr limp said xe cutterances xe were encrypted when stored much as credit card data is he said users could erase recordings if they wished
xe cif you messed up and said something you didn xe want amazon to have or anybody else in amazon to see you can delete those individual utterances or you can delete every utterance xe he said xe cit xe very important to realize the reason we keep the data is to make the system better xe
last year amazon echo accounted for percent of installed smart speakers in the united states while google home made up percent and apple homepod percent according to recent survey by consumer intelligence research partners the analysis showed sharp increase in the number of people with more than one smart speaker device up to percent last year from percent in
michael levin partner and co founder of consumer intelligence research partners attributed the increased adoption of smart speakers to less expensive devices introduced by amazon and google xe cit also encouraged users to buy more than one xe he said
mr levin said his company xe research indicated that while more consumers were buying multiple devices they were staying true to just one operating system xe conce an owner starts using one or another smart home system and learns how to use it and accessorizes it it xe awfully hard to switch xe he said xe cthis of course leaves apple and other latecomers behind xe
that xe not to say that people are replacing their smartphones with their smart speakers
xe cwe see these increasingly as the center of smart home or business the stationary analog to mobile technology xe mr levin said
micah collins the director of product management for google home agreed that ambient devices like smart speakers and smart displays were complementary to personal devices like smartphones xe cusers will interact with information and services through an ever increasing number of devices during the natural course of their daily lives xe mr collins said

the fatal accident involving an autonomous vehicle operated by the ride hailing service uber has prompted one automaker to temporarily halt its testing of self driving cars on public roads
the accident on sunday night in tempe ariz prompted uber to halt its tests on the streets of four cities tempe pittsburgh san francisco and toronto on tuesday toyota motor said that it too was suspending its tests of autonomous vehicles on public roads near its research center in ann arbor mich and in the san francisco area
toyota has fleet of test vehicles that can drive themselves although engineers and safety drivers ride along to take control if necessary xe the same arrangement that was used in the uber vehicle that fatally struck pedestrian in tempe
xe cwe xe ve told our drivers to take couple of days off so we can assess the situation xe said rick bourgoise toyota spokesman
the company is continuing to test autonomous vehicles at three enclosed proving grounds xe two in ann arbor that are affiliated with the university of michigan and another known as gomentum station former naval weapons station in concord calif
two other carmakers ford motor and general motors are still performing tests of their self driving cars on public roads waymo the autonomous vehicle division of google xe parent company alphabet and lyft uber xe chief rival in the ride hailing sector declined to comment on the status of their testing programs on tuesday
those companies are racing to put autonomous vehicles into commercial ride and delivery fleets within few years aims to start ride hailing service by the end of using car it has developed called the cruise av that has no steering wheel or pedals ford hopes to have similar vehicle in mass production by
after the tempe accident said tuesday xe cour plans to commercially launch in dense urban environments in remain unchanged but as we xe ve said from the start we will not launch until we are satisfied that it is safe to do so xe
the death of woman who was struck by an autonomous car operated by uber is believed to be the first pedestrian fatality associated with self driving technology newly released video offers clues about what happened
the accident in tempe involved volvo xc sport utility vehicle that uber had outfitted with radar cameras and other sensors and computer gear that enable it to navigate without input from driver although safety driver was in the vehicle at the time it was in autonomous mode when it struck and killed elaine herzberg on sunday night
ms herzberg was walking with her bicycle when she was hit the volvo was traveling at about miles per hour the car did not appear to slow before the impact according to the tempe police
it is believed to be first pedestrian death associated with self driving car
the tempe police said tuesday that the investigation by the national transportation safety board was still underway including the gathering of electronic data from the car and video from camera that was mounted on its dashboard the police reiterated that it had not yet been determined whether any party was at fault
over the past year number of companies have built up fleets of autonomous vehicles and begun testing them on public roads xe many of them in arizona where officials have welcomed self driving cars one start up has taken to large retirement community xe which is private property xe to test while some companies have also turned to virtual reality testing to teach their vehicles how to behave
at the same time some universities and state and local governments have been working to create realistic proving grounds where companies can work on self driving cars without interacting with the public
xe cobviously this is real tragedy and it will take time to know what happened xe said carrie morton deputy director of mcity acre center operated in ann arbor by the university of michigan it features simulated city streets and intersections with traffic lights road signs parking meters railroad crossing and tunnel more than companies have become partners in the project
xe cwe firmly believe combination of on road testing enclosed facilities like mcity and computer simulation will be required to develop autonomous technology xe ms morton said
the university of michigan is also helping to develop larger site about miles away in ypsilanti where the american center of mobility covers acres at world war ii era bomber plant it includes highway ramps overpasses and bridges that allow automakers to test self driving cars at high speeds and in more complex environments than at mcity
mcity and the american center for mobility are near technical centers operated by several companies including ford toyota fiat chrysler hyundai and waymo
gomentum stations is the largest such center covering acres it has about miles of paved roads and cluster of barracks and buildings that provide an urban environment

in craig nevill manning computer scientist at google wanted to set up an engineering outpost in new york google xe top leaders were skeptical but they told him that he could go ahead if he could find xe cgoogle worthy xe software developers in the city
xe cthe attitude was that pretty much all the good software engineers were in silicon valley xe mr nevill manning recalled xe cit seems crazy in retrospect xe
mr nevill manning found his developers and opened the engineering office in new york today google employs people in the city and more than half are engineers and technical staff
the google story mirrors the rise and evolution of new york as genuine tech hub xe home to deep pool of technical talent as well as sales marketing and business expertise and amazon xe decision to put headquarters in the city eventually employing more than workers only reinforces that trend
do you live or work near amazon xe proposed new headquarters in queens or arlington va we want to hear from you
xe cthis solidifies new york xe importance and significance in tech xe said fred wilson the dean of new york xe venture capital community and co founder of union square ventures
amazon like most big tech companies is no stranger to new york it already has over workers in new york from commerce marketers to cloud computing engineers
facebook has over new york employees including yann lecun its chief artificial intelligence scientist and pioneer in the field salesforce employs more than at its new offices in new york and tech stalwart ibm chose the city as the headquarters for its watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions
most technology work in new york has traditionally been in service of other industries that market too is growing briskly as banks retailers advertising and consulting firms xe major employers in new york xe are all getting digital makeovers and hiring goldman sachs for example employs tech workers in new york including data analysts app developers digital security and blockchain experts manuela veloso head of the machine learning department at carnegie mellon university joined jpmorgan chase this year to lead its research team
the five companies with the most tech related job listings in new york over the last three months on indeed com the jobs listing site are amazon bny mellon capgemini jpmorgan chase and morgan stanley
measurements of tech sector jobs vary depending on definitions but the broad picture is growing labor market for well paying jobs from to according to government statistics tech sector employment grew by in the city or percent to an estimated and the average salary of in the most recent estimate available was far higher than the citywide average of for all private employers

the bay area to be sure remains the nation xe high tech epicenter new york is growing impressively but its tech work force according to most analyses is less than half and perhaps one third that of the bay area
new york fairly consistently ranks second behind the bay area in attracting venture capital in the third quarter for example investors put billion in start ups in the new york metropolitan area according to figures compiled by the pwc cb insights moneytree report
but the bay area including san francisco and silicon valley took in billion start ups in the washington region where amazon plans to put another large headquarters received million in the third quarter
in the past new york start ups typically sold out to larger tech companies that too is changing mr wilson the venture capitalist pointed to mongodb database supplier and etsy an commerce seller as examples of start ups that held out and went public in recent years
mongodb trades at about share compared with its initial price of share when it went public in october etsy which went public at share in currently trades at about share
xe cnew york entrepreneurs investors and boards are just starting to get the courage to stay independent and grow here xe mr wilson said
the rise of new york xe tech sector businesspeople and technologists agree owes debt to former mayor michael bloomberg he pushed initiatives to make the new york economy less dependent on finance and championed tech programs and education xe long term campaign to upgrade the technical skills of the city xe work force whose progress enhanced new york xe appeal to amazon
after the financial crisis hit in mr bloomberg stepped up those efforts in his administration announced an applied sciences competition
the city solicited proposals from universities and research organizations for new center of higher education that would focus on technology innovation and business the winner announced in december was joint plan by cornell university and the technion israel institute of technology
the new institution cornell tech got underway in manhattan in and last year moved into three buildings in its first phase of development on roosevelt island there are now graduate students on campus over the next two decades the plan calls for two million square feet of buildings student population of and hundreds of faculty daniel huttenlocher the dean of cornell tech sits on amazon xe board
the prospect of new competition served as prod xe and encouragement xe to both columbia university and new york university columbia expanded its engineering and computer science programs and created the data science institute absorbed an engineering school polytechnic university which in became xe tandon school of engineering
also took over an old unused metropolitan transportation authority building in brooklyn renovated it and has begun populating it with tech fueled research ventures starting with the center for urban science and progress
for technologists who have recently come to new york part of its appeal is the same thing that explains why its tech sector is often overlooked new york xe huge and diverse economy and its culture
xe ceverything is tech driven on the west coast xe said jeannette wing who left microsoft research last year to become the director of columbia xe data science institute xe cbut the east coast is more well rounded it is about technology but not just technology for its own sake xe

cars need to get faster xe not on the road but on the inside
speed has always been part of the mystique of the automotive business but cars have been notoriously slow when it comes to handling information it is problem that has only become more pressing as the era of autonomous vehicles looms with competing interests racing to be the first with solution
cars have long relied on relatively simple network standard called the can or controller area network bus the can bus coordinates all the microprocessors and electronic control units or that need to trade engine powertrain and diagnostic information transmitting details like transmission status and fluid levels as more electronics like window and seat controls were added to cars the can bus was tweaked over the years with additional local interconnection networks or lins to handle the swelling communications load
but the can bus which was originally developed by bosch more than years ago is showing its age
new advanced driver assistance systems like automatic emergency braking electronic stability control and lane keeping assistance demand instant communications so automakers have been supplementing their networks adding megabit per second mbps ethernet cabling for example to the rat xe nest of wiring inside vehicles
xe cbut when every new feature gets added you add new and new layer of wiring xe said jack weast the chief systems architect for autonomous driving solutions at intel that approach is inefficient expensive heavy xe and still slow xe cso from connectivity point of view there xe need to re architect the vehicle from the inside out xe mr weast said
underscoring the urgency for new high speed network in cars is the coming wave of autonomous driving systems
test drive through congested manhattan streets with austin russell chief executive of the lidar company luminar demonstrated just how much more data is going to be generated inside self driving vehicles prowling the upper west side car fitted with luminar xe lidar system which uses near infrared light to detect objects around it created high resolution scans of thousands of data points times second painting picture of cyclists pedestrians street vendors and even dogs up to feet ahead
xe cyou have to have ridiculous superhuman sensors to make up for the fact that computers aren xe nearly as smart as humans xe and won xe be for very very long time xe said mr russell as the car xe sensor swept the crowded blocks ahead on central park west
that means more sensors xe and more data experimental designs for autonomous cars incorporate as many as video cameras radar sensors half dozen ultrasonic sensors and four or five lidar sensors and still more sensors and scanners might be necessary to make self driving cars impervious to exigencies like blinding blizzards and soaking downpours
xe cwe have seen an explosion in data bandwidth xe said lee bauer vice president at aptiv supplier of autonomous and driver assistance systems mr bauer cited what has become mantra among autonomous vehicle engineers self driving cars will generate terabytes of data per hour that includes live information about road conditions weather objects around them traffic and street signs xe all of which has to be shared among components in the car and used to make split second driving decisions
automakers are aware of the coming data tsunami
xe cthey think we need teraflops of computing power xe said willard tu senior director at chip supplier xilinx teraflop is trillion operations per second which means that every vehicle would be rolling supercomputer xe cso the type of pipe and the diameter of that pipe xe that is going to connect all these components mr tu said xe chas to be very flexible xe estimates for how big that pipe needs to be range from to or more gigabytes per second
the catch xe cno one xe solved the problem of how do stream all that data to the central processor xe said mr tu
while engineers and automakers agree that today xe cars need to be completely rewired the question for many is with what
eliminating the cables entirely by using short distance wireless system would be the easiest way to bridge the gap however wireless systems are susceptible to radio frequency interference which could affect reliability and endanger lives and wireless systems are more vulnerable to security threats said mr weast of intel
optical fiber offers some of the highest speeds and lightweight cabling but fiber is expensive and fragile humidity vibration and dust in its connectors can all lead to signal loss said amir bar niv spokesman for semiconductor firm aquantia some luxury brands have tried optical fiber with mixed results xe cso automakers have said they are not going to have fiber in the car xe he said
by far the most popular candidate for car xe internal network wiring is still copper although copper faces some challenges transmitting high speed data over long distances the lengths required in most cars are relatively short and automakers have decades of experience working with it
perhaps more important than the physical cabling is the type of network protocol cars should use to speed up the flow of information the most common local area network protocol is ethernet the same format that has been business and home networking standard for decades but most current ethernet networks typically have top speed of gigabit per second gbps xe not fast enough to handle the torrent of data that an autonomous vehicle would produce
to help speed things up xe and encourage the use of ethernet xe several companies recently formed the networking for autonomous vehicles alliance the nav alliance includes leading parts and systems suppliers like bosch and continental as well as the chip makers nvidia and aquantia xe and the world xe largest automaker volkswagen the goal is to get the industry to coalesce around faster multi gig automotive ethernet network standard with initial proposed speeds of gbps and eventually gbps
there are other contenders to rewire the automotive industry however such as hdbaset initially developed to handle high resolution video and audio hdbaset can also transmit power and ethernet based communications xe up to gbps xe over unshielded copper cables developed by valens hdbaset has garnered support from major consumer electronics companies including lg electronics sony and samsung electronics which has also been investing heavily in autonomous car technology hdbaset xe supporters also believe updated versions will quickly reach speeds of gbps and gbps
there xe potential windfall for whoever wins the race to bring high speed networks to cars which will create market for millions of new connecting chips gateways and controllers to support the new standard it xe what companies like aquantia valens and xilinx are hoping for
flexibility may ultimately be the deciding factor the old can and lin networks aren xe likely to be abandoned soon said bobby hambrick chief executive of autonomoustuff
xe cthe can bus will be used for really basic stuff and lin will control the horn or blinkers because the chips for those are really cheap xe said mr hambrick whose company builds autonomous car platforms including the open source apollo platform from the chinese firm baidu any new high speed ethernet or hdbaset network he said will have to be backward compatible with those systems
furthermore the components and sensors needed for self driving cars and trucks xe and how all that information should be managed and interpreted xe is far from set in stone most companies haven xe committed to particular types of cameras or lidar sensors for their future autonomous cars so any new network will have to accommodate variety of components
xe ci go to two carmakers and get three different opinions xe about what kind of system they want mr bar niv said xe cbut they all want high speed network xe

davos switzerland xe they xe ll never admit it in public but many of your bosses want machines to replace you as soon as possible
know this because for the past week xe ve been mingling with corporate executives at the world economic forum xe annual meeting in davos and xe ve noticed that their answers to questions about automation depend very much on who is listening
in public many executives wring their hands over the negative consequences that artificial intelligence and automation could have for workers they take part in panel discussions about building xe chuman centered xe for the xe cfourth industrial revolution xe xe davos speak for the corporate adoption of machine learning and other advanced technology xe and talk about the need to provide safety net for people who lose their jobs as result of automation
but in private settings including meetings with the leaders of the many consulting and technology firms whose pop up storefronts line the davos promenade these executives tell different story they are racing to automate their own work forces to stay ahead of the competition with little regard for the impact on workers
all over the world executives are spending billions of dollars to transform their businesses into lean digitized highly automated operations they crave the fat profit margins automation can deliver and they see as golden ticket to savings perhaps by letting them whittle departments with thousands of workers down to just few dozen
xe cpeople are looking to achieve very big numbers xe said mohit joshi the president of infosys technology and consulting firm that helps other businesses automate their operations xe cearlier they had incremental to percent goals in reducing their work force now they xe re saying xe why can xe we do it with percent of the people we have xe xe
few american executives will admit wanting to get rid of human workers taboo in today xe age of inequality so they xe ve come up with long list of buzzwords and euphemisms to disguise their intent workers aren xe being replaced by machines they xe re being xe creleased xe from onerous repetitive tasks companies aren xe laying off workers they xe re xe cundergoing digital transformation xe
survey by deloitte found that percent of companies had already started to use machines to perform tasks previously done by humans the figure is expected to climb to percent by next year
the corporate elite xe obsession has been lucrative for firms that specialize in xe crobotic process automation xe or infosys which is based in india reported percent increase in year over year revenue in its digital division ibm xe xe ccognitive solutions xe unit which uses to help businesses increase efficiency has become the company xe second largest division posting billion in revenue last quarter the investment bank ubs projects that the artificial intelligence industry could be worth as much as billion by next yea
kai fu lee the author of xe cai superpowers xe and longtime technology executive predicts that artificial intelligence will eliminate percent of the world xe jobs within years in an interview he said that chief executives were under enormous pressure from shareholders and boards to maximize short term profits and that the rapid shift toward automation was the inevitable result
xe cthey always say it xe more than the stock price xe he said xe cbut in the end if you screw up you get fired xe
other experts have predicted that will create more new jobs than it destroys and that job losses caused by automation will probably not be catastrophic they point out that some automation helps workers by improving productivity and freeing them to focus on creative tasks over routine ones
but at time of political unrest and anti elite movements on the progressive left and the nationalist right it xe probably not surprising that all of this automation is happening quietly out of public view in davos this week several executives declined to say how much money they had saved by automating jobs previously done by humans and none were willing to say publicly that replacing human workers is their ultimate goal
xe cthat xe the great dichotomy xe said ben pring the director of the center for the future of work at cognizant technology services firm xe con one hand xe he said profit minded executives xe cabsolutely want to automate as much as they can xe
xe con the other hand xe he added xe cthey xe re facing backlash in civic society xe
for an unvarnished view of how some american leaders talk about automation in private you have to listen to their counterparts in asia who often make no attempt to hide their aims terry gou the chairman of the taiwanese electronics manufacturer foxconn has said the company plans to replace percent of its workers with robots in the next five to years richard liu the founder of the chinese commerce company jd com said at business conference last year that xe ci hope my company would be percent automation someday xe
one common argument made by executives is that workers whose jobs are eliminated by automation can be xe creskilled xe to perform other jobs in an organization they offer examples like accenture which claimed in to have replaced back office processing jobs without layoffs by training employees to work elsewhere in the company in letter to shareholders last year jeff bezos amazon xe chief executive said that more than amazon warehouse workers had received training in high demand fields like nursing and aircraft mechanics with the company covering percent of their expenses
but these programs may be the exception that proves the rule there are plenty of stories of successful reskilling xe optimists often cite program in kentucky that trained small group of former coal miners to become computer programmers xe but there is little evidence that it works at scale report by the world economic forum this month estimated that of the million workers who are projected to be fully displaced by automation in the next decade only one in four can be profitably reskilled by private sector programs the rest presumably will need to fend for themselves or rely on government assistance
in davos executives tend to speak about automation as natural phenomenon over which they have no control like hurricanes or heat waves they claim that if they don xe automate jobs as quickly as possible their competitors will
xe cthey will be disrupted if they don xe xe said katy george senior partner at the consulting firm mckinsey amp company
automating work is choice of course one made harder by the demands of shareholders but it is still choice and even if some degree of unemployment caused by automation is inevitable these executives can choose how the gains from automation and are distributed and whether to give the excess profits they reap as result to workers or hoard it for themselves and their shareholders
the choices made by the davos elite xe and the pressure applied on them to act in workers xe interests rather than their own xe will determine whether is used as tool for increasing productivity or for inflicting pain
xe cthe choice isn xe between automation and non automation xe said erik brynjolfsson the director of xe initiative on the digital economy xe cit xe between whether you use the technology in way that creates shared prosperity or more concentration of wealth xe

nine days ago we learned that cambridge analytica the firm engaged by the trump campaign to lead its digital strategy leading up to the united states presidential elections illegitimately gained access to the facebook data of more than million users many of them american voters this revelation came on the heels of the announcement made last month by the justice department special counsel robert mueller of the indictment of russians who worked for the internet research agency xe ctroll farm xe tied to the kremlin charging that they wielded fake social media accounts to influence the presidential elections
but as facebook google twitter and like companies now contritely cover their tracks and comply with the government xe requests they simultaneously remain quiet about critical trend that promises to subvert the nation xe political integrity yet again if left unaddressed the systemic integration of artificial intelligence into the same digital marketing technologies that were exploited by both cambridge analytica and the internet research agency
according to the xe findings the tactics used to date by russia have technologically speaking not been particularly sophisticated those tactics have included the direct control of fake social media accounts and manual drafting of subversive messages these were often timed for release with politically charged incidents in the real world xe including for instance the suicide bombings in brussels the declaration of donald trump as the republican nominee and mr trump xe staging of town hall in new hampshire each of which occurred weeks before election night in further according to various experts cambridge analytica xe targeting efforts likely were tame and ineffective
each step of the digital campaigns seems to have been orchestrated by human working from computer terminal to be sure we know that the internet research agency xe deception campaigns altogether enjoyed broad reach and were viewed by many americans more than million of us may have unwittingly viewed the russians xe egregious and misleading content on facebook alone and if cambridge analytica did indeed make use of the rich trove of sensitive data it acquired from aleksandr kogan xe firm global science research cambridge analytica xe content too likely reached tens of millions of american voters but because their digital messaging was largely controlled directly by bottleneck of human propagators its spread necessarily was relatively uncoordinated and ad hoc
as the industry increasingly integrates artificial intelligence into digital advertising however disinformation operations and legitimate political communications will gradually become concerted automatic and seamless the real innovation in digital marketing xe and the type of thing that the united states congress and american voters should be particularly concerned about xe is the execution of disinformation that operates at real scale where there were once couple dozen human operators stitching together few divisive messages during working hours in moscow to pick at the digital halls of our democracy there will soon be countless systems testing and probing plethora of content on vast field of social media user audiences that are highly segmented by race ethnicity gender location socioeconomic class and political leaning we can expect advisory firms like cambridge analytica the russians and other participants xe not to mention our own political parties themselves xe to pounce on this new vector for political messaging and take direct aim at our open political discourse
despite these myriad risks industry professionals seem to have turned blind eye to the oncoming specter of likely because they are optimistic about its commercial potential the leading internet firms are offering free courses for their brightest engineers are developing plans to integrate across their leading brands and products and are staffing up with brilliant philosophers ethicists and technocrats to deflect nosy regulators and win over the merchants of information in his interview with the new york times last week mark zuckerberg even went so far as to describe as the antidote that will cure the internet of such negative externalities as hate speech and election interference what internet firms are not transparent about though is the degree to which they plan to integrate into their principal profit generating engine digital advertising
consider the scale and complexity of the advertising ecosystem global internet firms like facebook twitter snapchat and google collectively enjoy billions of active users who on average spend more than two hours on these platforms every day each user might be shown hundreds or thousands of digital display ads xe or xe csponsored xe content xe within that time people in the industry leverage an intricate web of ad agencies exchanges networks demand side platforms and supply side platforms to manage the delivery of those ads around the clock
but if you could remove those people from the equation you could quietly turn billion digital ad industry into trillion persuasion machine
to be clear algorithms have long been part and parcel of the industry organizations like the russian government and cambridge analytica were taking advantage of them simply by virtue of using social media for political communications but the sharp uptick in industry research and development in over the past year strongly suggests that this new technology will soon be brought to bear in digital advertising this will increase the speed of ad mediation inundating users with content finely tuned to their personal desires it will abet the seamless and accurate development of xe clook alike xe audiences enabling advertisers to upload their customer lists and automatically send ads to like minded people that they do not already know and it will enable automated contingency based marketing allowing clients to programmatically trigger certain kinds of content to be shared in the moments after real world events transpire
for students of disinformation xe including the russians who to date have not even had to leverage such sophisticated web technology to mislead american voters xe this new information ecosystem presents vast land of opportunity one could imagine that the internet research agency could set up automated machine learning informed content targeting systems so that minutes after north korea xe leader references hypothetical icbm the russians send inflammatory produced messages and imagery to classes of the american population that has predicted will be susceptible to disinformation the scalability of such activity is what makes such tactics especially fearsome
deep rooted societal tensions will likely be exacerbated by the irresponsible integration of into digital advertising services xe not to mention into the ranking and curation of xe corganic xe content on social media news feeds and search results we xe re already seeing this for example just few hours before senator marco rubio took the stage to speak with students from marjory stoneman douglas high school ill taught algorithms were responsible for the spread of youtube videos that mocked and shamed the students
even in light of the cambridge analytica revelations there is time yet to act internet firms should aggressively work to limit disinformation on their platforms by developing algorithms xe perhaps driven by as suggested by mr zuckerberg xe that can detect disinformation and flag it for fast human review strong one off actions against widespread disinformation tactics such as twitter xe recent move can also help they also must be more transparent about their algorithmic software and data practices with researchers journalists and consumers further the regulatory community must continue its aggressive review of the industry xe practices the federal trade commission xe announcement of its forthcoming investigation into facebook xe privacy practices represents excellent progress
in the meantime the public must not let up the economic structure of the digital sector has already harmed our society in ways that have been exacerbated by the unchecked collection of individual behavioral data the revelations about cambridge analytica and russia xe disinformation operations are prime evidence for this xe and things could get worse very soon politicians and regulators must continue the call for meaningful privacy law and stronger antitrust enforcement in this country nothing less can win us back full control of the state

san francisco xe match between an israeli college debate champion and loquacious ibm computer program demonstrated on monday new gains in the quest for computers that can hold conversations with humans it also led to an unlikely question for the tech industry xe deep thinkers can machine talk too much
at an ibm office in downtown san francisco noa ovadia college senior who won an israeli championship in squared off with ibm xe program called the ibm debater
she argued against government subsidies for space exploration the machine argued in favor delivering three brief speeches in digitally created monotone and xe at least in small ways xe responding to ms ovadia xe human opinions
xe canother point that believe my opponent made is that there are more important things than space exploration to spend money on xe the machine said during its lengthy rebuttal xe cit is very easy to say there are more important things to spend money on and do not dispute this no one is claiming that this is the only item on our expense list xe
under development for six years this artificial intelligence system is part of broader effort to build technology that can interact with people the way we interact with one another
last month google demonstrated system called google duplex that can phone restaurant and make dinner reservations in china you can phone xiaoice xe cchatbot xe built by microsoft and spend few minutes shooting the breeze
companies like google amazon and apple have for several years offered coffee table gadgets and smartphone apps that answer simple questions or perform simple tasks xe chey siri set my alarm for tomorrow xe
projects like ibm debater and google duplex show that this kind of system is starting to stretch beyond simple commands but they also demonstrate the limitations of current technology
ibm xe system was designed to debate about topics but these interactions are tightly constrained four minute opening statement followed by rebuttal to its opponent xe argument xe and then statement summing up its own viewpoint it was not exactly lincoln douglas
subsidized space exploration the machine said during its opening statement xe cinspires our children to pursue education and careers in science and technology and mathematics xe
xe cit is more important than good roads or improved schools or better health care xe it added
noam slonim an ibm researcher who helped oversee the project estimated that the technology could have xe cmeaningful xe debate on those topics percent of the time ibm chose the topic for the live debate before it began in some cases the machine xe lengthy speeches hinted at how it was stitching together its arguments xe identifying relevant sentences and clauses and then combining them into reasonably coherent computerized thought
google duplex is also limited to narrow tasks it can xe cschedule hair salon appointments xe or xe cget holiday hours xe as well as book restaurant reservations and because google has revealed the system only in brief demonstrations it is unclear how well it really performs certainly systems like xiaoice are long way from passing the turing test the challenge laid down by the british computing pioneer alan turing in the that asks whether machine can play xe cthe imitation game xe to mimic humans no one would mistake these systems for human xe at least not after lengthy conversation
in ibm demonstrated system that could beat the leading players at the trivia game show xe cjeopardy xe the company used this system called watson as way of promoting wide range of products and consulting services for hospitals and other businesses
after watson won mr slonim researcher at an ibm lab in haifa israel pitched the debater project as ibm xe next xe cgrand challenge xe
the long running project is in some ways an unorthodox addition to the rapidly accelerating field of artificial intelligence research among big tech companies and major labs no one else is exploring technology that can carry on debate as two humans would say discuss politics and mr slonim acknowledged that ibm debater was not direct path to new product or service xe cdebating is not business xe he said
but the project reflects the recent acceleration of research related to xe cnatural language understanding xe the effort to build machines that can understand the natural way we humans talk and respond in kind as this research progresses it can provide new ways for computers to digest and process information or even lead to machines that can hold completely convincing conversation
this sort of technology would have wide range of uses it could help businesses filter hot button issues on social media or it could provide governments with more effective way of censoring information
understanding natural language is such complex and difficult task systems like ibm debater lean on wide range of systems each handling different part of the problem one system will identify information that helps fuel an argument on one side of the debate another will generate the text of the argument and so on
typically each system is designed and built independently before researchers meld them together but recent research from the likes of openai an independent artificial intelligence lab in san francisco and salesforce the san francisco tech giant point toward the development of systems that can tackle language problems in broader way teach system to do one task and it can help with other tasks too
in recent years researchers have significantly improved systems that recognize people and objects identify spoken words and translate between languages
but understanding language is far more complex that means systems that perform fairly simple language tasks xe like writing wikipedia article let alone engaging in serious debate on random topic xe may still be years away
xe cit is now very obvious this change is happening xe said jeremy howard an independent researcher working in this area xe cbut these things take time xe
an earlier version of this article misquoted the ibm debater computer program that participated in debate with an israeli college senior on june during an exchange the program said xe cit is very easy to say there are more important things to spend money on and do not dispute this xe not xe ci dispute this xe

dr kirchhoff helped lead pentagon group that integrates technology from startups into military missions
should technologists prevent their tools from being used to wage war
this question was answered with furious yes at google recently when more than employees signed memo protesting the use of the company xe algorithms in project maven defense department effort to automatically identify objects in video citing the company motto xe cdon xe be evil xe the employees asked their chief executive sundar pichai to stay out of xe cthe business of war xe
other critics of silicon valley pentagon partnerships have made different argument not that collaboration risks compromising silicon valley values but that contact with the military xe inefficient processes would contaminate the fast moving culture of silicon valley
both arguments misunderstand the nature of technology and the military xe role in accelerating the commercial ascendancy of the united states closer relationship between silicon valley and the pentagon is good for industry and for national security xe as well as for the debate we as american citizens must have about how technology is used especially in war
google xe engineers should be applauded for raising questions about how the machine learning algorithms they invented are employed in project maven their aspiration that google never xe cbuild warfare technology xe or xe coutsource the moral responsibility xe for using technology is noble goal it would be morally convenient if technology for war could be cleaved so cleanly from technology for everything else but it can xe be
silicon valley is already at war in the sense that the broad classes of technology it invents for search storage and pattern recognition have inherent military uses the same machine learning algorithms developed to categorize images on the internet can be used to identity terrorist activity technology circulates between government and industry between times of peace and war in ways no corporate policy can turn on or off
engineers in silicon valley are learning what students of history have long known technology often springs forth in unforeseen ways wreaking havoc in some cases and providing salvation in others those who uncork the proverbial genie cannot control its future by decree
but all hope for accountability is not lost the controversy over project maven is teaching us an important civics lesson about who governs technology google exists in democracy whose elected representatives ultimately decide whether to use force and through what means the best way to influence how the united states fights wars is not through company policy it is by the ballot box
because the united states military is product of our democracy it aims to fight with precision and focus on limiting harm to innocent civilians xe to far greater extent than is the case with other less democratic major powers the technology behind project maven promises to reduce collateral damage still further making any decision by google to withhold it morally complex
since the pentagon xe engagement with silicon valley has been conducted through group called defense innovation unit experimental which helped lead from until last year that integrates technology from start ups into military missions the group arose not from the paranoid war room of xe cdr strangelove xe but rather from the more prosaic reality that most innovation today xe unlike that of two generations ago xe takes place in the commercial sector not government labs
apple and google each have market capitalization twice as large as that of the entire united states defense industry the only way the military can continue protecting our nation and preserving the relative peace the world has enjoyed since world war ii is by integrating the newest technology into its systems denying the military access to this technology would over time cripple it which would be calamitous for the nation and the world
partnership with the pentagon is also in companies xe interest working on important tough military problems helps refine their products improving the global competitiveness of american industry even beyond the usual incentives created by federal research and development which helped spur innovations like siri and the internet there is value to the industry in having access to the military xe operational testing and unique data sets
the debate at google is vital and timely engineers everywhere should closely follow how the military uses new classes of technology and object if those uses violate our values but if the goal of silicon valley technologists is to wall themselves off from the pentagon xe most pressing needs they must concede that this will hurt both our security and industrial strength
moving past the current debate requires all sides to focus on the values we hold in common those in uniform working to protect the nation from threatening world are just as worried by how novel technologies could be misused as the engineers who create them
they also hold dear motto of xe cdon xe be evil xe their commitment to this ideal goes beyond corporate code of conduct it begins with an oath to uphold the constitution and duty that may require the ultimate sacrifice to preserve our form of self government that is powerful basis for shared concern about the new technologies that will ineluctably figure in peace and in war

san francisco xe silicon valley start up recently unveiled drone that can set course entirely on its own handy smartphone app allows the user to tell the airborne drone to follow someone once the drone starts tracking its subject will find it remarkably hard to shake
the drone is meant to be fun gadget xe sort of flying selfie stick but it is not unreasonable to find this automated bloodhound little unnerving
on tuesday group of artificial intelligence researchers and policymakers from prominent labs and think tanks in both the united states and britain released report that described how rapidly evolving and increasingly affordable technologies could be used for malicious purposes they proposed preventive measures including being careful with how research is shared don xe spread it widely until you have good understanding of its risks
experts and pundits have discussed the threats created by the technology for years but this is among the first efforts to tackle the issue head on and the little tracking drone helps explain what they are worried about
the drone made by company called skydio and announced this month costs it was made with technological building blocks that are available to anyone ordinary cameras open source software and low cost computer chips
in time putting these pieces together xe researchers call them dual use technologies xe will become increasingly easy and inexpensive how hard would it be to make similar but dangerous device
xe cthis stuff is getting more available in every sense xe said one of skydio xe founders adam bry these same technologies are bringing new level of autonomy to cars warehouse robots security cameras and wide range of internet services
but at times new systems also exhibit strange and unexpected behavior because the way they learn from large amounts of data is not entirely understood that makes them vulnerable to manipulation today xe computer vision algorithms for example can be fooled into seeing things that are not there
xe cthis becomes problem as these systems are widely deployed xe said miles brundage research fellow at the university of oxford xe future of humanity institute and one of the report xe primary authors xe cit is something the community needs to get ahead of xe
the report warns against the misuse of drones and other autonomous robots but there may be bigger concerns in less obvious places said paul scharre another author of the report who had helped set policy involving autonomous systems and emerging weapons technologies at the defense department and is now senior fellow at the center for new american security
xe cdrones have really captured the imagination xe he said xe cbut what is harder to anticipate xe and wrap our heads around xe is all the less tangible ways that is being integrated into our lives xe
the rapid evolution of is creating new security holes if computer vision system can be fooled into seeing things that are not there for example miscreants can circumvent security cameras or compromise driverless car
researchers are also developing systems that can find and exploit security holes in all sorts of other systems mr scharre said these systems can be used for both defense and offense
automated techniques will make it easier to carry out attacks that now require extensive human labor including xe cspear phishing xe which involves gathering and exploiting personal data of victims in the years to come the report said machines will be more adept at collecting and deploying this data on their own
systems are increasingly adept at generating believable audio and video on their own this will accelerate the progress of virtual reality online games and movie animation it will also make it easier for bad actors to spread misinformation online the report said
this is already beginning to happen through technology called xe cdeepfakes xe which provides simple way of grafting anyone xe head onto pornographic video xe or put words into the mouth of the president
some believe concerns over the progress of are overblown alex dalyac chief executive and co founder of computer vision start up called tractable acknowledged that machine learning will soon produce fake audio and video that humans cannot distinguish from the real thing but he believes other systems will also get better at identifying misinformation ultimately he said these systems will win the day
to others that sounds like an endless cat and mouse game between systems trying to create the fake content and those trying to identify it
xe cwe need to assume that there will be advances on both sides xe mr scharre said

san francisco xe youtube will disable comments on most videos that include children and younger after coming under fire for failing to keep pedophiles from posting suggestive remarks on such videos the company said on thursday
youtube which is owned by google said in blog post that over the next few months it would suspend comments on videos of young minors xe those and under xe and older teenagers that may risk xe cattracting predatory behavior xe
the move is response to the latest content related crisis to confront youtube video documenting how pedophiles have used comments on videos of children to guide other predators after the video highlighting the practice went viral several companies whose advertisements had appeared in the videos at issue said they would boycott youtube
in general the videos did not violate youtube xe standards and showed mostly innocent behavior like young girls doing gymnastics or playing twister but the comments posted below the videos became overrun with suggestive remarks directed at the children
youtube said last week that it had disabled comments on tens of millions of videos featuring children under the company said it planned to alter its algorithm over the next several months to create blanket policy
xe crecently there have been some deeply concerning incidents regarding child safety on youtube xe susan wojcicki company xe chief executive wrote in post on twitter announcing the move xe cnothing is more important to us than ensuring the safety of young people on the platform xe
the company said it would make an exception for small number of channels on the site that feature content considered to be at less risk for attracting pedophiles such as toy review videos the channels will be required to actively moderate comments
youtube said it would use new machine learning system to identify and remove predators xe comments the company which has said it removes hundreds of millions of comments from videos every quarter for violating its rules estimated that the new approach would double the number of comments flagged for removal
youtube has struggled to keep up with pedophiles xe sometimes subtle methods for leaving suggestive remarks on videos of children
rather than making flagrantly sexual statements commenters have posted time stamps directing others to moments in videos that can appear compromising when paused like girl xe backside or bare legs in some instances the commenters in question simply posted strings of sexually suggestive emojis

washington xe behind the white house xe plan to punish china with tariffs and other restrictions is growing concern that beijing is using industrial policy to dominate industries of the future at the expense of the united states and other nations
on thursday the trump administration laid out its case in page report entitled xe chow china xe economic aggression threatens the technologies and intellectual property of the united states and the world xe it exhaustively details the steps chinese officials take to protect and promote their domestic industries and disadvantage foreign competitors including the use of government subsidies cyberespionage and forced intellectual property transfers to chinese companies from american and other foreign firms
the united states is trying to derail china xe dominance by punishing beijing but it has yet to detail how it plans to build america xe dominance in industries that will power economic and job growth in the future or cultivate what the administration officials call the xe ccrown jewels of american technology and intellectual property xe
speaking with reporters on tuesday senior administration official said mr trump xe tariffs are designed to benefit american high tech industries from the sort of xe cpredation xe china has used in the past
many economists say those steps are insufficient xe and possibly counterproductive xe to position american companies to compete in emerging high tech globalized industries they say the administration needs proactive strategy to bolster american innovation and technology that includes investing in federal research and development spending worker skills and attracting more high caliber foreign students to american graduate programs and fostering advanced industries such as biodefense and artificial intelligence
whether industries like semiconductors thrive going forward in the united states xe cwill depend not on america xe success in curbing china xe progress but rather on its ability to sustain and support innovation by companies xe laura xe andrea tyson former top economic adviser to president bill clinton wrote this week
instead of targeting innovation the administration xe policy efforts to date have focused largely on supporting legacy industries like coal mining and steel production which have shed hundreds of thousands of jobs in recent decades and which few economists expect to generate significant job growth in the years to come
china meanwhile targets support to companies that demonstrate winning strategy for growth the government forces subsidized and protected firms to compete on the global marketplace shutting down those that are unable to perform said ann harrison an economist who specializes in industrial policy at the university of pennsylvania xe wharton school
xe cfirms are supported but if it xe not working they cut it out xe she said xe cthat xe really different from trump xe industrial policy what we xe re really doing now is we xe re not supporting emerging industries we xe re bailing out failing industries xe
many experts worry the united states is not doing enough to help its own advanced industries compete xe not just against china but the rest of the world
experts in artificial intelligence say the administration should push for more investment in academic and government research instead of cutting back on scientific research across the government they say administration immigration policies have spooked many foreign born artificial intelligence researchers based in the united states
canada south korea france and britain have ramped up government spending in an effort to ensure that they retain and attract top talent and promote artificial intelligence research china has unveiled plan to become the world leader in the field and create domestic industry worth billion by committing billions of dollars to the effort
at the tail end of the obama administration the office of science and technology policy in the white house began to address the industry xe development but after mr trump took office the office xe work in that area seemed to stagnate the administration has yet to name director for the office which is currently run by its deputy chief technology officer michael kratsios who used to work with silicon valley venture capitalist peter thiel it recently convened meeting of companies working in artificial intelligence at the white house in which mr kratsios indicated the administration would take hands off approach to the industry xe development
xe cif we don xe have the government setting big goals then we will just see business as usual the private sector will continue to optimize for its own problems pulling people out of universities and not really giving back to government because that is not its priority xe said jack clark who oversees policy for openai an independent artificial intelligence lab based in san francisco xe cacademia will get left behind and the government will have no clear mandate in this very important area xe
the united states has long history of industrial policy including the obama administration xe bailout of the automotive industry during the financial crisis and its subsequent efforts to foster advanced manufacturing
xe cwe sought to have strategic focus xe said gene sperling who directed the national economic council for much of the obama administration xe cthat did accept that there were strong positive impacts for innovation and jobs in not just protecting the manufacturing base xe as was done with the auto rescue xe but making the the attractive place to build what comes next in manufacturing as well xe
policymakers in washington have large array of tools to tilt the economic playing field to help particular industries mr trump signed tax law in december that reduced the corporate tax rate to percent move that disproportionately helped banks and real estate companies he has relaxed regulations for fossil fuel exploration and other industries but he has not singled out emerging growth industries for support as mr obama did
that is not china xe approach
trump administration officials outlined examples of china xe xe ceconomic aggression xe that they contend have lifted the chinese to domination of traditional manufacturing and positioned china to beat the world in industries like artificial intelligence autonomous vehicles and blockchain technology
the administration is trying to counter that rise with tariffs and it also supports bipartisan bill moving through congress that would give the federal government greater leeway to block chinese investments in american companies practice that the administration official called xe ccolonization by purchase xe
many economists and lawmakers applaud the administration xe efforts to crack down on chinese intellectual property theft
fighting chinese intellectual property theft is critical to supporting american industries xe cit is something that is very real xe said chang tai hsieh an economist who focuses on growth and development issues at the university of chicago xe booth school of business xe cit happens all the time it is generally viewed by many of these firms as just the way you do business in china xe
but he said that fight may be best waged in american courtrooms not trade negotiations and that the administration may have missed potential victory on that front by recently deciding to soften penalties on chinese smartphone maker zte
the commerce department had previously barred the company from selling into the united states for seven years because of violations of american sanctions that earlier decision mr hsieh said had chinese companies xe cterrified xe

san francisco xe uber is in talks to sell stake in its self driving technologies unit to softbank and other investors for as much as billion as the ride hailing company prepares to go public according to four people with knowledge of the matter
the talks are still underway and may not result in an investment said the people who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly apart from softbank the investor consortium includes an automaker they added
under the terms of the proposed deal investors would purchase from pool of uber stock specifically earmarked for the self driving technologies unit uber would maintain majority control of the self driving arm and would use the investment to fund its research and development the deal would value the self driving business at billion to billion the people said
uber filed confidentially to go public in december in what would be one of the largest tech initial public offerings of recent years the company based in san francisco could hit valuation of billion when it reaches the stock market
but uber is under scrutiny for its losses xe its net loss was million in the fourth quarter xe and self driving technologies are expensive billion infusion could ease worries about how costly it is to develop autonomous cars
the proposed investment was earlier reported by the wall street journal
uber has for years invested heavily in self driving cars which it has said will eventually become primary mode of transportation replacing its human drivers but its autonomous unit formed in loses between million and million each quarter its fleet of vehicles was also grounded for nine months last year after one of the autonomous cars struck and killed pedestrian in arizona in the past uber has considered spinning off the unit as separate entity
uber freight the company xe long haul trucking business also has separate valuation based on pools of equity specifically earmarked for the unit as part of an agreement with employees the company rewarded them with equity in uber freight as stand alone business late last year
softbank is already major investor in uber after it acquired about percent of the ride hailing firm xe stock last year at significant discount in addition to uber softbank has poured money into ride hailing companies such as ola in india and grab in southeast asia
softbank has also invested in businesses focused on autonomous vehicles in mid the firm invested billion in gm cruise holdings division of general motors structuring cruise as separate entity made it possible for general motors to isolate the losses from its autonomous division
in august toyota invested million in uber the move was meant to let uber put its self driving technology in toyota vehicles
xe ctoyota constantly reviews and considers various options for investment but we do not have anything to announce about further investment in uber at this time xe toyota spokeswoman said on wednesday

san francisco xe google reeling from an employee protest over the use of artificial intelligence for military purposes said thursday that it would not use for weapons or for surveillance that violates human rights but it will continue to work with governments and the military
the new rules were part of set of principles google unveiled relating to the use of artificial intelligence in company blog post sundar pichai the chief executive laid out seven objectives for its technology including xe cavoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias xe and xe cbe socially beneficial xe
google also detailed applications of the technology that the company will not pursue including for xe cweapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people xe and xe ctechnologies that gather or use information for surveillance violating internationally accepted norms of human rights xe
but google said it would continue to work with governments and military using in areas including cybersecurity training and military recruitment
xe cwe recognize that such powerful technology raises equally powerful questions about its use how is developed and used will have significant impact on society for many years to come xe mr pichai wrote
concern over the potential uses of artificial intelligence bubbled over at google when the company secured contract to work on the pentagon xe project maven program which uses to interpret video images and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes
more than google employees signed petition protesting the contract and handful of employees resigned in response google said it would not seek to renew the maven contract when it expired next year and pledged to draft set of guidelines for appropriates uses of
mr pichai did not address the maven program or the pressure from employees it xe not clear whether these guidelines would have precluded google from pursuing the maven contract since the company has insisted repeatedly that its work for the pentagon was not for xe coffensive purposes xe
google has bet its future on artificial intelligence and company executives believe the technology could have an impact comparable to the development of the internet
google promotes the benefits of artificial intelligence for tasks like early diagnosis of diseases and the reduction of spam in email but it has also experienced some of the perils associated with including youtube recommendations pushing users to extremist videos or google photos image recognition software categorizing black people as gorillas
while most of google xe guidelines are unsurprising for company that prides itself on altruistic goals it also included noteworthy rule about how its technology could be shared outside the company
xe cwe will reserve the right to prevent or stop uses of our technology if we become aware of uses that are inconsistent with these principles xe the company said
like most of the top corporate labs which are laden with former and current academics google openly publishes much of its research that means others can recreate and reuse many of its methods and ideas but google is joining other labs in saying it may hold back certain research if it believes others will misuse it
deepmind top lab owned by google xe parent company alphabet is considering whether it should refrain from publishing certain research because it may be dangerous openai lab founded by the tesla chief executive elon musk and others recently released new charter indicating it could do much the same xe even though it was founded on the principle that it would openly share all its research

san francisco xe apple has hired google xe chief of search and artificial intelligence john giannandrea major coup in its bid to catch up to the artificial intelligence technology of its rivals
apple said on tuesday that mr giannandrea will run apple xe xe cmachine learning and strategy xe and become one of executives who report directly to apple xe chief executive timothy cook
the hire is victory for apple which many silicon valley executives and analysts view as lagging its peers in artificial intelligence an increasingly crucial technology for companies that enable computers to handle more complex tasks like understanding voice commands or identifying people in images
xe cour technology must be infused with the values we all hold dear xe mr cook said tuesday morning in an email to staff members obtained by the new york times xe cjohn shares our commitment to privacy and our thoughtful approach as we make computers even smarter and more personal xe
while apple has risen to become the world xe most valuable publicly traded company on the back of the iphone many in the technology industry consider the iphone xe digital assistant siri to be less effective than its counterparts at google and amazon
mr giannandrea year old native of scotland known to colleagues as helped lead the push to integrate throughout google xe products including internet search gmail and its own digital assistant google assistant
he joined google in when it purchased metaweb start up where he served as chief technology officer metaweb was building what it described as xe cdatabase of the world xe knowledge xe which google eventually rolled into its search engine to deliver direct answers to users xe queries try googling xe chow old is steph curry xe during mr giannandrea xe tenure research became increasingly important inside google with its primary lab google brain moving into space beside the chief executive sundar pichai
engineers with expertise are some of the most sought after people in silicon valley with salaries sometimes exceeding eight figures when news broke monday that mr giannandrea was unexpectedly stepping down as google xe chief he immediately became perhaps the most eligible tech executive on the market by tuesday it became clear he was never really on the market
apple has made other high profile hires in the field including the carnegie mellon professor russ salakhutdinov mr salakhutdinov studied at the university of toronto under geoffrey hinton who helps oversee the google brain lab
apple has taken strong stance on protecting the privacy of people who use its devices and online services which could put it at disadvantage when building services using neural networks
researchers train these systems by pooling enormous amounts of digital data sometimes from customer services apple however has said it is developing methods that would allow it to train these algorithms without compromising privacy
on the debate over whether humanity should be worried about the rapidly accelerating improvements in mr giannandrea told mit technology review in an interview last year that the concerns were overblown
xe cwhat object to is this assumption that we will leap to some kind of superintelligent system that will then make humans obsolete xe he said xe ci understand why people are concerned about it but think it xe gotten way too much airtime just see no technological basis as to why this is imminent at all xe

as west coast companies storm into new york they are reshaping the city xe neighborhoods and changing its identity from hub of finance fashion and media to one increasingly centered on technology
google said on monday that it planned to create billion campus just south of the west village the internet company xe push into one of manhattan xe most famous neighborhoods positions it to become one of new york xe biggest occupants of office space allowing it to double its work force in the city to more than over the next decade
google follows amazon which said last month that it planned to open new office in queens that will house as many as employees apple facebook linkedin and uber have also embarked on recent new york expansions xe much of it driven by hunt for talent each is creating hundreds or thousands of high paying jobs and leasing or building millions of square feet in commercial real estate
xe claw medicine and finance have been superseded by information technologies xe said mitchell moss an urban planning professor at new york university who studies the city xe economy
google xe new campus selection of hudson square once an industrial district just south of the west village strengthens its grip on manhattan xe west side likely accelerating the neighborhood xe changes that would mirror how google transformed manhattan xe chelsea neighborhood where it has had an office since the company bought chelsea market for billion earlier this year and an adjacent building in and it leases other space in the area about minute walk from its new offices
the centerpiece of the new million square foot campus will be the st john xe terminal building near the holland tunnel on washington street with google also set to occupy space at two buildings nearby on hudson street altogether the company will expand its footprint in manhattan by third to about million square feet
xe cnew york city continues to be great source of diverse world class talent xe ruth porat google xe chief financial officer said in statement on monday xe cthat xe what brought google to the city in and that xe what keeps us here xe
read our article chronicling google xe slow expansion in new york
new york xe transformation into tech center began after the financial crisis when mayor michael bloomberg focused on the industry as an engine of future growth his administration sought to upgrade the tech skills of the local labor force campaign that led cornell university and its partner technion israel institute of technology to open an applied science and engineering campus on roosevelt island tech initiatives xe new courses buildings and research institutes xe are also underway at columbia university new york university and the city university of new york
google arrived in new york when it opened an advertising sales office in it added an engineering team in the city in and has steadily expanded since
other big tech companies quickly followed amazon and facebook each now have more than employees in new york while apple and salesforce each employ more than linkedin has large office in the empire state building and ibm chose new york as the base for its watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions
since jobs in tech and advertising in new york have increased percent to while financial services jobs in the city increased about percent to according to an analysis of federal data by ken mccarthy principal economist at the real estate firm cushman amp wakefield by contrast the education and health sectors employ about one million people in new york while the hospitality industry employs according to his analysis
mr mccarthy said federal data categorized jobs based on the employer meaning any bank employee is counted as finance but new york xe traditional industries xe banking retailing and consulting xe have also added thousands of tech jobs jpmorgan chase goldman sachs and citigroup each employ thousands of tech workers including many in new fields like data science blockchain and machine learning
and new york xe tech sector is accelerating over the past year the share of new york postings on the job site indeed increased nearly percent for tech jobs and just percent for finance and accounting jobs about percent of all new york jobs posted on indeed are now tech related the site said compared with percent for finance and accounting
that growth has made san francisco which is gateway to silicon valley sort of sister city to new york as result the air route between them is one of the nation xe most competitive and heavily trafficked
xe cthere is more economic connectivity between new york and san francisco than between new york and any of the declining upstate cities xe mr moss said
google xe expansion in manhattan contrasts with that of amazon xe in long island city where plan to enter the formerly industrial queens neighborhood has been greeted with intense local debate amazon executives who have promised little in the way of neighborhood benefits in exchange for as much as billion in state and city incentives faced protests and withering questioning at new york city council hearing last week
google has expanded quietly and has not asked for public subsidies xe cwe xe ve been growing steadily for the past years without heralding trumpets or asking for support from the government xe william floyd google xe head of external affairs in new york said this month xe cwe xe ve done it by the dint our own work xe
still google has faced criticism in new york the owners of some chelsea restaurants said they are losing potential customers because of the company xe free food at work policies san francisco officials recently considered banning new employee cafeterias in the city for that reason
and some in manhattan are wary that google and other businesses will begin to spread into historic neighborhoods
xe cmy concern is that with google xe concentration in that area it xe going to pull in even more intense pressure for office development particularly tech office development in adjacent neighborhoods like the village and east village where we are seeing it happen already xe said andrew berman executive director of the greenwich village society for historic preservation
mr berman said he did not oppose google xe expansion in hudson square which in the past decade has transformed into commercial district with many of its lofts and factories converted to offices for more than companies many in technology advertising and media today more than people work in the neighborhood and thousands more have made their home there following city rezoning that allowed residential development
but mr berman said the growing demand for offices has led to the demolition of historic buildings pushed out longtime businesses and residents and resulted in modern office towers that are out of character with the rest of the neighborhood
chelsea has also witnessed rapid development over the past decade as it has mostly shed its working class roots and identity as hub of gay night life it still maintains large public housing projects but is dotted with art galleries new condominiums and expensive restaurants
several factors prompted the area xe gentrification including the elevated high line that opened in but some residents have complained that google sped up the process even as it followed strategy of growing slowly
in response google invested in local nonprofit organizations and said it would pay for ferry stop at pier where it is renting office space earning some plaudits from local elected officials
xe cin terms of buying the new buildings we want to make sure that they xe re not chasing anyone out xe said gale brewer the manhattan borough president xe cbut they xe ve been awfully good neighbors in chelsea xe

thousands of low wage workers in xe ccensorship factories xe trawl the online world for forbidden content where even photo of an empty chair could cause big trouble
by li yuan
li chengzhi had lot to learn when he first got job as professional censor
like many young people in china the year old recent college graduate knew little about the tiananmen square crackdown he had never heard of china xe most famous dissident liu xiaobo the nobel peace prize laureate who died in custody two years ago
now after training he knows what to look for xe and what to block he spends his hours scanning online content on behalf of chinese media companies looking for anything that will provoke the government xe wrath he knows how to spot code words that obliquely refer to chinese leaders and scandals or the memes that touch on subjects the chinese government doesn xe want people to read about
mr li who still has traces of youthful acne on his face takes his job seriously xe cit helps cleanse the online environment xe he said
for chinese companies staying on the safe side of government censors is matter of life and death adding to the burden the authorities demand that companies censor themselves spurring them to hire thousands of people to police content
that in turn has created growing and lucrative new industry censorship factories
mr li works for beyondsoft beijing based tech services company that among other businesses takes on the censorship burden for other companies he works in its office in the city of chengdu in the heart of high tech industrial area the space is bright and new enough that it resembles the offices of well funded start ups in tech centers like beijing and shenzhen it recently moved to the space because customers complained that its previous office was too cramped to allow employees to do their best work
xe cmissing one beat could cause serious political mistake xe said yang xiao head of beyondsoft xe internet service business including content reviewing beyondsoft declined to disclose which chinese media or online companies it works for citing confidentiality
china has built the world xe most extensive and sophisticated online censorship system it grew even stronger under president xi jinping who wants the internet to play greater role in strengthening the communist party xe hold on society more content is considered sensitive punishments are getting more severe
once circumspect about its controls china now preaches vision of government supervised internet that has surprising resonance in other countries even traditional bastions of free expression like western europe and the united states are considering their own digital limits platforms like facebook and youtube have said that they would hire thousands more people to better keep handle on their content
workers like mr li show the extremes of that approach xe one that controls what more than million internet users in china see every day
beyondsoft employs over workers like mr li at its content reviewing factories that is up from about in they review and censor content day and night
xe cwe xe re the foxconn in the data industry xe said mr yang comparing his firm to the biggest contract manufacturer that makes iphones and other products for apple
many online media companies have their own internal content review teams sometimes numbering in the thousands they are exploring ways to get artificial intelligence to do the work the head of the lab at major online media company who asked for anonymity because the subject is sensitive said the company had machine learning models
but success is spotty users can easily fool algorithms
xe cthe machines are intelligent but they aren xe as clever as human brains xe mr li said xe cthey miss lot of things when reviewing content xe
beyondsoft has team of people in chengdu working four shifts day to review potentially politically sensitive content on news aggregating app
for the same app beyondsoft has another team in the western city of xi xe an reviewing potentially vulgar or profane content like the rest of the world china xe internet is rife with pornography and other material that many users might find offensive
in the chengdu office workers must put their smartphones in hallway lockers they can xe take screenshots or send any information from their computers
the workers are almost all college graduates in their they are often unaware of or indifferent to politics in china many parents and teachers tell the young that caring about politics leads only to trouble
to overcome that mr yang and his colleagues developed sophisticated training system new hires start with weeklong xe ctheory xe training during which senior employees teach them the sensitive information that they didn xe know before
xe cmy office is next to the big training room xe mr yang said xe ci often hear the surprised sounds of xe ah ah ah xe xe
xe cthey didn xe know things like june xe he added referring to the tiananmen square crackdown xe cthey really didn xe know xe
beyondsoft has developed an extensive database based on such information that mr yang calls one of its xe ccore competencies xe it also uses anti censorship software to regularly visit what it calls anti revolutionary websites that are blocked by the chinese government it then updates the database
new employees study the database much like preparing for college entrance exams after two weeks they have to pass test
the screen saver on each computer is the same photos and names of current and past members of the politburo standing committee the communist party xe top leadership workers must memorize those faces only government owned websites and specially approved political blogs xe group on what xe called whitelist xe are allowed to post photos of top leaders
workers are briefed at the beginning of their shift on the newest censoring instructions sent by clients which the clients themselves receive from government censors workers then must answer about questions designed to test their memory the results of the exam affect the workers xe pay
one question on recent friday which one of the following names is the daughter of li peng china xe former premier the correct answer is li xiaolin longtime target of online ridicule for her expensive fashion taste and for being one of many children of senior officials who come into high positions or wealth
that xe relatively easy one tougher test is parsing the roundabout ways that china xe internet users evade stringent censorship to talk about current affairs
take for example hong kong news site xe commentary that compared the six chinese leaders since mao zedong to emperors during the han dynasty some chinese users started using the emperors xe names when referring to the leaders beyondsoft xe workers have to know which emperor xe name is associated with which leader
then there are the photos of an empty chair they refer to mr liu the nobel laureate who wasn xe allowed to leave china to attend the award ceremony and was represented by an empty chair references to george orwell xe novel xe xe are also forbidden
beyondsoft xe software trawls through web pages and marks potentially offensive words in different colors if page is full of color coded words it usually requires closer look according to the executives if there are only one or two it xe pretty safe to let it pass
according to beyondsoft xe website its content monitoring service called rainbow shield has compiled over basic sensitive words and over three million derivative words politically sensitive words make up one third of the total followed by words related to pornography prostitution gambling and knives
workers like mr li make to month about average pay in chengdu each worker is expected to review to articles during shift articles uploaded to the news app must be approved or rejected within an hour unlike foxconn workers they don xe work much overtime because longer hours could hurt accuracy said mr yang the executive
it xe easy to make mistakes one article about peng liyuan china xe first lady mistakenly used the photo of famous singer rumored to be linked to another leader it was caught by someone else before it went out mr yang said
mr li the young censor said the worst mistakes were almost all related to senior leaders he once missed tiny photo of mr xi on website not on the whitelist because he was tired he still kicks himself for it
when asked whether he had shared with family and friends what he learned at work such as the tiananmen crackdown mr li vehemently said no
xe cthis information is not for people outside to know xe he said xe conce many people know about it it could generate rumors xe
but the crackdown was history it wasn xe rumor how would he reconcile that
xe cfor certain things xe he said xe cone just has to obey the rules xe

in the race to develop self driving cars general motors has picked up another hefty ally
honda the japanese automaker has agreed to buy million stake in xe autonomous vehicles unit cruise holdings the two companies said wednesday in addition honda will contribute billion to the project over the next years
is aiming to develop vehicle xe based on its electric chevrolet bolt xe with no steering wheel or pedals that can be used in driverless taxi and delivery services the automaker hopes to develop the technology into new and lucrative line of business apart from making and selling cars and trucks for consumers
xe chaving the resources and capability of honda will move us faster xe xe president dan ammann said in conference call wednesday
honda xe investment will give it percent stake in the cruise venture xe cthis is vote of confidence in and cruise and what they are doing xe said mike ramsey gartner analyst
the announcement was made before the market opened shares rose more than percent on the day
declined to say when it expected to introduce driverless car but in federal government filing in january it asked permission to do so in commercial ride hailing service next year
waymo the spinoff of google is working in the same direction as are ford motor and uber the ride hailing service
honda had pursued other joint efforts xe it said in that it was in talks with waymo xe before making commitment to and cruise xe chonda was going to struggle to develop their own product so they wanted partner and already had relationship with xe mr ramsey said
automakers are also working on self driving technology that can be added to cars that consumers can buy to give drivers the option of relinquishing the task of steering and navigating to their destination that type of autonomous technology is expected to take more time to reach the market however
acquired cruise then called cruise automation in for reported billion in cash stock and incentive compensation it has since added other properties to the effort year ago it bought strobe company that specializes in laser imaging technology and folded it into cruise
rather than go at it alone has brought on partners to help fund the project in hopes of speeding development earlier this year softbank the japanese tech and investment firm invested billion in cruise as part of that deal said it would put an additional billion of its own money into the unit which is based in san francisco softbank xe investment was made through its vision fund which focuses on the technology sector
in addition to money honda will provide expertise in manufacturing and engineering compact vehicles where space is at premium
xe cwith the backing of general motors softbank and honda cruise is deeply resourced to accomplish our mission to safely deploy autonomous technology across the globe xe said kyle vogt chief executive of cruise holdings xe cwe want to be able to produce this car in high volume when we xe re ready to put it into use xe
and honda remain competitors in the business of building cars sport utility vehicles and light trucks but have grown closer in recent years in they began working together on plant in michigan to produce technology for vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells they also cooperate in battery technology
waymo and others are betting that driverless ride services will spread rapidly once they are able to produce vehicles that can operate with input only from sensors software and computer chips
waymo has made plans to buy up to compact electric vehicles from jaguar land rover starting in it has also agreed to buy up to pacifica minivans from fiat chrysler automobiles potentially giving it fleet of more than driverless vehicles within three or four years waymo is already operating test fleet of driverless taxis in arizona
for now and waymo appear to be ahead of most competitors last month toyota agreed to invest million in uber to help it produce self driving vehicles uber xe effort was set back this year when test vehicle struck and killed pedestrian in tempe ariz
ford is testing small number of self driving cars in delivery fleets and hopes to have self driving car in production by

zhengzhou china xe in the chinese city of zhengzhou police officer wearing facial recognition glasses spotted heroin smuggler at train station
in qingdao city famous for its german colonial heritage cameras powered by artificial intelligence helped the police snatch two dozen criminal suspects in the midst of big annual beer festival
in wuhu fugitive murder suspect was identified by camera as he bought food from street vendor
with millions of cameras and billions of lines of code china is building high tech authoritarian future beijing is embracing technologies like facial recognition and artificial intelligence to identify and track billion people it wants to assemble vast and unprecedented national surveillance system with crucial help from its thriving technology industry
xe cin the past it was all about instinct xe said shan jun the deputy chief of the police at the railway station in zhengzhou where the heroin smuggler was caught xe cif you missed something you missed it xe
china is reversing the commonly held vision of technology as great democratizer bringing people more freedom and connecting them to the world in china it has brought control
in some cities cameras scan train stations for china xe most wanted billboard size displays show the faces of jaywalkers and list the names of people who don xe pay their debts facial recognition scanners guard the entrances to housing complexes already china has an estimated million surveillance cameras xe four times as many as the united states
such efforts supplement other systems that track internet use and communications hotel stays train and plane trips and even car travel in some places
even so china xe ambitions outstrip its abilities technology in place at one train station or crosswalk may be lacking in another city or even the next block over bureaucratic inefficiencies prevent the creation of nationwide network
for the communist party that may not matter far from hiding their efforts chinese authorities regularly state and overstate their capabilities in china even the perception of surveillance can keep the public in line
some places are further along than others invasive mass surveillance software has been set up in the west to track members of the uighur muslim minority and map their relations with friends and family according to software viewed by the new york times
xe cthis is potentially totally new way for the government to manage the economy and society xe said martin chorzempa fellow at the peterson institute for international economics
xe cthe goal is algorithmic governance xe he added
the intersection south of changhong bridge in the city of xiangyang used to be nightmare cars drove fast and jaywalkers darted into the street
then last summer the police put up cameras linked to facial recognition technology and big outdoor screen photos of lawbreakers were displayed alongside their names and government numbers people were initially excited to see their faces on the board said guan yue spokeswoman until propaganda outlets told them it was punishment
xe cif you are captured by the system and you don xe see it your neighbors or colleagues will and they will gossip about it xe she said xe cthat xe too embarrassing for people to take xe
china xe new surveillance is based on an old idea only strong authority can bring order to turbulent country mao zedong took that philosophy to devastating ends as his top down rule brought famine and then the cultural revolution
his successors also craved order but feared the consequences of totalitarian rule they formed new understanding with the chinese people in exchange for political impotence they would be mostly left alone and allowed to get rich
it worked censorship and police powers remained strong but china xe people still found more freedom that new attitude helped usher in decades of breakneck economic growth
today that unwritten agreement is breaking down
china xe economy isn xe growing at the same pace it suffers from severe wealth gap after four decades of fatter paychecks and better living its people have higher expectations
xi jinping china xe top leader has moved to solidify his power changes to chinese law mean he could rule longer than any leader since mao and he has undertaken broad corruption crackdown that could make him plenty of enemies
for support he has turned to the mao era beliefs in the importance of cult of personality and the role of the communist party in everyday life technology gives him the power to make it happen
xe creform and opening has already failed but no one dares to say it xe said chinese historian zhang lifan citing china xe four decade post mao policy xe cthe current system has created severe social and economic segregation so now the rulers use the taxpayers xe money to monitor the taxpayers xe
mr xi has launched major upgrade of the chinese surveillance state china has become the world xe biggest market for security and surveillance technology with analysts estimating the country will have almost million cameras installed by chinese buyers will snap up more than three quarters of all servers designed to scan video footage for faces predicts ihs markit research firm china xe police will spend an additional billion in the coming years on techno enabled snooping according to one expert quoted in state media
government contracts are fueling research and development into technologies that track faces clothing and even person xe gait experimental gadgets like facial recognition glasses have begun to appear
judging public chinese reaction can be difficult in country where the news media is controlled by the government still so far the average chinese citizen appears to show little concern erratic enforcement of laws against everything from speeding to assault means the long arm of china xe authoritarian government can feel remote from everyday life as result many cheer on new attempts at law and order
xe cit xe one of the biggest intersections in the city xe said wang fukang college student who volunteered as guard at the crosswalk in xiangyang xe cit xe important that it stays safe and orderly xe
start ups often make point of insisting their employees use their technology in shanghai company called yitu has taken that to the extreme
the halls of its offices are dotted with cameras looking for faces from desk to break room to exit employees xe paths are traced on television screen with blue dotted lines the monitor shows their comings and goings all day everyday
in china snooping is becoming big business as the country spends heavily on surveillance new generation of start ups have risen to meet the demand
chinese companies are developing globally competitive applications like image and voice recognition yitu took first place in open contest for facial recognition algorithms held by the united states government xe office of the director of national intelligence number of other chinese companies also scored well
technology boom in china is helping the government xe surveillance ambitions in sheer scale and investment china already rivals silicon valley between the government and eager investors surveillance start ups have access to plenty of money and other resources
in may the upstart company sensetime raised million giving it valuation of about billion yitu raised million last month another rival megvii raised million from investors that included state backed fund created by china xe top leadership
at conference in may at an upscale hotel in beijing china xe security industrial complex offered its vision of the future companies big and small showed off facial recognition security gates and systems that track cars around cities to local government officials tech executives and investors
private companies see big potential in china xe surveillance build out china xe public security market was valued at more than billion last year but could be worth even more as the country builds its capabilities said shen xinyang former google data scientist who is now chief technology officer of eyecool start up
xe cartificial intelligence for public security is actually still very insignificant portion of the whole market xe he said pointing out that most equipment currently in use was xe cnonintelligent xe
many of these businesses are already providing data to the government
mr shen told the group that his company had surveillance systems at more than airports and train stations which had helped catch criminals eyecool he said is also handing over two million facial images each day to burgeoning big data police system called skynet
at building complex in xiangyang facial recognition system set up to let residents quickly through security gates adds to the police xe collection of photos of local residents according to local chinese communist party officials
wen yangli an executive at number community which makes the product said the company is at work on other applications one would detect when crowds of people are clashing another would allow police to use virtual maps of buildings to find out who lives where
china xe surveillance companies are also looking to test the appetite for high tech surveillance abroad yitu says it has been expanding overseas with plans to increase business in regions like southeast asia and the middle east
at home china is preparing its people for next level surveillance technology recent state media propaganda film called xe camazing china xe showed off similar virtual map that provided police with records of utility use saying it could be used for predictive policing
xe cif there are anomalies the system sends an alert xe narrator says as chinese police officers pay visit to an apartment with record of erratic utility use the film then quotes one of the officers xe cno matter which corner you escape to we xe ll bring you to justice xe
for technology to be effective it doesn xe always have to work take china xe facial recognition glasses
police in the central chinese city of zhengzhou recently showed off the specs at high speed rail station for state media and others they snapped photos of policewoman peering from behind the shaded lenses
but the glasses work only if the target stands still for several seconds they have been used mostly to check travelers for fake identifications
china xe national database of individuals it has flagged for watching xe including suspected terrorists criminals drug traffickers political activists and others xe includes million to million people said one technology executive who works closely with the government that is too many people for today xe facial recognition technology to parse said the executive who asked not to be identified because the information wasn xe public
the system remains more of digital patchwork than an all seeing technological network many files still aren xe digitized and others are on mismatched spreadsheets that can xe be easily reconciled systems that police hope will someday be powered by are currently run by teams of people sorting through photos and data the old fashioned way
take for example the crosswalk in xiangyang the images don xe appear instantaneously the billboard often shows jaywalkers from weeks ago though authorities have recently reduced the lag to about five or six days officials said humans still sift through the images to match them to people xe identities
still chinese authorities who are generally mum about security have embarked on campaign to persuade the country xe people that the high tech security state is already in place
china xe propagandists are fond of stories in which police use facial recognition to spot wanted criminals at events an article in people xe daily the communist party xe official newspaper covered series of arrests made with the aid of facial recognition at concerts of the pop star jackie cheung the piece referenced some of the singer xe lyrics xe cyou are boundless net of love that easily trapped me xe
in many places it works at the intersection in xiangyang jaywalking has decreased at the building complex where number community xe facial recognition gate system has been installed problem with bike theft ceased entirely according to building management
xe cthe whole point is that people don xe know if they xe re being monitored and that uncertainty makes people more obedient xe said mr chorzempa the peterson institute fellow
he described the approach as panopticon the idea that people will follow the rules precisely because they don xe know whether they are being watched
in zhengzhou police were happy to explain how just the thought of the facial recognition glasses could get criminals to confess
mr shan the zhengzhou railway station deputy police chief cited the time his department grabbed heroin smuggler while questioning the suspect mr shan said police pulled out the glasses and told the man that what he said didn xe matter the glasses could give them all the information they needed
xe cbecause he was afraid of being found out by the advanced technology he confessed xe said mr shan adding that the suspect had swallowed small packs of heroin
xe cwe didn xe even use any interrogation techniques xe mr shan said xe che simply gave it all up xe

book entry
by jonathan knee
everyone knows that the cock xe crowing at dawn does not xe ccause xe the sun to rise conversely we have equal confidence xe cthat flipping switch will cause light to turn on or off and that sultry summer afternoon will cause sales to go up at the local ice cream parlor xe such intuitions are integral to countless practical and moral judgments that fill our daily lives and yet as prof judea pearl and the science writer dana mackenzie note in their illuminating new work xe cthe book of why the new science of cause and effect xe scientists and statisticians lacked common language until recently to distinguish between these very different kinds of observation indeed within academia xe ccausal vocabulary was virtually prohibited for more than half century xe
the absence of an accepted scientific approach to analyzing cause and effect is not merely of historical or theoretical interest it explains the delay in the surgeon general xe reports on smoking for example and likely led to untold avoidable early deaths new modeling tools have vastly expanded what can be learned from the proliferation of xe cbig data xe and will define the potential reach of artificial intelligence more broadly
the subject of causation has preoccupied philosophers at least since aristotle professor pearl has deftly used the arc of his own career xe first at rca laboratories and for the last years at the university of california los angeles initially in the engineering department and since in computer science xe to chart the recent history of the subject
this period broadly coincides with what professor pearl terms xe cthe causal revolution xe three ascending rungs of what he calls the xe cladder of causation xe serve as the central metaphor driving the narrative of xe cthe book of why xe the xe crevolution xe charted in the book and in which professor pearl and his disciples played crucial role is what has allowed researchers across vast range of disciplines to move beyond the first rung of the causal ladder where they had been perennially stuck
this lowest rung deals simply with observation xe basically looking for regularities in past behavior professor pearl places xe cpresent day learning machines squarely on rung one xe while it is true that the explosion of computing power and accessible deep data sets have yielded many surprising and important results the mechanics still operate xe cin much the same way that statistician tries to fit line to collection of points xe
xe cdeep neural networks have added many layers of complexity of the fitted function but raw data still drives the fitting process xe according to professor pearl the causal revolution is what has enabled researchers to explore the higher rungs of the ladder
the second rung of the ladder of causation moves from seeing to doing that is it goes from asking what happened to asking what would happen based on possible interventions professor pearl notes that xe cmany scientists have been traumatized to learn that none of the methods they learned in statistics is sufficient to articulate let alone answer simple question like xe what happens if we double the price xe xe xe cthe book of why xe provides detailed explanation and history of how and when model alone can answer such questions in the absence of live experiments
the top rung of the ladder involves something called xe ccounterfactual xe questions what would the world be like if different path had been taken these are xe cthe building blocks of moral behavior as well as scientific thought xe the ability to look backward and imagine what could have been governs our judgments on success and failure right and wrong
once considered defining characteristic of humanity in recent decades these topics have not escaped the reach of increasingly complex modeling tools those tools have been applied to varied social and scientific problems including the efficacy of medical procedures the impact of climate change and the usefulness of social policies
the professor pearl who emerges from the pages of xe cthe book of why xe brims with the joy of discovery and pride in his students and colleagues he concedes however that his inclination is never to use words when an equation will do xe cto me formula is baked idea words are ideas in the oven xe the resulting book is not always fully accessible to readers who do not share the author xe fondness for equations
the sometimes challenging technical aspects of the book should not dissuade anyone interested in the promise of intelligent systems xe cthe book of why xe not only delivers valuable lesson on the history of ideas but provides the conceptual tools needed to judge just what big data can and cannot deliver notably xe ccausal questions can never be answered from data alone xe
while it is xe ceasy to understand why some people would see data mining as the finish rather than the first step xe professor pearl reminds us that the most important questions will always require xe cus as well as future machines xe to engage in the xe cwork of having to consider and articulate substantive assumptions about how the world operates xe
despite this well considered skepticism professor pearl is remarkably optimistic about what artificial intelligence can achieve and even whether we can make machines that are capable of distinguishing good and evil regardless of whether one agrees with these provocative conclusions we can all hope that in any counterfactual world in which that is the case programmers with the humanity of professor pearl will be in charge

mountain view calif xe in may memo to president trump defense secretary jim mattis implored him to create national strategy for artificial intelligence
mr mattis argued that the united states was not keeping pace with the ambitious plans of china and other countries with final flourish he quoted recent magazine article by henry kissinger the former secretary of state and called for presidential commission capable of xe cinspiring whole of country effort that will ensure the is leader not just in matters of defense but in the broader xe transformation of the human condition xe xe mr mattis included copy of mr kissinger xe article with his four paragraph note
mr mattis xe memo which has not been reported before and was viewed by the new york times reflected growing sense of urgency among defense officials about artificial intelligence the consultants and planners who try to forecast threats think could be the next technological game changer in warfare
the chinese government has raised the stakes with its own national strategy academic and commercial organizations in china have been open about working closely with the military on projects they call it xe cmilitary civil fusion xe
it is not clear what impact if any mr mattis xe memo had though the white house announced in may xe about three weeks before he sent his note xe that it would establish panel of government officials to study issues critics say the administration still has not done enough to set federal policy officials with the office of science and technology policy which would most likely take leadership role in setting an agenda for said that is national research and development priority and that it is part of the president xe national security and defense strategies
nonetheless the pentagon appears to be pushing ahead on its own looking for ways to strengthen its ties with researchers particularly in silicon valley where there is considerable wariness about working with the military and intelligence agencies
in late june the pentagon announced the creation of the joint artificial intelligence center or jaic defense officials have not said how many people will be dedicated to the new program or where it will be based when it starts next month it could have several offices around the country
the defense department wants to shift million of its annual budget into the new office and total of billion over five years according to person familiar with the matter who was not allowed to speak about it publicly
known as xe cthe jake xe the center is billed as way of facilitating dozens of projects across the defense department this includes project maven an effort to build technology to identify people and things in video captured by drones that has come to symbolize the ideological gap between the government and silicon valley
around the time mr mattis wrote his memo to mr trump thousands of google employees were protesting their company xe involvement in project maven after the protests became public google withdrew from the project
the protests might have been surprise to pentagon officials since big tech companies have been defense contractors for as long as there has been silicon valley and there is some irony in any industry reluctance to work with the military on given that research competitions sponsored by an arm of the defense department called darpa jump started work on the technology that goes into the autonomous vehicles many tech companies are now trying to commercialize
but in the eyes of some researchers creating robotic vehicles and developing robotic weapons are very different and they fear that autonomous weapons pose an unusual threat to humans
xe cthis is unique moment with so much activism coming out of silicon valley xe said elsa kania an adjunct fellow at the center for new american security think tank that explores policy related to national security and defense xe csome of it is informed by the political situation but it also reflects deep concern over the militarization of these technologies as well as their application to surveillance xe
the joint artificial intelligence center officials hope will help close that gap
xe cone of our greatest national strengths is the innovation and talent found in our private sector and academic institutions enabled by free and open society xe brendan mccord former navy submarine officer and an start up veteran who will lead the center said during public meeting in silicon valley last month xe cthe jaic will help evolve our partnerships with industry academia allies xe
the center he added will work with xe ctraditional and nontraditional innovators alike xe meaning longtime government contractors like lockheed martin as well as newer silicon valley companies the pentagon has worked with more than companies on project maven so far but it hopes to expand this work and overcome the reluctance among workers
this summer pentagon researcher worked alongside small but influential silicon valley artificial intelligence lab fast ai on public effort to build technology capable of accelerating the development of systems
autonomous systems are based on algorithms that can learn to do things like recognize objects by analyzing vast amounts of data the fast ai project would improve the speed of that xe ctraining xe
the pentagon is also offering an olive branch to its silicon valley critics while unveiling the jaic mr mccord said its focus would include xe cethics humanitarian considerations and both short term and long term safety xe
it was an important step toward reaching xc xa tente with researchers said sophie charlotte fischer researcher at center of security studies at eth zurich university in switzerland who specializes in the relationship between the tech industry and government xe cthere needs to be clear understanding of what it means to develop and deploy these technologies xe she said
will it be enough skeptics want to see the details xe cso far the plans remain very abstract xe ms fischer said xe cwhat kind of systems do they want to allow do they want to attach weapons systems to xe
robert work the former deputy secretary of defense who founded project maven worries that the google protest has skewed the perception of the project which does not yet involve lethal weapons and stunted public discussion of how military technology should evolve
xe cwe need to have an open debate about and its consequences and hear arguments from all sides xe he said in recent interview

the field of artificial intelligence doesn xe lack for ambition in january google xe chief executive sundar pichai claimed in an interview that xe cis more profound than dunno electricity or fire xe
day to day developments though are more mundane last week mr pichai stood onstage in front of cheering audience and proudly showed video in which new google program google duplex made phone call and scheduled hair salon appointment the program performed those tasks well enough that human at the other end of the call didn xe suspect she was talking to computer
assuming the demonstration is legitimate that xe an impressive if somewhat creepy accomplishment but google duplex is not the advance toward meaningful that many people seem to think
if you read google xe public statement about google duplex you xe ll discover that the initial scope of the project is surprisingly limited it encompasses just three tasks helping users xe cmake restaurant reservations schedule hair salon appointments and get holiday hours xe
schedule hair salon appointments the dream of artificial intelligence was supposed to be grander than this xe to help revolutionize medicine say or to produce trustworthy robot helpers for the home
the reason google duplex is so narrow in scope isn xe that it represents small but important first step toward such goals the reason is that the field of doesn xe yet have clue how to do any better
as google concedes the trick to making google duplex work was to limit it to xe cclosed domains xe or highly constrained types of data like conversations about making hair salon appointments xe cwhich are narrow enough to explore extensively xe google duplex can have human sounding conversation only xe cafter being deeply trained in such domains xe open ended conversation on wide range of topics is nowhere in sight
the limitations of google duplex are not just result of its being announced prematurely and with too much fanfare they are also vivid reminder that genuine is far beyond the field xe current capabilities even at company with perhaps the largest collection of researchers in the world vast amounts of computing power and enormous quantities of data
the crux of the problem is that the field of artificial intelligence has not come to grips with the infinite complexity of language just as you can make infinitely many arithmetic equations by combining few mathematical symbols and following small set of rules you can make infinitely many sentences by combining modest set of words and modest set of rules genuine human level will need to be able to cope with all of those possible sentences not just small fragment of them
the narrower the scope of conversation the easier it is to have if your interlocutor is more or less following script it is not hard to build computer program that with the help of simple phrase book like templates can recognize few variations on theme xe cwhat time does your establishment close xe xe ci would like reservation for four people at xe but mastering berlitz phrase book doesn xe make you fluent speaker of foreign language sooner or later the non sequiturs start flowing
even in closed domain like restaurant reservations unusual circumstances are bound to come up xe cunfortunately we are redecorating the restaurant that week xe good computer programmer can dodge many of these bullets by inducing an interlocutor to rephrase xe ci xe sorry did you say you were closed that week xe in short stylized conversations that may suffice but in open ended conversations about complex issues such hedges will eventually get irritating if not outright baffling
to be fair google duplex doesn xe literally use phrase book like templates it uses xe cmachine learning xe techniques to extract range of possible phrases drawn from an enormous data set of recordings of human conversations but the basic problem remains the same no matter how much data you have and how many patterns you discern your data will never match the creativity of human beings or the fluidity of the real world the universe of possible sentences is too complex there is no end to the variety of life xe or to the ways in which we can talk about that variety
so what should the field of artificial intelligence do instead once upon time before the fashionable rise of machine learning and xe cbig data xe researchers tried to understand how complex knowledge could be encoded and processed in computers this project known as knowledge engineering aimed not to create programs that would detect statistical patterns in huge data sets but to formalize in system of rules the fundamental elements of human understanding so that those rules could be applied in computer programs rather than merely imitating the results of our thinking machines would actually share some of our core cognitive abilities
that job proved difficult and was never finished but xe cdifficult and unfinished xe doesn xe mean misguided researchers need to return to that project sooner rather than later ideally enlisting the help of cognitive psychologists who study the question of how human cognition manages to be endlessly flexible
today xe dominant approach to has not worked out yes some remarkable applications have been built from it including google translate and google duplex but the limitations of these applications as form of intelligence should be wake up call if machine learning and big data can xe get us any further than restaurant reservation even in the hands of the world xe most capable company it is time to reconsider that strategy

at war
by kelsey atherton
it xe freezing snowy day on the border between estonia and russia soldiers from the two nations are on routine border patrol each side accompanied by an autonomous weapon system tracked robot armed with machine gun and an optical system that can identify threats like people or vehicles as the patrols converge on uneven ground an estonian soldier trips and accidentally discharges his assault rifle the russian robot records the gunshots and instantaneously determines the appropriate response to what it interprets as an attack in less than second both the estonian and russian robots commanded by algorithms turn their weapons on the human targets and fire when the shooting stops dozen dead or injured soldiers lie scattered around their companion machines leaving both nations to sift through the wreckage xe or blame the other side for the attack
the hypothetical scenario seems fantastical but those battlefield robots already exist today in an early form milrem robotics company based in estonia has developed robot called themis tracked hybrid modular infantry system which consists of mobile body mounted on small tank treads topped with remote weapon turret that can be equipped with small or large caliber machine guns it also includes cameras and target tracking software so the turret can pursue people or objects as programmed this is human controlled system for now and milrem for its part insists that it will remain that way but the components are there for robot that can interpret what it sees identify likely combatants and target them all on its own xe cthe possible uses for the themis xe the robot xe builders gush on the website xe care almost limitless xe
sign up for the weekly at war newsletter to receive stories about duty conflict and consequence
the decision to use lethal weapon in battle against combatants has always been decision made by human being that may soon change modern advancements in artificial intelligence machine image recognition and robotics have poised some of the world xe largest militaries on the edge of new future where weapon systems may find and kill people on the battlefield without human involvement russia china and the united states are all working on autonomous platforms that pair weapons with sensors and targeting computers britain and israel are already using weapons with autonomous characteristics missiles and drones that can seek and attack an adversary xe radar vehicle or ship without human command triggering the immediate decision to fire
under what circumstances can and should militaries delegate the decision to take human life to machines it xe moral leap that has raised fundamental questions about the nature of warfare and that military planners human rights organizations defense officials research analysts and ethicists have yet to reach consensus on
the technology for weapons systems to identify and acquire targets independently has existed in basic form for several decades in the and xe united states war planners experimented with harpoon and tomahawk missiles that could identify targets independently both are in use today albeit with human oversight
the most advanced automated american weaponry has focused on defensive applications when rocket and mortar attacks threatened large american bases in iraq in the army developed the counter rocket artillery and mortar system ram xe rapid fire mm cannon that can identify an incoming airborne threat alert human operator and xe with the operator xe press of button xe track and destroy it with burst of special ammunition that self destructs in midair to minimize damage to friendly personnel or civilians below
those weapons were based on naval gun system the phalanx that xe considered last line of defense against antiship missiles the phalanx was just one of the navy xe automated answers to late cold war pressures soviet naval doctrine relied on overwhelming enemy ship squadrons with as many as cruise missiles at time xe cwhen large salvos come in it xe impossible for humans to be able to say xe you xe ve got to take this missile out first xe xe says robert work senior fellow at the center for new american security in washington xe cthere was no way for humans in the combat information center to be able to keep up with that xe so american planners developed phalanx and the aegis combat system which links sensors on fleet ships and aircraft to identify airborne threats and with operator input automatically attack them with shipboard missiles it was programmed work says xe cto have totally automatic setting and literally the human at some point pushes the button and the machine makes all the decisions xe
it depends on how autonomous they are xe cthere xe type of fire and forget weapon where the weapon itself decides xe this is what see happening in the battlefield and think xe going to have to take out this particular tank because think this tank is the command tank xe xe says work this is his definition of true lethal autonomous weapon system an independent weapon that decides everything about who and what it destroys once human has unleashed it
as deputy secretary of defense between and work was responsible for carrying out the pentagon xe third offset strategy plan to counter potential adversaries xe numerical advantages by putting innovative technologies at the core of united states military doctrine the united states xe first offset in president eisenhower xe day built on america xe nuclear advantage second offset in the and xe emphasized the nation xe advances in computers and missile guidance technology for work the third offset meant leveraging artificial intelligence and machine autonomy to create smarter faster network integrating humans and machines it also meant watching how other states and nonstate actors developed their own autonomous capabilities from expendable unmanned aerial vehicles to tanks or missile batteries augmented by artificial intelligence
darpa the defense advanced research projects agency has program called code or collaborative operations in denied environment to design sophisticated software that will allow groups of drones to work in closely coordinated teams even in places where the enemy has been able to deny american forces access to gps and other satellite based communications code xe cis not intended to create autonomous weapons xe says paul scharre author of xe carmy of none autonomous weapons and the future of war xe but rather adapting to xe ca world where we xe ll have groups of robots operating collaboratively together under one person in supervisory control the program manager has compared it to wolves hunting in coordinated packs xe
code xe human operators monitor the swarm without micromanaging it and the autonomy of the drones means that they are programmed to improvise and adjust as they pursue their preset mission xe cthe idea here is that code is going after mobile or rapidly relocatable targets so the target locations cannot be specified precisely in advance by humans xe scharre says xe cit xe not like tomahawk cruise missile where you just program in the coordinates and then the missile goes and strikes it the drones have to be able to search an area and find targets on the move xe
simpler autonomous system is the loitering munition drone that can fly for some time on its own looking for specific signals before finding target and crashing into it with an explosive payload israel produces loitering munition dubbed the xe charpy xe which is designed to hunt out and destroy enemy radar stations and which became sticking point in israeli relations when some were sold to china in the late companies in several nations including slovakia and the united states have also produced loitering munitions
xe cimagine that we are fighting in city and we have foe that is using human life indiscriminately as human shield xe says tony cerri who until recently oversaw data science models and simulations at the army training and doctrine command xe cit xe constantly in your face as you xe re out walking in the street you can xe deal with every situation you are going to make mistake xe
autonomous weapons he suggests are much less likely to make such mistakes xe ca robot operating with milliseconds looking at data that you can xe even begin to conceive is going to say this is the right time to use this kind of weapon to limit collateral damage xe this argument parallels the controversial case for self driving cars in both instances sensor rich machines navigate complex environment without the fatigue distractions and other human fallibilities that can lead to fatal mistakes yet both arguments discount the emergent behaviors that can come from increasingly intelligent machines interpreting the world differently from humans
in autonomous cars those new behaviors have already had deadly consequences like when tesla model in xe cautopilot xe mode in florida failed to recognize tractor trailer crossing the highway ahead and drove under it killing the car xe owner that crash in was the first of two fatal accidents on highways in the united states involving tesla on autopilot uber temporarily pulled its own self driving cars from the roads last march when one killed pedestrian walking her bike across street in arizona
even advocates concede that autonomous military robots could behave in new and unforeseen ways inducing new errors xe the way trading algorithms unleashed on the stock market can cause flash crashes or pair of dueling book resellers xe algorithms on amazon could end up pricing biology text at million which happened in those possibilities xe and the danger that lethal machine errors could precipitate bloodier conflicts xe will require close cooperative measures between robot armed nations delegations to the united nations have begun discussions on regulating lethal autonomous weapon systems under an existing convention on certain conventional weapons which governs things ranging from booby traps to blinding lasers
in august united nations working group set down principles that could be used to guide future international regulations on lethal autonomy chief among them is the idea of ensuring human responsibility for any weapon throughout its life cycle which could create new liabilities for arms manufacturers the united nations group is set to release formal report with recommendations for future action this month besides governments the group xe meetings attract their share of activists like mary wareham of human rights watch who is the global coordinator for the campaign to stop killer robots an initiative launched in with the explicit mission of keeping humans in charge of lethal decisions in war
xe cwe xe ve focused on two things that we want to see remain under meaningful or appropriate or adequate or necessary human control xe wareham says xe cthat xe the identification and selection of targets and then the use of force against them lethal or otherwise xe those are the key decision points critics say where only human xe judgment xe capable of discriminating between enemies and civilians and keeping sense of proportionality in responding xe can be accountable and satisfy the conventions of war
the way in which we tend to justify war or condemn certain acts xe chas to do with the fact that human beings are making decisions that are either moral or immoral xe says pauline shanks kaurin professor specializing in military ethics at the naval war college xe cif humans aren xe making those decisions if it xe literally machines against machines then it seems like then it xe something else right xe
it xe the ways in which robotic firepower can be harnessed by humans that have spurred some of autonomous weaponry xe sharpest critics in steve wozniak and elon musk along with stephen hawking and more than robotics and artificial intelligence researchers signed an open letter warning that xe cautonomous weapons will become the kalashnikovs xe of the future xe cideal for tasks such as assassinations destabilizing nations subduing populations and selectively killing particular ethnic group xe google which had several of its senior artificial intelligence researchers among the letter xe signatories published statement of its own principles on artificial intelligence in june including an outright refusal to develop xe cweapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people xe
for work the question of morality might come down to america xe adversaries xe cthere may be place and time in the future where we xe re up against an opponent who is less worried about delegating lethal authority to machine xe he says xe cbut that xe long way off and we have lot of time to think about that and lot of time to take action and make sure that we can still control all the weapons xe

there is growing realization that our data is under attack from breaches at equifax to cambridge analytica xe misuse of the profile information of more than million facebook users it seems as if none of our personal data is safe and more and more about us is being captured stored and processed by smart devices like thermostats baby monitors wifi connected streetlights and traffic sensors
in the united states people who are concerned are looking to europe they see europe xe xe right to be forgotten xe by which citizens can force companies to erase some of their personal data as step toward regaining ownership of their online selves and on may the european union will bring into force the most sweeping regulation ever of what can be done with people xe data
this law the general data protection regulation will give citizens greater control over their data while requiring those who process personal data in the european union or about its citizens to take responsibility for its protection the will give europeans the right to data portability allowing people for example to take their data from one social network to another and the right not to be subject to decisions based on automated data processing prohibiting for example the use of an algorithm to reject applicants for jobs or loans advocates seem to believe that the new law could replace corporate controlled internet with digital democracy
there xe just one problem no one understands the
the law is staggeringly complex after three years of intense lobbying and contentious negotiation the european parliament published draft which then received some amendment proposals reflection of the divergent interests at stake corporations governments and academic institutions all process personal data but they use it for different purposes
there xe another reason for the regulation xe complexity and ambiguity what are often framed as legal and technical questions are also questions of values the european union xe member states have different historical experiences and contemporary attitudes about data collection germans recalling the nazis xe deadly efficient use of information are suspicious of government or corporate collection of personal data people in nordic countries on the other hand link the collection and organization of data to the functioning of strong social welfare systems
thus the regulation is intentionally ambiguous representing series of compromises it promises to ease restrictions on data flows while allowing citizens to control their personal data and to spur european economic growth while protecting the right to privacy it skirts over possible differences between current and future technologies by using broad principles
but those broad principles don xe always accord with current data practices the regulation requires those who process personal data to demonstrate accountability in part by limiting data collection and processing what is necessary for specific purpose forbidding other uses that may sound good but machine learning for example xe one of the most active areas of research in artificial intelligence used for targeted advertising self driving cars and more xe uses data to train computer systems to make decisions that cannot be specified in advance derived from the original data or explained after the fact
in the year after the regulation was approved interviewed scientists data managers legal scholars lawyers ethicists and activists in sweden learned that many scientists and data managers who will be subject to the law find it incomprehensible they doubted that absolute compliance was even possible
one expert at sweden xe national bioinformatics platform said xe cwe often wonder like what does the law say about this nobody knows xe or as scientist in charge of computing and storage facilities at major university put it the says more or less xe cthat adequate safety should be in place and so on right xe what does that mean xe
many of the law xe broad principles though they avoid references to specific technologies are nevertheless based on already outdated assumptions about technology xe ci think it xe very clear that they imagined some company that has your data physically stored somewhere and you have the right to take it out xe law professor told me of the xe approach to data portability but in the era of big data and cloud services data rarely exists in only one place
what the regulation really means is likely to be decided in european courts which is sure to be drawn out and confusing process
still the is not lost cause we do need rules about data but legal frameworks particularly when they are long complex and ambiguous can xe be the only or even the primary resource guiding the day to day work of data protection
if the ultimate goal is to change what people do with our data we need more research that looks carefully at how personal data is collected and by whom and how those people make decisions about data protection policymakers should use such studies as basis for developing empirically grounded practical rules
in the end pragmatic guidelines that make sense to people who work with data might do lot more to protect our personal data than law that promises to change the internet but can xe explain how

forget government issued food pyramids let an algorithm tell you how to eat
credit credit erik blad

by eric topol
dr topol is cardiologist
some months ago participated in two week experiment that involved using smartphone app to track every morsel of food ate every beverage drank and every medication took as well as how much slept and exercised wore sensor that monitored my blood glucose levels and sent in sample of my stool for an assessment of my gut microbiome all of my data amassed with similar input from more than thousand other people was analyzed by artificial intelligence to create personalized diet algorithm the point was to find out what kind of food should be eating to live longer and healthier life
the results in the sweets category cheesecake was given an grade but whole wheat fig bars were in fruits strawberries were an for me but grapefruit in legumes mixed nuts were an but veggie burgers needless to say it didn xe match what thought knew about healthy eating
it turns out despite decades of diet fads and government issued food pyramids we know surprisingly little about the science of nutrition it is very hard to do high quality randomized trials they require people to adhere to diet for years before there can be any assessment of significant health outcomes the largest ever xe which found that the xe cmediterranean diet xe lowered the risk for heart attacks and strokes xe had to be retracted and republished with softened conclusions most studies are observational relying on food diaries or the shaky memories of participants there are many such studies with over hundred thousand people assessed for carbohydrate consumption or fiber salt or artificial sweeteners and the best we can say is that there might be an association not anything about cause and effect perhaps not surprisingly these studies have serially contradicted one another meanwhile the field has been undermined by the food industry which tries to exert influence over the research it funds
now the central flaw in the whole premise is becoming clear the idea that there is one optimal diet for all people
only recently with the ability to analyze large data sets using artificial intelligence have we learned how simplistic and na xc xafve the assumption of universal diet is it is both biologically and physiologically implausible it contradicts the remarkable heterogeneity of human metabolism microbiome and environment to name just few of the dimensions that make each of us unique good diet it turns out has to be individualized
we xe re still long way from knowing what this means in practice however number of companies have been marketing xe cnutrigenomics xe or the idea that dna test can provide guidance for what foods you should eat for fee they xe ll sample your saliva and provide rudimentary panel of some of the letters of your genome but they don xe have the data to back their theory up
coming up with truly personalized diet would require crunching billions of pieces of data about each person in addition to analyzing the trillion bacteria from about species that reside in our guts as the project participated in did it would need to take into account all of the aspects of that person xe health including lifestyle family history medical conditions immune system anatomy physiology medications and environment this would require developing an artificial intelligence more sophisticated than anything yet on the market
the first major development in this field occurred few years ago when eran segal eran elinav and their colleagues at the weizmann institute of science in israel published in the journal cell landmark paper titled xe personalized nutrition by prediction of glycemic responses xe
spikes in blood glucose levels in response to eating are thought to be an indicator of diabetes risk although we don xe know yet if avoiding them changes that risk these spikes are only one signature for our individualized response to food but they represent the first objective proof that we do indeed respond quite differently to eating the same foods in the same amounts
the study included people without diabetes the data for each person included the time of each meal food and beverage amount and content physical activity height weight and sleep the participants had their blood and gut microbiome inhabitants assessed and their blood glucose monitored for week they ate more than standardized meals provided by the researchers which contained popular items like chocolate and ice cream as well as nearly meals that consisted of their usual food intake in total there were more than million glucose measurements made that xe big data set
using machine learning subtype of artificial intelligence the billions of data points were analyzed to see what drove the glucose response to specific foods for each individual in that way an algorithm was built without the biases of the scientists
more than hundred factors were found to be involved in glycemic response but notably food wasn xe the key determinant instead it was the gut bacteria here were two simultaneous firsts in nutritional science one the discovery that our gut microbiome plays such big role in our unique response to food intake and the other that this discovery was made possible by the journal ran an accompanying editorial titled xe siri what should eat xe
several subsequent studies by these researchers and others have confirmed not only our microbiome xe importance but also that substantial proportion of healthy people have high glucose levels after eating my curiosity about this led me to approach dr segal and dr elinav to ask if they would test me
few weeks later my data had been ingested by their machine learning algorithm it turned out that my gut microbiome was densely populated by one particular bugger xe bacteroides stercoris accounting for percent of my co inhabitants compared with its average of less than percent in the general population had several glucose spikes as high as milligrams per deciliter of blood normal fasting glucose levels are less than but we don xe yet know what level is normal after eating
was then provided with set of specific food recommendations in order to avoid glucose spikes including that information on cheesecake and mixed nuts and searchable database of glucose predictions for foods and beverages
that sounds great but realized had big problem for the most part the highly recommended foods like cheese danishes were ones really disliked while those rated like oatmeal melon and baked squash were typically among my favorites bratwurst the worst and potentially most lethal kind of food in my perception was rated an if wanted to avoid glucose spikes xe have to make some pretty big sacrifices in my diet
nevertheless it was an interesting first step on the path to personalized diet there is now commercial version of this test based on the research of dr segal and dr elinav though it is much more limited it only analyzes gut microbiome sample without monitoring glucose or what you eat
there are other efforts underway in the field as well in some continuing nutrition studies smartphone photos of participants xe plates of food are being processed by deep learning another subtype of to accurately determine what they are eating this avoids the hassle of manually logging in the data and the use of unreliable food diaries as long as participants remember to take the picture
but that is single type of data what we really need to do is pull in multiple types of data xe activity sleep level of stress medications genome microbiome and glucose xe from multiple devices like skin patches and smartwatches with advanced algorithms this is eminently doable in the next few years you could have virtual health coach that is deep learning about your relevant health metrics and providing you with customized dietary recommendations
the benefits of such coach will of course have to be validated by randomized trials unlike the myriad diets that are being hawked without any proof that they are effective or even safe
we don xe often think of diet as being unsafe but the wrong foods can be dangerous for people with certain risks or conditions xe ve had two bouts of kidney stones to avoid third need to stay away from foods high in oxalate naturally occurring molecule abundant in plants but if you look at the recommendations for my personalized diet many xe like nuts and strawberries xe are high in oxalate that xe big miscue because my pre existing medical conditions were not one of the test xe inputs and as we undergo significant changes through our lives like pregnancy or aging we xe ll need re assessments of what our optimal diet should be
for now it xe striking that it took big data and to reboot our perceptions about something as fundamental as what we eat we xe re still ways away from xe cyou paleo me keto xe but at least we xe re finally making progress learning that there is no such thing as universal diet

san francisco xe microsoft employees questioned the company xe chief executive satya nadella on thursday presenting him with petition signed by more than people that called on the software maker to cancel its contract with the immigration and customs enforcement agency according to two people who attended the event
mr nadella was attending an annual gathering with interns at microsoft xe headquarters in redmond wash when the employees used the question and answer session to ask about the company xe government contracts said the people who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation one employee presented mr nadella with usb stick that contained the petition along with the signatures including from microsoft employees they said
xe cwe demand microsoft stop enabling ice xe mission to punish families seeking safety xe read the petition copy of which was obtained by the new york times the petition also called for all tech companies that support the operations of ice and the customs and border protection agency to xe ccancel their contracts xe
the presentation of the petition is the latest example of employee activism at large tech companies against the trump administration xe xe czero tolerance xe policy on immigration which had resulted in children being separated from their migrant parents earlier this year the white house has backed down from the policy but the administration has struggled in recent weeks to reunite children with their families
workers at several silicon valley companies were up in arms over the issue but microsoft came under particular scrutiny from its employees because the company has contract for processing data and artificial intelligence capabilities with ice the agency had been separating migrant parents and their children at the border with mexico last month microsoft employees circulated letter that called on their employer to cancel all contracts with ice among other measures
in response microsoft said last month that to the best of its knowledge its products and services were not being used by federal agencies to separate children from their families at the border it added that it was xe cdismayed xe by the trump administration xe immigration policy and urged that it be changed
the scrutiny comes as microsoft has been positioning itself as moral leader of the technology industry mr nadella and microsoft xe president brad smith have publicly said they wanted to protect user privacy and establish ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence
microsoft declined to comment on thursday xe petition but confirmed that mr nadella had received the usb stick
the petition was started earlier this month by coalition of nonprofit organizations calling for immigration reform group of microsoft employees circulated the petition internally collecting signatures the group then decided to present mr nadella with the petition and use the opportunity to raise their concerns directly with him said employees involved in thursday xe encounter they said they chose that day to present the petition because it coincided with the deadline set by federal court to reunite children and parents who had been divided under the former policy
xe cmicrosoft is complicit in profiting from violent and murderous mass incarceration and deportation scheme xe said scott roberts senior campaign director at color of change civil rights advocacy group which helped start the petition xe cmicrosoft must take action in the one way that will make an actual impact canceling the contract xe

san francisco xe in rush to beat its rival uber to the public market lyft is preparing to start trading in early april according to two people familiar with the company xe plans
lyft intends to begin its roadshow in which it meets with investors to talk up the initial public offering the week of march the two people said companies usually start trading week or so after roadshow
if lyft wins this race it will be the first ride hailing company to go public the two companies have been locked in competition to go public with lyft facing pressure to be first to avoid being overshadowed by uber which is much larger
the start up founded in by logan green and john zimmer is one of several tech companies pushing to go public early this year slack and pinterest are among the others
lyft and uber declined to comment
lyft and uber have competed fiercely for riders and drivers since their earliest days often introducing copycat services within days of each other in keeping with that tradition both filed to go public with the securities and exchange commission on the same day in early december
the review of their filings stalled briefly when the government partially shut down later that month the review process may take longer for uber than for lyft because uber is involved in several secondary businesses like food and freight deliveries uber and lyft both operate bike and scooter services as well as self driving car development wings
lyft will list on the nasdaq and expects to be valued between billion and billion according to the people familiar with the company xe plans the details about lyft xe pending roadshow were first reported by reuters
the lyft listing is win for nasdaq which struggled to attract tech companies after the exchange suffered delays and technical issues during facebook xe and faced tough competition from the new york stock exchange for tech debuts in the aftermath of the facebook fumble tech firms like snap the parent company of snapchat square and twitter went public on the big board
lyft was last valued by private investors at billion and has selected jpmorgan chase to lead its public offering

putting relationship quality at the center of education
by david brooks
opinion columnist
few years ago when was teaching at yale made an announcement to my class said that was going to have to cancel office hours that day because was dealing with some personal issues and friend was coming up to help me sort through them
was no more specific than that but that evening or students emailed me to say they were thinking of me or praying for me for the rest of the term the tenor of that seminar was different we were closer that one tiny whiff of vulnerability meant that wasn xe aloof professor brooks was just another schmo trying to get through life
that unplanned moment illustrated for me the connection between emotional relationships and learning we used to have this top down notion that reason was on teeter totter with emotion if you wanted to be rational and think well you had to suppress those primitive gremlins the emotions teaching consisted of dispassionately downloading knowledge into students xe brains
then work by cognitive scientists like antonio damasio showed us that emotion is not the opposite of reason it xe essential to reason emotions assign value to things if you don xe know what you want you can xe make good decisions
furthermore emotions tell you what to pay attention to care about and remember it xe hard to work through difficulty if your emotions aren xe engaged information is plentiful but motivation is scarce
that early neuroscience breakthrough reminded us that key job of school is to give students new things to love xe an exciting field of study new friends it reminded us that what teachers really teach is themselves xe their contagious passion for their subjects and students it reminded us that children learn from people they love and that love in this context means willing the good of another and offering active care for the whole person
over the last several years our understanding of the relationship between emotion and learning has taken off my impression is that neuroscientists today spend less time trying to locate exactly where in the brain things happen and more time trying to understand the different neural networks and what activates them
everything is integrated mary helen immordino yang of the university of southern california shows that even xe csophisticated xe emotions like moral admiration are experienced partly by the same xe cprimitive xe parts of the brain that monitor internal organs and the viscera our emotions literally affect us in the gut
patricia kuhl of the university of washington has shown that the social brain pervades every learning process she gave infants chinese lessons some infants took face to face lessons with tutor their social brain was activated through direct eye contact and such and they learned chinese sounds at an amazing clip others watched the same lessons through video screen they paid rapt attention but learned nothing
extreme negative emotions like fear can have devastating effect on student xe ability to learn fear amps up threat perception and aggression it can also subsequently make it hard for children to understand causal relationships or to change their mind as context changes
even when conditions are ideal think of all the emotions that are involved in mastering hard subject like algebra curiosity excitement frustration confusion dread delight worry and hopefully perseverance and joy you xe ve got to have an educated emotional vocabulary to maneuver through all those stages
and students have got to have good relationship with teachers suzanne dikker of new york university has shown that when classes are going well the student brain activity synchronizes with the teacher xe brain activity in good times and bad good teachers and good students co regulate each other
the bottom line is this defining question for any school or company is what is the quality of the emotional relationships here
and yet think about your own school or organization do you have metric for measuring relationship quality do you have teams reviewing relationship quality do you know where relationships are good and where they are bad how many recent ed reform trends have been about relationship building
we focus on all the wrong things because we have an outmoded conception of how thinking really works
the good news is the social and emotional learning movement has been steadily gaining strength this week the aspen institute where lead program published national commission report called xe cfrom nation at risk to nation at hope xe social and emotional learning is not an add on curriculum one educator said at the report xe launch xe cit xe the way we do school xe some schools for example do no academic instruction the first week to start everybody just gets to know one another other schools replaced the cops at the door with security officers who could also serve as student coaches
when you start thinking this way it opens up the wide possibilities for change how would you design school if you wanted to put relationship quality at the core come to think of it how would you design congress

as they recorded another year of strong united states sales automakers said thursday that they saw little cause for concern in the months ahead but closer look shows signs of strain emerging on several fronts
annual sales reached million new cars and light trucks last year rise of percent from it was the fourth year in row that the figure exceeded million the longest such streak the industry has ever recorded
but last year xe increase was driven by higher sales to rental government and corporate fleets sales to individual consumers xe considered more accurate measure of demand xe were flat according to edmunds an auto retail data provider
at the same time the enticing loan deals that many car buyers rely on have started to disappear interest free loans for example accounted for just percent of all finance plans offered by dealers in december that was the lowest level for december since according to edmunds
furthermore sales in got one time lift from the trump administration xe tax overhaul which gave some consumers extra income to spend on new cars automakers won xe have that tailwind again
xe cthis year is going to be tougher than last year xe said mark wakefield managing director at alix partners consulting firm xe cand the next year will even tougher than xe
even though total sales rose in signs of halting demand were clear mr wakefield said while sales of small sport utility vehicles rose strongly last year sales of most other types of vehicles were either down or up only slightly
xe cother than that one segment there isn xe lot of growth xe he said
in addition tesla xe sales more than tripled in and without that increase the industry would have reported decline in sales ford and toyota reported lower sales for third year in row xe domestic market share fell to percent xe its lowest level since the company xe infancy century ago
most automakers posted gains early in with sales markedly weakening late in the year reported decline of percent for the full year but its estimated year over year decline for december was percent the company no longer reports monthly sales ford xe sales fell percent in december
beyond the domestic market automakers face other potential challenges the potential tremors from an economic slowdown in china became more palpable this week as apple slashed its financial forecast citing disappointing iphone sales there
lower consumer spending in china could hurt ford toyota and other automakers because they now depend on that country to drive global growth and some reap considerable profits there ford is especially vulnerable because it has been losing money in china and is trying reorganize its operations there
those concerns seemed distant in the upbeat remarks of officials on thursday
ford said any worries about slowdown in china were not likely to be factor in domestic demand xe cit xe certainly something we look at as global company xe emily kolinski morris ford xe chief economist said of the china outlook but as far as the united states market she said xe ci think consumers are looking at their personal financial situations xe
she added that unemployment remained low and that surveys showed strong consumer confidence
likewise toyota executive played down the prospect of continued rate increases by the federal reserve xe and tougher borrowing terms for car buyers
xe cinterest rates are always going to be concern at some level xe jack hollis group vice president at toyota xe north american manufacturing arm said in conference call xe cbut it hasn xe slowed the industry to point of concern xe
still ford and are preparing for more difficult times both companies are cutting jobs and costs in north america said in november that it was idling five north american plants and aiming to eliminate more than blue and white collar jobs
earlier in ford announced plan to reorganize its worldwide salaried work force of with the goal of having leaner staff by the second quarter of the move is expected to eliminate several thousand jobs
general motors began the year with an executive appointment naming mark reuss on thursday as its resident mr reuss the son of former president lloyd reuss has been serving as the company xe product development chief he succeeds dan ammann who was named chief executive of cruise division developing self driving cars
one thing that the economic outlook may not change is the continued american preference for larger vehicles slumping oil prices xe at about half their level five years ago xe have offered little motivation for buyers to make fuel economy priority and unless supplies are constrained an economic slowdown should keep prices low

half moon bay calif xe ashton carter the former secretary of defense understands why employees of technology companies have opposed partnerships and contracts with the united states government when it comes to artificial intelligence
xe cmy first reaction was xe good on you xe because you are thinking morally and you are thinking about whether what you are doing is right or wrong xe mr carter said at the new york times new work summit in half moon bay calif
the sentiment comes at time of strained relationships between silicon valley technology behemoths and the united states government
when mr carter was secretary of defense in the obama administration he was often considered bridge builder between the beltway and the valley founding agencies that brought together technologists and policymakers
he notably issued directive that stands today xe cin any application of machine assisted weaponry that involves the use of lethal force there shall be human being involved in the decision making xe he said
but those partnerships have been tested in the past year as protests pushback and petitions have circulated widely among employees of technology companies
last july microsoft employees presented their chief executive satya nadella with petition signed by more than people that called on the company to cancel its contract with immigration and customs enforcement
last june google declined to renew its contract with project maven at the pentagon after extensive pushback from employees the project used google xe artificial intelligence software to improve the sorting and analysis of imagery from drones
and in october google executives declined to even bid on another artificial intelligence project at the pentagon valued at as much as billion
these protests speak to the newfound power of employees said pedro domingos professor of computer science at the university of washington and the author of xe the master algorithm how the quest for the ultimate learning machine will remake our world xe
xe cemployees of tech companies like google and microsoft have an extraordinary amount of power which is much different than it was years ago xe he said adding that technology companies were major players in both world war ii and the cold war xe coften companies want to do things but then they have to backtrack because they don xe want to displace employees xe
mr carter was supportive of that kind of employee involvement in his conversation with kevin roose reporter for the times xe cit xe fair thing to challenge your leaders xe mr carter said xe cthat xe true for troops and it xe true for employees at tech company xe
but he said xe ci find lot of things more objectionable than helping your country protect you xe
that xe sentiment echoed by the president of microsoft brad smith in october mr smith wrote his employees public note on the microsoft blog regarding defense projects and collaboration with the united states government
xe cfirst we believe in the strong defense of the united states and we want the people who defend it to have access to the nation xe best technology including from microsoft xe he wrote xe cwe are not going to withdraw from the future in the most positive way possible we are going to work to help shape it xe
but at the new work summit he also shared some instances in which he was uncomfortable working with the government when he had ethical and technological misgivings
xe cwe xe re very excited about facial recognition technology but we also have concerns xe he said referencing partnership he declined to enter with local police force xe cthis is space where there xe been well documented cases of bias invasion of privacy and the potential for fundamental democratic freedoms to be placed at risk xe
the way forward has to be in the hands of technology companies like microsoft and google and of the united states government mr carter said but collaboration is more important now than ever
xe ctechnology and public purpose is the issue of our time xe he said

president xi jinping xe tilt toward strongman rule could put all that to the test
as mr xi starts his second term the chinese government which once viewed the internet primarily as threat to its stranglehold on information is harnessing big tech companies xe capital and knowledge to realize its broader goals for the country
at time when the trump administration is moving to counter china xe tech prowess beijing xe heavier hand could pose its own threat to the country xe competitiveness and to the innovation that has transformed chinese firms into global heavyweights
for china xe government wechat the country xe most popular messaging and social media service has become key tool for policing what people say and do political activists have reported being followed based on wechat conversations chat records have turned up as evidence in court the commerce titan alibaba meanwhile is helping city authorities manage traffic
the police have used technology from wechat xe parent company tencent to monitor crowds at public events jd com alibaba xe main rival in online shopping is helping china xe military to upgrade its procurement and logistics systems state media reported recently jd com spokesman said however that its military cooperation was limited to the procurement of goods available to all customers on its site
in scientific research xe focus for mr xi as economic growth becomes harder to sustain xe tech giants have joined with government institutes to run labs in fields like quantum computing deep learning and human computer interaction soon chinese citizens may even be able to use their accounts on tencent xe and alibaba xe apps as digital versions of their national id cards
american tech firms also do business with governments of course and they too are sometimes asked to hand over user data to law enforcement agencies
but in the united states disagreements can be hammered out in court china xe judiciary is controlled by the communist party making themselves useful to the government is often the price that chinese firms must pay for regulatory and financial blessings xe even for the very right to exist as business
xe cif you see the situation clearly and are able to move in sync with the state you will get great support xe wang xiaochuan chief executive of the internet search company sogou said in recent interview with phoenix satellite television xe cbut if it xe in your nature to say xe want freedom want to sing tune different from the state xe xe then you might suffer more so than in the past xe
phoenix subsequently removed that portion of the interview from its website sogou spokesman declined to comment
chinese tech companies have found variety of ways of moving in sync with beijing last year they injected money into struggling state telecom carrier precisely the kind of company they had long sought to disrupt
regulators picked tencent and ant financial an alibaba corporate sibling to build credit scoring databases though their role in those efforts has since been curtailed still their systems and data would be key analysts say for china xe ambitions to build broader xe csocial credit xe system that would track people xe financial activities police records and other public behavior
until recently tencent xe website said its cloud services helped the communist party xe cstandardize and streamline party building work xe but that page was removed after the new york times asked tencent about it the original web address now points to page that describes how tencent can help local governments manage data
xe che xe scared the absolute bejesus out of everyone which doesn xe normally work in tech xe said ryan manuel fellow at the university of hong kong referring to mr xi who has been more willing than past leaders to purge officials and arrest high profile businessmen xe cthat fear is the antithesis of creativity xe
for many years as chinese companies became major players in online services telecom gear drones and more the government neither boosted them nor meddled much in their operations now though as beijing aims to make china world technology leader it is trying to steer private companies more directly particularly in research and development
the government xe xe cmade in china xe plan which seeks to upgrade national capabilities in electric cars robotics semiconductors and other advanced industries is big factor behind the spiraling trade tensions with the united states
in areas such as supercomputers satellite navigation and drones mr xi has pushed chinese companies to work alongside the military to chase breakthroughs at speech last month in beijing mr xi said that the internet and information technology represented the xe cmost dynamic and promising area for civil military integration xe according to the state news agency xinhua
china xe internet titans have already been roped into the government xe plans to lead in artificial intelligence alibaba was designated in november as the national champion for developing xe csmart city xe infrastructure tencent was picked to fill that role in medical imaging the search giant baidu is to lead for self driving cars fourth company iflytek was named to spearhead voice recognition
divvying up an industry before it has matured risks stifling competition though and shoehorning companies into specific activities could discourage them from exploring others
xe chaving the state define and pick winners and losers is not how long term sustainable innovation really happens xe said tai ming cheung professor at the university of california san diego who studies technological development in china
countries that have tried it from the soviet union to japan xe chaven xe really fared well over the long run xe mr cheung said
china xe record is mixed in the and xe mao xe xe ctwo bombs one satellite xe program helped the government develop nuclear bomb ballistic missile and its first satellite more recently state guidance has helped chinese companies gain ground in high speed rail and renewable power in other fields including flat panel displays and cars the country xe industrial policy has flopped repeatedly
for china xe tech giants working with beijing has become more important for another reason mr xi has tightened china xe controls on the internet and moved with remarkable force against companies that step out of line
sina weibo service that resembles twitter lost some of its appeal as raucous forum amid coordinated crackdown early in mr xi xe tenure on what regulators called rumor mongering last month regulators clamped down on bytedance one of china xe most successful start ups shutting down its humor app and ordering it to clean up xe cvulgar xe content on several of its other apps
as result tech potentates are trying harder than ever to keep the leadership happy
on the third floor of gleaming tencent high rise in shenzhen the communist party makes its presence within the company literal
chart on the wall shows how many employees are party members more than this year another display lists the monthly schedule for employees xe party education this month xe offering training sessions on xe cnew era new thought new journey xe
tencent xe mascot jaunty winking penguin appears throughout with hammer and sickle on its chest
growing numbers of tech industry leaders have also joined the national people xe congress china xe rubber stamp parliament and the people xe political consultative conference an advisory group
in december jack ma alibaba xe executive chairman announced that the company had started billion poverty relief fund at news conference before this year xe legislative session pony ma tencent xe chief executive and returning member of the congress offered suggestions for improving schools and health care
xe cthe general secretary xe remarks were very sophisticated and contained lot of information xe pony ma said after discussing innovation with mr xi according to state media using one of mr xi xe official titles xe ci filled full six pages with notes xe
mr ma continued xe cthis is new opportunity for the rapid development of our innovative companies xe

in when gitanjali rao first heard about the water crisis in flint mich she was shocked that something so essential to community could be compromised xe cit was scary to think about these kids drinking water that was harmful for their bodies xe says gitanjali xe ci felt like clean water was right it was definitely something took for granted xe
gitanjali saw problem that was hurting others and she wanted to fix it
in just three and half months she came up with solution portable device that could detect the levels of lead in water faster and at lower cost than what is currently available gitanjali called it tethys after the greek goddess of fresh water her device uses disposable cartridges that once dipped in water provide accurate and immediate readings of lead levels xe cit xe based on something called carbon nanotube sensor technology xe she says xe cand with bluetooth extension it gives you results on your mobile phone xe
with google at everyone xe fingertips coding tutorials readily available and open source systems unlocking ever expanding possibilities young people like gitanjali are increasingly using technology to solve weighty problems and with refreshingly non jaded xe cwhat if xe mindset these teens might just figure out way to create better future for us all
concerned by an increase in california wildfires high school classmates aditya shah and sanjana shah not related joined forces in xe cbecause of climate change extreme weather events like flooding wildfires and droughts are on the rise xe says aditya who is now xe cwe feel this urgency to protect the environment for later generations xe
the teenagers who live in cupertino calif were already working in the field of environment protection and water conservation and wanted to use their science and tech knowledge to create long lasting solutions xe csanjana and have been coding for long time xe aditya says xe cprogramming is essentially our second language we have good sense of solving problems by integrating hardware and software we live in world of technology with cloud computing and machine learning so we thought xe why don xe we develop device that is able to take into account factors like wind speed temperature and humidity and also use image recognition to identify the types of fuel in the area that contribute to wildfire happening xe xe
and they did
aditya and sanjana created the smart wildfire sensor an outdoor hardware setup that predicts the likelihood of fires before they start with the potential to protect homes and lives and reduce firefighting costs the sensor can be mounted to tree and has two parts device that records and transmits weather data and an embedded high resolution camera that captures images of the biomass the organic matter that acts as the fire xe fuel
xe cusing tensorflow google xe open source machine learning platform we analyze images of biomass and estimate their moisture content to find out the amount of dead fuel xe sanjana says xe cwe xe re getting about percent accuracy xe the california department of forestry and fire protection took an interest and the two teens are now working with the department to further develop test and implement this technology to mitigate wildfire risks which have increased exponentially in recent years
xe cif you xe re dreaming about some potential solution you have all of the resources you need online xe says sanjana who also developed the smart flood sensor xe cprior generations did not have these resources but now anyone can easily learn programming if you can dream it you can do it xe
having grown up in johannesburg kiara nirghin was dismayed three years ago when she saw that the normally full reservoirs in her city were nearly empty because of severe drought so she came up with an eco friendly way to help farmers grow food even when rainfall is scarce nirghin won the google science fair at age with creation she made from orange and avocado peels that increases the chance for plants to sustain growth during drought by percent
xe cit xe lot cheaper than the synthetic material farmers currently use xe nirghin says xe cplus it xe more effective and better for the environment xe known as super absorbent polymer the powder can be sprinkled on top of soil mixed into it or added in tablet form to retain water hundreds of times its mass creating mini reservoirs and allowing crops to thrive in drought stricken areas
xe ceven though lot of people think that teenagers don xe have the resources to come up with solutions and say xe you should wait until you xe re scientist xe completely disagree xe nirghin says xe cteenagers can be very good at understanding problems xe
nirghin is now student at stanford and has partnered with an international agricultural company to develop her product xe ci think young people bring something so unique to the table in terms of their imagination and what they can create xe she says xe cour communities should take advantage of that xe
when young people use technology to solve problems they can sharpen their critical thinking skills and become more confident says eli kariv the chief executive of computer science based after school program called the coding space xe cthere are so many times see students of all ages think of new ways of approaching issues xe he says xe cstudents can figure out things that adults may not know or that someone did not teach them at that point you can create anything xe
josh sheldon agrees xe ckids are fearless xe says sheldon an associate director of the mit app inventor where gitanjali learned to build apps xe cadults learning to code are tentative and afraid to move mouse to click something because they think they might break the computer or crash the program kids are just xe we xe ll try it we xe ll see what it does xe xe
gitanjali says she failed time and time again while developing tethys until she didn xe xe cmy mantra in the beginning was xe just have fun with it xe because didn xe know what was going on xe carbon nanotubes what xe xe she says xe cand by the end of this figured it out because was experimenting and trying new things wasn xe afraid to fail xe
now in eighth grade at science technology engineering math stem school highlands ranch near denver gitanjali is enhancing the tethys unit to be xe ca lot more accurate compact affordable and easy to use xe she says so people worldwide will be able to easily test their drinking water she also plans to use the firebase app development platform to allow tethys users to upload the results of their water test xe cwith that data xe ll create global water quality heat map using google maps heatmap function xe she says
gitanjali now codes just about every day and regularly creates new apps xe cbecause android has an open architecture am able to use third party tools to develop apps quickly and test them xe she says xe calso android is the most common operating system in the world like that anybody in developing countries who cannot afford an expensive iphone can use the app xe
gitanjali xe inspiring journey with tethys was recently featured in the google search on short documentary series and her newest endeavor xe ci want to learn gene editing xe she says
somehow this year old also finds the time to mentor younger children offering her own style of anti bullying seminars which includes little science xe ci start with the message of kindness and then end the sessions with one stem topic such as printing or simple programming or ways to observe problems around us xe gitanjali says xe cit xe amazing to see that kindergartners and first graders can understand problems easily and jump to solutions without barriers xe
armed with technology and determination today xe young people offer hope that humanity will get back on the right path xe cwe are growing up in this reality where you xe re seeing global problems that never existed before xe rao says xe cthat where this creative mindset comes from we want to make the world better for everyone xe

few years ago xe cdigital transformation xe was just another business buzzword today it xe strategic imperative as machine learning process automation and other emerging technologies change business from the ground up
no organization can reap the benefits of next generation technology without putting employees at the center of its strategy to understand why we need to consider the three core elements of digital transformation
the first is speed machine learning and automation can accelerate all business functions from supply chains and customer service to finance hr security and it shared service they also enable business processes that adapt and improve on their own
next is intelligence companies have traditionally relied on xe crear view xe kpis that look at past performance to make guesses about the future these metrics are rapidly giving way to tools that apply machine learning to create real time insights embedded in the flow of work that accelerate and improve human decision making
superior human experiences are the third and most important element digital technologies enable better processes and experiences for customers and employees and leaders need to create these differentiated experiences to achieve their desired business outcomes and yet as with any technology driven shift changing mindsets and behavior can be the hardest xe and most critical xe challenge to overcome
each of these elements is disruptive on its own collectively they represent one of the biggest shifts in the history of work companies can invest in acquiring the best technology to jumpstart their digital transformation journey xe but those investments will be wasted if employees don xe embrace the change to capitalize on this shift businesses need to build strong internal foundation know because experienced this firsthand during our own digital transformation journey here at servicenow
we trained our employees on new competencies that build their careers and equip them to be successful within it we identified four critical training programs that we now require for all it employees communication and influence design thinking machine learning and automation
today we use our own technology to automate variety of critical processes including legal contract processing quarterly financial close employee onboarding technology operations and more alongside these technology programs we invested in organization change management programs to help employees understand how their jobs would shift and make clear that they can now focus on more meaningful work
similarly servicenow customer virgin trains recognized that transforming the employee experiences was key to delivering superior customer service yet they didn xe have the infrastructure and processes in place to improve service delivery within their organization with it service management as the starting point we worked with them to modernize full suite of experiences xe from employee to customer to supply chain now that they xe ve automated tasks and simplified processes what used to take month in some cases now takes day
employees won xe just go home one night and step into new roles in the morning and you can xe change culture by writing code successful change requires investment in communication and training because you need great people and great culture to execute any digital business strategy
perhaps accenture cio andrew wilson said it best when he told an interviewer that xe ca modern digital transformation strategy is all about the human there an irony in that in these days of ultra fast technology the human is at the heart of everything you can be old fashioned you can have them filling out forms they ve just come up from talking to alexa they ve just come from watching youtube if the services at work don feel like that not doing my job xe
it xe given today that business as usual is no longer an option yet in revolution there is opportunity xe for those poised to turn vision into action that xe why companies need to get started on human transformation today
find out how servicenow can help you navigate your own digital transformation and explore more insights from leaders in this space

the chief executive of google has likened artificial intelligence to fire xe powerful breakthrough that is full of risks
earlier this year google said it would not renew contract to provide artificial intelligence technology to pentagon program after company employees protested the outcry showed that tech workers xe silicon valley xe most valuable resource xe are powerful too
gradient ventures an focused venture capital firm owned by google is navigating these complicated ethical issues with anna patterson former head of engineering in google xe division at its helm
created in gradient ventures has invested in companies ranging from start up that makes software for autonomous vehicles to one that is applying to biomedical research
ms patterson spoke with the new york times about data safety xe chealthy debate xe and the changing attitudes of entrepreneurs the following has been edited for length and clarity
where is in the hype cycle
think it has ways to go up actually hype is another word for attention and so actually think the attention is warranted because the applications are important
but it is kind of synonymous with the xe xe lived through it before xe with the xe chigh tech company xe or xe cdot com company xe they would say xe chigh tech company xe in order to kind of gain entree into so sometimes am seeing companies that say they are companies but one of the lines that draw is if the math can be done in excel it is not an company
is at the center of all of our modern ethical issues with things like predictive policing autonomous weapons and facial recognition why do you think that is and do you think it xe fair
think that healthy debate is healthy and think it xe actually good for start ups having the open debate has changed the way the conversation goes with start ups
early stage founders used to not proactively bring up these issues and now they do so xe really happy for the open debate as part of our due diligence process we have step called brainstorm we were already bringing up these issues as part of the brainstorming process and now xe pleased that the founders are bringing up the issue
you spent time as vice president of engineering for at google did it surprise you when google employees protested the company xe work with the pentagon
xe happy that work at company where people can have the internal debates and xe happy that google published our principles in june and those are principles that at gradient we were already adhering to
that kind of outcry has gotten little louder in the last year and not just from google employees but other companies as well has that changed your investment philosophy or strategy in any way
we have passed on companies that we felt were crossing those lines for instance we saw an camera company and it integrated facial recognition and maybe mall traffic and maybe even your purchases and we felt that if you were to do brainstorm with them of where this could go in the future it might make great sense on return on investment grounds and they are getting contracts but we did not invest because of ethical concerns
have you noticed desire to shy away from some of those investments in the broader venture market
they were successful in their raise but the vast majority we xe re talking percent of companies their only desire is to have applications that help people and they xe re all positive
have you advised companies to not pursue lines of business because of either controversy or ethical reasons
yeah getting contract takes long time and it takes long time to build the tech that would enable that contract and so we haven xe advised someone to change their product but if they had two different contracts and they said xe which one should do xe think we would weigh in
do you think there are any sort of fears xe either of bias job loss evil robot overlords lack of transparency xe that are overblown are there any that are underplayed
so mean we xe ve all seen instances where given the wrong data learned algorithm can go awry wouldn xe call it overblown but reminding people to be careful when they xe re building their products to get the data right think we can short circuit those issues
think in general building an product is sort of like the very early disney movies they look magical but actually when you think about it somebody had to draw those drawings like frames second it xe just lot of very hard work so it doesn xe just happen overnight which is sometimes the impression that think people have
see all the hard work that goes into it and see that you can xe really be surprised they don xe just spring fully formed when you xe re deeply involved like that you xe re kind of not scared about the process
xe ve seen some members of the community call for hippocratic oath among venture capitalists investing in because of the ethical challenges what do you think of that idea
we xe re publicly saying that we abide by the principles and welcome anyone else to say that too

san francisco xe it has been years since the roomba robot vacuum cleaner was introduced by irobot
partly inspired by novel robotics approach known as xe cfast cheap and out of control xe the humble roomba was not much of robot it simply wandered around room sucking up dust and debris second generation was able to autonomously make its way back to recharging station
but unlike robots like sony xe dog aibo it did something useful at nonastronomical price it was hit for irobot spinoff from the massachusetts institute of technology
since then there have been waves of failed attempts to create more sophisticated home robotic products from companies in the united states japan south korea and europe there have been efforts to build humanoid robots social companion robots robots that cook robots that do your dry cleaning robots that fold your clothes and robots that change the kitty litter
but there still isn xe second successful home robot category beyond the lowly vacuum cleaner
despite persistent optimism roboticists and researchers have painfully learned that while computers can run mathematical circles around humans things that humans do without thinking are the most difficult for machines john mccarthy an pioneer would reach into his pocket and deftly extract quarter as an example of the most challenging tasks for robot
many researchers have come to believe that the recent breakthroughs in machine learning will not be enough to build robots adept at moving and performing tasks in home that is likely to require several more technological breakthroughs
the continuing challenges in building successful home robot have been underscored recently by the disappointments of several high profile start ups
mayfield robotics which was developing kuri home companion robot with backing from robert bosch german electronics company announced in july that it was xe cpausing xe operations and returning pre order deposits kuri xe demise followed similar fate earlier this year that befell jibo heavily funded effort by cynthia breazeal an professor to build social robot that had started million indiegogo campaign in
pepper introduced as home robot by the french robot design firm aldebaran robotics and then acquired by softbank japanese conglomerate was initially priced at with an additional monthly subscription the robot is now being advertised on the firm xe website as commercial xe chost xe or greeter for flat fee of
the snail xe pace of development in home robots stands in striking contrast to the rapid advance of artificial intelligence in successful products like amazon xe echo or even the siri technology of iphones
xe cnot single human has been replaced by humanoid robot xe said sebastian thrun the roboticist who started google xe self driving car program
japan and south korea have been ahead of the united states in their enthusiasm for home robots but companies there have had similarly disappointing results
xe cat one point remember the president of south korea saying that there would be robots in most korea homes by xe said tandy trower software engineer who oversaw the original microsoft windows operating system and later established robotics development effort at the company
he now leads his own home robot company hoaloha robotics which is focused on mobile robot to permit older people to live independently at home mr trower said that while he remained optimistic that in the long run he would be able to develop robot that acted as partner or an assistant for aging people he realized that commercial product was not on the near horizon
despite those repeated failures many technologists remain optimistic that the home robot is just around the corner
at stanford university which pioneered the original robot arm and first mobile robot in the the roboticist kenneth salisbury developed the prototype pr home robot decade ago
the pr inspired willow garage start up funded by scott hassan one of google xe original programmers willow garage produced another prototype home robot the pr which led to number of spinoffs but no successful commercial home applications emerged from the research
both the pr and pr were early explorations in performing common household tasks like getting cup of coffee loading and unloading the dishwasher and going to the refrigerator and getting beer the robot prototypes performed these tasks but only in highly controlled experiments
now stanford roboticists are working on next generation robot that could potentially work in the home silvio savarese stanford computer scientist is leading team developing robot called jackrabbot intended for home or campus delivery as well as some tasks in the home but getting around house is still difficult even in ranch house without stairs he said
self driving cars xe engineers use the technology xe csimultaneous localization and mapping xe or slam to navigate it makes it possible to create map in an unknown environment and place the car accurately but in home with densely packed objects including humans that move frequently slam is insufficient mr savarese said
in partnership with group of university of california at berkeley researchers led by jitendra malik the stanford roboticists have developed new navigation simulator that has similarities to approaches that have led to advances in speech and vision the system known as gibson environment compiles maps of thousands of real world environments to make it possible for robots to learn to perceive general rules about navigating
so could robot that helps tidy up the house be close
xe cpicking things off the floor is with in reach if we can get the price of the arm down xe said ken goldberg roboticist at berkeley his favorite for new market might be what he calls xe cdecluttering robot xe which would wander the house picking up after its occupants
xe cdoing anything time critical is difficult xe he acknowledged xe but if you are willing to leave the house and come back six hours later xe the house is clean xe
his group is also experimenting with robot that can make bed xe admittedly slowly but he argues that it is not task that has to be done at human speed
the berkeley researchers are doing their experiments using robot supplied by the toyota research institute the automaker is one of at least three large technology companies that have active home robot development projects in silicon valley
many roboticists say they believe that the aging of people around the globe will be the catalyst for the arrival of more sophisticated home robots
xe cthe demographic shifts of aging society will provide in our view strong opportunity for market for such product to start and that we also expect that what is good for aging society will also end up being helpful for everyone xe said gill pratt the chief executive of the toyota research institute
in addition to toyota alphabet xe google research laboratory and amazon have active robotics research efforts that are reportedly aimed at home applications
despite the new investments in research and development veteran researchers are conscious that home robots have seemed imminent for decades
xe cthe problem xe said kai fu lee leading chinese artificial intelligence researcher who is now venture investor xe cis that low cost plus high expectations plus no patience makes it difficult to make great product xe
an earlier version of this article and picture caption misstated the name of robot being developed at stanford it is jackrabbot not jackrobbot

the search giant has been rolling out features and products to make planning and taking vacations easier
by stephanie rosenbloom
flight delay predictions mobile trip planning automatic itinerary management language translation through bluetooth earbuds and smartphone that enables users to learn about landmarks by tapping an icon and aiming the phone at them these are among the travel innovations google has been introducing in recent days and weeks while google pixel smartphone costs upward of the company xe latest tools are free in fact they may already be on your phone nudging google closer to being one stop destination for on the go vacation planning
searching google for hotel or flight was once two separate activities you could run search for flight across multiple airlines or you could search city for hotels now however when you use an android or ios smartphone to search google for flight hotel or even destination you xe ll find blue navigation bar it appears on your screen when you tap your google search result xe be it xe crome flights xe xe crome hotels xe or simply xe crome xe there are separate tabs for flights and hotels like you see on sites such as priceline as well as an xe cexplore xe tab to check out the destination xe top sights and best times to visit and xe cyour trips xe tab where gmail users can see their future and past travel reservations and email those reservations to others travelers can also edit their itineraries and see them offline if they use the google trips app which allows users to check out things to do and places to eat review transportation options see emergency numbers and find out about local currency and free wi fi locations
with the blue navigation bar users can now easily move between flight and hotel options the feature is currently being rolled out on mobile phones in the united states spokeswoman for google said there are plans to expand globally in the coming months
google has also added new features to google flights its online airfare search and comparison tool now users can see what xe included or not with new fare types like basic economy for instance you can find out whether particular fare on delta or united allows you to choose your seat or store bag in an overhead bin users may also be able to find out why their flights are delayed to check your status just search your flight number on google as well as view predictions about whether flight will be delayed based on historic flight status data and machine learning algorithms google said it will share predictions only when it xe at least percent confident of the prediction these days it xe also possible to book certain flights through google as opposed to clicking link and purchasing the flight on the airline xe website or that of third party like expedia
while these digital tools are free they aren xe the only additions that may be of interest to travelers google pixel buds bluetooth earbuds that work with google translate on the company xe pixel phone offer translation in languages including italian hindi chinese and spanish for example let xe say you xe re in cafe in provence you begin by gently pressing the right earbud touch pad and saying xe cgoogle help me speak french xe
xe csure xe the google assistant virtual helper will say xe copening google translate xe the app must be installed on google pixel phone for this to work when the waiter comes by you can touch the right earbud again and say xe cmay have coffee with milk and glass of water please xe google assistant will then speak aloud on the phone in french what you just said in english when the waiter replies in french you xe ll hear his words translated into english in your ear throughout the exchange the phone will transcribe the conversation in english and french enabling both parties to read on the screen the words being spoken
xe ve been testing the buds for language translation in controlled environments and the performance has been impressive of course out in the real world xe where there xe noise and rapid talkers who are not necessarily interested in playing along xe results may be different xe ll be road testing these in other countries soon stay tuned
the buds can be used for other travel related tasks as well by touching the right earbud you can ask for the location of the nearest museum gas station or mcdonald xe request directions to restaurant and you xe ll be shown map and suggested route on your smartphone aiming to trip up google assistant said xe cgoogle make me reservation at nougatine xe referring to nougatine at jean george restaurant in manhattan the assistant replied xe cok let xe make reservation with opentable at nougatine at jean georges for how many xe
xe ctwo xe said xe csounds good xe the assistant said xe cfor two people for when xe
xe ctonight xe
xe cat what time xe
xe xe
xe csounds good for it looks like that time isn xe available would work for you xe it would not but google assistant certainly did
the google pixel starting at the pixel xl starts at comes with widely praised smartphone camera it also has google lens technology which enables users to tap lens icon and then point the phone at things such as landmark an artwork or movie poster to learn more whether it xe about building xe history an artist or how film was reviewed lens can also provide this kind of information after you xe ve taken photo
that said these are early days for google lens just as they are for the pixel buds lens is currently limited to popular images it can identify say the golden gate bridge and mona lisa but not necessarily lesser known objects making it fun to have feature for early adopters who can afford premium smartphone though not yet travel game changer google said it xe working on expanding lens xe range
new features were also added to the company xe smart speaker google home and its siblings home mini and home max home has long been able to assist with travel by answering aloud the sorts of questions travelers type into google search whether they need visa to visit particular country the best time to visit current weather currency conversions how to say xe cthank you xe in another language as well as flight departure times and traffic conditions new to that list is flight price tracking
google home users can begin by saying aloud xe co google how much are flights to hong kong xe google home will then reply with the best current price for the route ask you if you have preferred dates and if you want to track flight prices for those dates say yes and you xe ll receive an email confirming that you xe ve begun tracking prices for that route if the cost of the tracked flight significantly changes you xe ll receive an email alert
this has also been feature of google flights and indeed those who don xe have google home can sign up for route tracking online instead

what you need to know to start the day get new york today in your inbox
when new york city xe transportation commissioner returned from recent trip to california she seemed downright jealous there were electric scooters in oakland new train lines in los angeles self driving cars in the bay area she tried them all
xe cit is an incredibly exciting time to be in urban transportation xe the commissioner polly trottenberg told breakfast gathering of powerful new yorkers pointing to california xe progress
her glee signaled noteworthy and sobering shift wasn xe it her city that was once the envy of the nation when it came to transportation
not anymore the subways on the east coast that allowed new york washington and boston to thrive are showing their age and suffering from years of neglect while cities on the west coast are moving quickly to expand and improve their networks
the los angeles area the ultimate car centric region with its sprawling freeways approved sweeping billion plan to build new train routes and upgrade its buses seattle has won accolades for its transit system where percent of riders report being happy with service xe feat that seems unimaginable in new york where subway riders regularly simmer with rage on stalled trains
xe cit xe tale of two systems xe said robert puentes the president of the eno center for transportation nonpartisan research center in washington xe cthese new ones are growing and haven xe started to experience the pains of rehabilitation xe
in new york ms trottenberg returned to laundry list of messes subway crisis buses that move at snail xe pace the looming shutdown of the train between manhattan and brooklyn and the rebuilding of the dilapidated brooklyn queens expressway
xe cthere is political will to invest in expansion xe on the west coast ms trottenberg said in an interview though she noted that new york xe system was still the country xe largest by far its daily subway and bus ridership of nearly million dwarfs los angeles xe million riders
still transit systems on the east coast are losing ridership new york xe subway has not expanded in decades besides handful of new stations in manhattan xe one on the far west side and three on the upper east side
city officials have been reluctant to embrace electric scooters or self driving cars even as scooters have become popular way to get around growing roster of cities xe including austin tex and detroit xe and provide an alternative to sitting in clogged traffic proposal by mayor bill de blasio for streetcar in brooklyn and queens appears to be stalled
there is at least one bright spot citi bike has become an essential part of the city xe fabric the bike share system has bikes across manhattan and parts of brooklyn and queens and recently announced plans to expand under new ownership by the ride hail company lyft which will triple the number of bikes
only decade ago the new york region was flying high more than percent of subway trains were on time compared to about percent today in the new jersey transit won coveted award three times from the american public transportation association
but in recent years the east coast has been notably absent from the awards ceremony the oscars of public transportation cities including seattle salt lake city and houston have captured the title of outstanding transit system
xe cin some of these growing communities like and seattle they haven xe been blessed with great infrastructure and they xe re trying to play catch up frankly xe paul skoutelas the association xe president said
when seattle xe king county metro won the award in september it was praised as xe ca system that is expanding and innovating to meet rising demand xe xe not to mention program that offers lower fares for poor riders that has served as model for new york and other cities transit ridership in seattle is growing and car use is down
one key difference is the west coast has the ballot measure while new york state does not allow voters to directly approve measures like transit funding in both los angeles county and the seattle region approved measures to boost transportation funding the los angeles proposal known as measure won nearly percent of the vote greenlighting billion in spending by raising the sales tax
xe cthe ballot initiative allows them to proceed without the political angst you xe have in albany xe said jon orcutt director at transitcenter research group in new york xe cit takes some pressure off politicians the voters go out and do it and that creates political cover xe
los angeles plans to build new miles of rail xe essentially doubling the metro system whose first rail line opened in there are now six lines and stations huge machines recently began digging new tunnels for purple line extension to the county xe westside xe part of plan to attract younger people who are more likely to favor transit and worry about the environmental impact of cars
xe cwe had political miracle xe eric garcetti the mayor of los angeles said in an interview xe ca permanent cent sales tax xe
mr garcetti democrat hopes the new rail lines will boost transit ridership the number of train and bus trips in los angeles has dropped in recent years though he blamed that on low gas prices and national trends in declining transit ridership
mr garcetti makes point of using the subway he took the red line recently from city hall to macarthur park to visit langer xe for the city xe xe cbest pastrami sandwich xe he is also deciding how best to regulate the electric scooters that have flooded los angeles
xe ci want to make them work xe he said xe ci xe excited by them they xe re generally taking car trips off the road xe
new york has unique challenges when it comes to funding and governance ms trottenberg said in los angeles the transit system is controlled by mr garcetti while new york xe subway is controlled by gov andrew cuomo and state lawmakers many of whom rarely use the system and have shown little interest in making it priority
if new yorkers had been asked to approve new transit funding in ballot measure during the midterm election ms trottenberg believes it would have won
xe cit would have to be mixture so that we xe re fixing the old and you have to put in some new things in too xe she said
instead the subway xe leader andy byford is pleading with state leaders to approve new revenue sources when they return to albany in january mr byford says it will cost more than billion to fix the system xe figure that does not include any expansion or new lines
in seattle billion ballot measure approved two years ago will help extend the region xe light rail system to miles from about miles
dow constantine the executive of king county which is home to seattle said the city xe culture was changing too
xe cfolks are tired of sitting in traffic xe mr constantine democrat said xe cthey xe re mindful of the environmental implications of driving xe
seattle also wants to learn from the east coast xe mistakes mr constantine said
xe ci made sure we included funding for long term maintenance xe he said xe cso you don xe get the situation we xe re seeing in new york and washington where the systems have been neglected and it xe expensive and inconvenient to rebuild xe

it xe the second american civil war has been won by the other side and you find yourself in heap of trouble with attorney general logan paul the future is very troubling he has dispatched an all seeing eye in the sky to tail you an agile flying machine equipped with cameras and top speed of miles per hour
the drone knows your face your gait and your clothing it hovers persistently behind your back moving when you move stopping when you stop resisting every effort to shake it you run into the woods but you still can xe lose it
so now what clip this article and save it as guide for surviving our airborne future in woodsy park in san francisco last week had an encounter with just such self flying drone and found only one trick for escape hint it involved the indignity of repeatedly running around tree
as the hapless chump in its cross hairs will tell you this being tailed by eyed flying machine has way of focusing the mind
the drone chasing me the was created by start up called skydio it sells for and will begin shipping to customers in two to three weeks the company says it is the closest thing to fully autonomous drone you can buy today
autonomous drones have long been hyped but until recently they xe ve been little more than that the technology in skydio xe machine suggests new turn drones that fly themselves xe whether following people for outdoor self photography which is skydio xe intended use or for longer range applications like delivery monitoring and surveillance xe are coming faster than you think
they xe re likely to get much cheaper smaller and more capable they xe re going to be everywhere probably sooner than we can all adjust to them
most consumer drones rely on some degree of automation in flight dji the chinese drone company that commands much of the market makes several drones that can avoid obstacles and track subjects
but these features tend to be less than perfect working best in mostly open areas just about every drone on the market requires pilot
xe cour view is that almost all of the use cases for drones would be better with autonomy xe said adam bry skydio xe chief executive
skydio was founded by mr bry and abe bachrach xe who met as graduate students at the massachusetts institute of technology and later started google xe drone program project wing xe along with matt donahoe an interface designer
in with funding from the venture firm andreessen horowitz the company began working on what would become the skydio has since raised million from andreessen and several other investors including institutional venture partners playground global and the basketball player kevin durant
skydio xe basic goal was drone that requires no pilot when you launch the using smartphone app you have your subject stand in front of the drone then tap that person on the screen xe now it xe locked on you can also select one of several xe ccinematic modes xe which specify the direction from which the drone will try to record its subject it can even predict your path and stay ahead of you to shoot selfie from the front
after takeoff it xe hands off the drone operates independently in the eight minute flight saw xe through wooded trail sparsely populated with runners and dogs xe the followed its target with eerie determination avoiding every obstacle as naturally as an experienced human pilot might and never requiring help it lost its subject xe me xe only once but had to really work to make that happen
watch this clip recorded by the xe main camera showing the drone following mr bry when he runs it immediately follows him ducking behind trees speeding up to catch him then slowing when he slows much of the rest of the clip goes like that every step he takes the is watching him
time for some caveats skydio xe technology is far from perfect it doesn xe work well in inclement weather or at night it also requires very high powered processor which gobbles up battery life the gets minutes per flight compared with around for competing drones but it will ship with two batteries allowing for another flight after quick swap out
skydio xe drone is also entering crowded marketplace that hasn xe been kind to new players parade of drone start ups have gone belly up in the last couple of years unable to compete with dji xe technical innovation and manufacturing scale
some of the most spectacular blowups like that of the drone start up lily involved overpromising and never delivering on autonomous features skydio xe founders say they xe re keen to avoid that mistake the company showed me the assembly line in its headquarters in redwood city calif where teams of technicians are finishing production ready by hand the small scale operation is meant to ensure quality but it comes at price dji xe latest feature packed drone the well reviewed mavic air sells for third of the price of the
xe ci know this technology is so much smarter but xe just not sure it xe enough to overtake the behemoth that is dji xe said sally french journalist who covers the drone industry at her site the drone girl she was also shown preview of the last week
yet whatever happens to skydio as company its flavor of autonomous tech seems likely to become ubiquitous how skydio has achieved autonomy is at bottom marvel of software rather than hardware and the software is likely to get cheaper and better quite quickly
there are two basic ways for computers to process the visual world they can use cameras alone or they can also use depth sensors like lasers or radar that precisely determine where objects are in space
most self driving car systems use expensive laser sensors known as lidar spinning disk that sits on the car xe roof like propeller beanie lidar was the key technology at issue in waymo xe now settled trade secrets lawsuit against uber the trial surfaced note from travis kalanick uber xe former chief executive that underscored lidar xe importance xe claser is the sauce xe he wrote
but to skydio laser wasn xe the sauce lasers aren xe only expensive they xe re also heavy and bulky that xe why elon musk also isn xe fan cameras meanwhile are plentiful and cheap several years ago skydio took gamble it would use only cameras arranged in eyelike pairs on every side of the drone and hope that it could get laserlike accuracy using ever improving artificial intelligence techniques
xe ca bird doesn xe need lidar to fly xe mr bry told me
the scheme worked better than the team was expecting because an artificial intelligence technique known as deep learning has been improving much more quickly than insiders predicted skydio said it is further along at key perceptual tasks than it had hoped to be and mr bry said the tech was still advancing
what this means is ubiquity as watched the tail mr bry played the scene forward in my mind what happens when dozens or hundreds of runners and bikers and skiers and hikers and tourists begin setting out their own self flying gopros to record themselves our society has proved in thrall to photography if you can throw up camera and get shot of you reaching the summit who xe not going to do it
even regulations may not be ready for the colin snow drone industry analyst pointed out to me that federal regulations require users to keep drones in their line of sight xe and drone that follows you is technically not in your line of sight
mr bry disputed this characterization he argued that regulations allow for momentary periods when the drone is not in the line of sight as long as the vehicle does not interfere with manned aircraft
as for other social disruptions that autonomous drones might cause mr bry was guarded xe cobviously we tell our users to be responsible xe he said
which brings me to the escape plan how do you lose an that has been told to follow you here xe what worked for me find tree run around it very precisely just fast enough to stay exactly opposite the drone so the tree trunk blocks its view of you for seconds at time do it just right and the bird will lose you stopping in its tracks confused
but don xe imagine this trick will work for long

the physical and psychological toll of brutal commutes can be considerable
by austin frakt
sometimes the seemingly small things in life can be major stressors
nobody likes sitting in traffic for example according to one study commuting is one of the least pleasant things we do but it xe not just an annoying time waster xe there xe case that it xe public health issue
according to analysis by the texas amp transportation institute the average american commuter spends hours per year stuck in rush hour traffic in the los angeles area the figure is nearly twice that equivalent to more than three days los angeles times poll found that among residents of that city traffic concerns exceed those pertaining to personal safety finances or housing costs
the total cost of traffic associated with lost time and wasted fuel exceeds billion per year as time slips away idling vehicles add pollution which has environmental and health consequences including contributions to climate change long term exposure to vehicle exhaust is associated with respiratory problems especially in children
another toll is to psychological well being stemming from the sense of helplessness we experience in traffic and its unpredictability this too can be quantified one study found that to save minute of time spent in traffic people would trade away five minutes of any other leisure activity another study found that we deal better with the commuting delays that we can anticipate
stressed out people can take out their frustration on others we xe ve probably all experienced or seen road rage but aggressive behavior can carry over beyond commute
recent analysis of los angeles traffic published in the journal of public economics documented link between congestion and domestic violence from to the study found extreme evening traffic on two major highways xe and xe increased the incidence of nighttime domestic violence by about percent
what the researchers louis philippe beland an economist at louisiana state university and daniel brent an economist at penn state mean by xe cextreme traffic xe in their study is best explained with an example the average evening commute along for residents of santa monica in their study was minutes extreme traffic would increase this to minutes
xe clife stressors act as emotional cues xe mr beland said xe cwhat our work shows is that in extreme cases some people xe responses to those cues can be quite large leading to violence xe
teaching children how to manage stress and traumatic events from young age can be important xe cthroughout life mindfulness healthy eating sleeping and exercise and hobbies that blow of steam all help xe said rebecca mooney director of melrose alliance against violence which raises awareness about domestic violence and related issues in and around melrose mass
officials are not powerless before the problems that stressful commutes can cause los angeles has put in system that charges solo drivers more to use certain lanes of the and highways during periods of heavy traffic this encourages drivers to move their commutes to less congested times or routes study of congestion pricing on seattle xe sr bridge found that drivers using the route and its alternatives were less stressed and more satisfied with their commutes after the pricing change
in addition many states have been replacing tollbooths with electronic and cashless tolling systems like zpass more employers are allowing people to work remotely troubled transit systems in some cities may be partly behind an increase in car ownership in those areas but certain west coast cities are making sweeping expansions of their public transit systems and many cities are adding bike lanes
those who can walk or bike to work tend to have double advantage not only do they avoid the harmful consequences of traffic but they can also improve their health through exercise younger people are more likely to prefer that style of commuting and are driving less than previous generations
there may be more good news in coming decades for those who loathe gridlock although self driving cars won xe cure traffic woes on their own xe the way that economics based approaches like congestion pricing can xe they may be able to reduce stress
if you xe re crawling along in traffic and are late to an appointment but are allowed to take nap play video games watch your favorite tv show or sip on cocktail will that reduce your stress we don xe know for sure but we look forward to the studies on that

pittsburgh xe about months ago shawn blanton professor of electrical and computer engineering at carnegie mellon university met with some of his graduate students to redesign his course on artificial intelligence
xe cwe need to transform this course to make it more relevant outside these walls xe he said
it had only been three years since professor blanton started the class but as artificial intelligence moves from the stuff of dystopian fantasies xe robots run amok xe to the reality of everyday use universities around the country are grappling with the best ways to teach it
this year carnegie mellon said it became the first university in the country to offer separate undergraduate degree through its college of computer science the massachusetts institute of technology last month announced plans to establish college for backed by billion in investments
and the expansion is not just happening in the country xe top science and technology schools the university of rhode island this fall opened an lab operated by its college library
but this growth also means new challenges such as figuring out how to teach the subject in ways understandable to those who are not computer science majors and addressing ethical dilemmas raised by the technology such as privacy and job displacement
xe cwe have to start teaching those who will be practitioners and users in the broad discipline of not just computer scientists xe said emily fox an associate professor of computer science engineering and statistics at the university of washington
professor fox developed an course for nonmajors which was first offered last spring to qualify students had only to have completed courses in basic probability and basic programming far fewer prerequisites than typically needed by students taking
she had to cap enrollment at students because of such high interest
demi tu senior studying information technology at the university of washington is an example of the value of reaching out to students who are not classic technology whizzes she said she was so taken with what she learned in professor fox xe class that she may choose to pursue it in graduate school
xe cbefore taking the class did not know what was specifically xe she said xe ci just wanted the initial exposure but the class really opened up different path for me xe
educators are also struggling to balance what some see as an essential teaching of the deep fundamentals of artificial intelligence with desire by some in the industry to focus on the less expensive less complicated training of workers who can complete the tasks at hand without that deep understanding
or as levent burak kara professor of mechanical engineering at carnegie mellon noted there is tension in teaching between ensuring xe cstudents understand what xe under the hood and what industry wants xe
freshman year may actually be too late to start teaching fei fei li director of stanford university xe artificial intelligence lab and its stanford vision lab began three week summer program in for high school students focused on offering young women early exposure to
she then co founded ai all nonprofit this year six campuses ran programs exposing high school students particularly women people of color and those from rural regions to the technology
xe cwe want young people to think about their future participation in developing or guiding this technology xe professor li said xe ctoday xe developers are not diverse enough or inclusive enough we want to educate tomorrow xe xe technologists thinkers and leaders and instill them with human centered frame of mind xe
the university of rhode island has tried to make more accessible to broad range of students by opening the lab in its library
xe cwe xe re democratizing xe said karim boughida the dean of university libraries
the square foot lab provides workstations for students to take tutorials in areas such as robotics natural language processing and smarthomes and to design their own projects there is also space where students faculty and community members can learn discuss and debate the ethics and future of
the ethical issues raised by xe among them privacy security and job displacement xe and how to teach them are something educators across the country are wrestling with and many professors and students say more needs to be done in classes xe not just in separate ethics courses xe to ensure students become workers who are thoughtful about the role of
xe cfor instance we think of self driving cars as years down the road but the way things are progressing it will be lot sooner xe said dillon pulliam who is studying for his master xe degree in electrical and computer engineering at carnegie mellon xe cwe need policies xe if the car hits pedestrian who is responsible xe
at the university of washington new class called xe cintelligent machinery identity and ethics xe is being taught this fall by team leader at google and the co director of the university xe computational neuroscience program
daniel grossman professor and deputy director of undergraduate studies at the university xe paul allen school of computer science and engineering explained the purpose this way
the course xe caims to get at the big ethical questions we xe ll be facing not just in the next year or two but in the next decade or two xe
david danks professor of philosophy and psychology at carnegie mellon just started teaching class xe ca society and humanity xe the class is an outgrowth of faculty coming together over the past three years to create shared research projects he said because students need to learn from both those who are trained in the technology and those who are trained in asking ethical questions
xe cthe key is to make sure they have the opportunities to really explore the ways technology can have an impact xe to think how this will affect people in poorer communities or how it can be abused xe he said

in what has now become somewhat of quadrennial exercise strategists and analysts from some of the world xe biggest banks have put their quantitative skills to use in order to predict the winner dealbook has reviewed the analysis xe which includes artificial intelligence statistical modeling portfolio theory and economic analysis xe from four different banks
here xe rundown on their predictions along with description of how they got to their results
its approach group from the swiss bank xe chief investment office scored each team based on an objective skill level measurement called elo rating its route through qualification and any home nation advantage the analysts then carried out statistical modeling known as monte carlo simulation which it explains like this
we draw large number of random variables and use these to bring in random component to our calculations and to simulate the championship better team is still more likely to win than its lower ranked opponent but this is sport and upsets do happen after we xe ve repeated this again and again we end up with the results of virtual tournaments we then simply count how many times each team won
the result germany brazil and spain are most likely to win xe with germany the ubs favorite with percent chance of victory
its approach goldman sachs xe global macro research team opted to use artificial intelligence algorithms to conduct its analysis here xe its approach
we feed data on team characteristics individual players and recent team performance into four different types of machine learning models to analyze the number of goals scored in each match the models then learn the relationship between these characteristics and goals scored using the scores of competitive world cup and european cup matches since by cycling through alternative combinations of variables we get sense of which characteristics matter for success and which stay on the bench we then use the model to predict the number of goals scored in each possible encounter of the tournament and use the unrounded score to determine the winner
the result an unnervingly algorithmic score in the final of goals for brazil to just for germany
bonus goldman has predicted brazilian victory for the last three world cups and has been wrong every time sadly paul the octopus is no longer alive to predict the results
its approach the dutch bank used one of the more unusual techniques described here opting to calculate the chances of success using measure based on market value of the nation xe team and its previous performance the assumption here being that value and success are closely correlated team xe worth was calculated from individual player transfer value estimates and their track record from fifa world rankings
the results spain will be crowned world champion with total team value of xe xac billion billion close second france which is valued at xe xac billion
its approach the japanese bank opted to treat the tournament with the same techniques it would use to offer balanced risk to investors
being analysts we have to apply some rigor to our world cup predictions so we xe ve decided to apply portfolio theory and the efficient markets hypothesis to the world cup we look at the value of players in each team the momentum of team performance and historical performance to arrive at three portfolios of teams to watch
the results its analysis suggests that france spain and brazil are the most likely to reach the semifinals and it predicts that france and spain will meet in the final
an earlier version of this article misstated the name of the trophy given to the winner of the world cup it is the fifa world cup trophy not the jules rimet trophy

mr malcomson is the author of xe csplinternet how geopolitics and commerce are fragmenting the world wide web xe
is silicon valley going to war in amazon beat ibm for contract to host the united states intelligence community xe data cloud microsoft now markets azure government secret its cloud computing service designed specifically for federal and local governments to the defense department and intelligence agencies and last year google signed contract with the pentagon for project maven pilot program to accelerate the military xe use of artificial intelligence
these partnerships might ease anxiety in the defense department about china xe artificial intelligence advances and ominous state led fusion of civil and military technology development but comparable fusion of the united states government and silicon valley would be mistake
this is not so much because it would compromise silicon valley values as more than google employees argued in recent letter about project maven to the company xe chief executive sundar pichai rather it xe because the united states xe edge in techno military competition exists in great part because we have tech sector that is not dominated by the state and its needs
narrowing the focus of the united states tech sector to the needs of the military would serve neither party on the contrary it would make the nation weaker
to be sure defense contracts are hardly new in silicon valley and google xe recent moves might be seen as heralding silicon valley xe return to its natural home in defense contracting but that would be to misunderstand both silicon valley history and today xe technology
the internet and much of digital computing did indeed emerge from decades of united states defense contracts beginning as long ago as world war yet the pentagon itself sloughed off the internet xe not knowing quite what to do with it and rightly judging it to be insecure xe to the national science foundation when the internet became commercial concern the national science foundation off loaded it to the department of commerce government might have given birth to the internet but it sure didn xe raise it
the emergence of civilian entrepreneurial tech culture in the owed as much intellectually if not at first financially to the antiwar movement and the counterculture xe hardly friends of the military industrial complex out of this the dominant highly creative ethos of geek antiauthoritarianism grew it is hard to believe that closer ties with the military would perpetuate this culture of innovation
the technology involved in projects like azure government secret and project maven is also very different from the data sharing projects of the those older technologies would not have been created in the absence of government funding today xe projects in contrast are all basically plays very little of this is defense specific but all of it is useful for defense and espionage unlike say weapons development research is inherently dual use united states tech giants would be pursuing it with or without government contracts silicon valley does not need the pentagon to initiate these endeavors
the pentagon is in different position it came around very reluctantly to the idea that it is dependent on private industry for the defense of the country and the projection of american power but come around it has in no small part thanks to china
china xe state interest in was initially economic but military uses were never far behind as elsa kania researcher at the center for new american security explained in an influential report xe ca is high level priority within china xe national agenda for military civil fusion xe strategy that should allow the chinese armed forces to benefit from private sector advances in
the united states military seems to have been spooked in memo the deputy secretary of defense robert work wrote that while the defense department had made xe ctentative steps xe in xe cwe need to do much more and move much faster xe the memo announced the formation of project maven to do just that this month gen stephen wilson the vice chief of staff for the air force said that china is taking xe cwhole of nation xe approach to and the united states should too
yet we shouldn xe forget that civil military antagonism and the deep american tradition of distrusting the state have been crucial to the united states xe ability to innovate there are good reasons why defense tech giants of the xe and xe like raytheon and grumman missed out on such major tech advances as web protocols the smartphone personal computers and various types of encryption xe all of which would eventually have great military significance the biggest reason was that none of these advances were directed at waging war indeed many aimed at transcending the power of the state
after the cold war the soviet union xe extraordinary technological capacity dissipated in large part because it had been so reactive the soviets had let their adversary determine the pace and scope of their own innovation the united states should not make that mistake

instagram said tuesday it was expanding its online anti bullying initiative adding new filter to weed out comments meant to harass or bully the million users of the popular social media site
the company said it would review accounts that have large number of comments filtered out if those accounts violate instagram xe community guidelines it will take action which could include banning them the new filter will also hide comments attacking person xe appearance or character and alert instagram to repeat offenders
it is the second step in an initiative announced last year to curb offensive comments and rid instagram of its most malicious members
xe cto be clear we don xe tolerate bullying on instagram xe kevin systrom the company xe chief executive and co founder told instagram users in blog post tuesday the company will also expand policies to guard against the bullying of young public figures who are often the target of hate filled messages
xe cprotecting our youngest community members is crucial to helping them feel comfortable to express who they are and what they care about xe he added
in study conducted by ditch the label an online anti bullying organization percent of respondents in the united kingdom said social media sites did not do enough to combat online bullying instagram was of particular note percent of more than people aged to surveyed in the united kingdom said they had experienced cyberbullying on the site in the previous months
in march the model and actress amber rose called out cyberbullies for saying her year old son was gay after she posted videos on instagram of him opening gift from the singer taylor swift
it is not only children who are targeted in november drew barrymore was attacked after she posed with starfish in photograph to promote new lipstick xe cit hurt me xe she wrote in follow up post which was liked times
instagram like other social media sites including twitter and youtube has become an easy place to shame or offend something the company acknowledged last year mr systrom addressed it in blog post then saying xe cmany of you have told us that toxic comments discourage you from enjoying instagram and expressing yourself freely xe
instagram is using machine learning algorithm to detect offenders called deeptext it was built by facebook which owns instagram and uses artificial intelligence to review words for context and meaning much as the human brain determines how words are used facebook is holding its annual developer conference this week initially instagram had team of people review and rate comments sorting them into different categories bullying racism or sexual harassment
xe cwhat we are concentrating on is building the tools so people can control their experience on instagram xe said karina newton head for public policy at instagram xe cthose will improve over time xe
instagram xe users are expected to follow the site xe guidelines which include being respectful to other community members and not posting photographs of naked bodies
the company has also embarked on xe ckindness xe campaign hosting events to promote inclusion and diversity xe cit xe been our goal to make it safe place for self expression and to foster kindness within the community xe mr systrom said xe cthis update is just the next step in our mission to deliver on that promise xe

some amazon shareholders are calling for the commerce giant to stop selling its facial recognition technology to the police
group of socially responsible investors including firms like sustainvest asset management and the social equity group are applying pressure to amazon over privacy concerns that they have about the technology
amazon began marketing facial recognition system called rekognition to law enforcement agencies as means of identifying suspects shortly after the tool was introduced in the system xe which analyzes images and video and compares them with databases of photographs to pick out individuals xe has been used by the police department in orlando fla and the sheriff xe department in washington county ore
but recently amazon came under criticism from the american civil liberties union and group of more than two dozen civil rights organizations for selling the technology to police authorities the xe argument the police could use such systems not just to track people committing crimes but also to identify citizens who are innocent such as protesters
now some amazon shareholders are joining those appeals in letter addressed to the company xe chief executive jeff bezos group of investors explained why they want halt to rekognition sales to the police
such government surveillance infrastructure technology may not only pose privacy threat to customers and other stakeholders across the country but may also raise substantial risks for our company negatively impacting our company xe stock valuation and increasing financial risk for shareholders
in addition to our concerns for consumers who may be put in harm xe way with law enforcement xe use of rekognition we are also concerned sales may be expanded to foreign governments including authoritarian regimes
amazon had no immediate comment on the letter
in blog post published shortly after the initial call by the to ban the sale of rekognition to the police matt wood general manager of artificial intelligence at amazon web services wrote
we believe it is the wrong approach to impose ban on promising new technologies because they might be used by bad actors for nefarious purposes in the future the world would be very different place if we had restricted people from buying computers because it was possible to use that computer to do harm the same can be said of thousands of technologies upon which we all rely each day through responsible use the benefits have far outweighed the risks
tech companies recently have come under scrutiny for their work with the government
in april google employees protested the company xe work on pentagon project that used image recognition to improve military drone operations they said the tech giant xe cshould not be in the business of war xe in response google said it would not renew the contract for that particular piece of work known as project maven and has since created set of principles to guide its artificial intelligence projects the new guidelines prohibit work that could cause injury or violate human rights xe but do not rule out all forms of defense work
microsoft has come under scrutiny for its involvement with united states immigration and customs enforcement which is itself part of broad criticism this week about the government xe separating families at the united states borders the software giant drew criticism for temporarily deleting january blog post that described how the company was xe cproud to support xe work with ice the agency was using microsoft xe azure cloud services to xe cutilize deep learning capabilities to accelerate facial recognition and identification xe
microsoft says that it has not been involved with projects relating to separation of families at borders
to be clear microsoft is not working with immigration and customs enforcement or customs and border protection on any projects related to separating children from their families at the border and contrary to some speculation we are not aware of azure or azure services being used for this purpose as company microsoft is dismayed by the forcible separation of children from their families at the border
it remains to be seen if amazon might bow to investor pressure and stop selling its software or whether microsoft might cease working with ice but the news certainly illustrates that relationships between technology companies and government entities have become serious cause for concern among many critics

decent memory is matter of livelihood of independence most of all of identity
human memory is the ghost in the neural machine widely distributed continually changing multidimensional conversation among cells that can reproduce both the capital of kentucky and the emotional catacombs of that first romance
the news last week that scientists had developed brain implant that boosts memory xe an implantable xe ccognitive prosthetic xe in the jargon xe should be astounding even to the cynical
app developers probably are already plotting yet another brain exercise product based on the latest science screenwriters working on their next amnesia assassin scripts got some real life backup for the pitch meeting
the scientists are in discussions to commercialize the technology and so people in the throes of serious memory loss and their families likely feel sense of hope thin though it may be these things take time and there are still many unknowns
but for those in the worried well demographic xe the is the new crowd and older xe reports of memory breakthrough fall into different category
what exactly does it mean that scientists are truly beginning to understand the biology of memory well enough to manipulate it which reaction is appropriate the futurist xe or the curmudgeon xe
the only honest answer at this stage is both
the developers of the new implant led by scientists at the university of pennsylvania and thomas jefferson university built on decades of work decoding brain signals using the most advanced techniques of machine learning
their implant in fact constitutes an array of electrodes embedded deep in the brain that monitor electrical activity and like pacemaker deliver stimulating pulse only when needed xe when the brain is lagging as it tries to store new information
when the brain is functioning well the apparatus remains quiet
xe cwe all have good days and bad days times when we xe re foggy or when we xe re sharp xe said michael kahana psychology professor at the university of pennsylvania and senior author of last week xe report
xe cwe found that jostling the system when it xe in low functioning state can jump it to high functioning one xe
if this system once refined one day provides support for people with extreme deficits it will sharply improve lives insurers willing the older person with creeping dementia will have more years living independently the veteran with traumatic brain injury may regain just enough sharpness to find decent job or career
for most everyone else the central discovery behind the device xe that goosing wandering brain can make it somewhat sharper xe is already deeply familiar human beings have been doing this deliberately and forever with caffeine nicotine prescription drugs like ritalin or more virtuously with brisk run around the park
xe cwe have good evidence that things like nicotine and aerobic exercise improve some aspects of attention xe said zach hambrick professor of psychology at michigan state university xe cthe stimulation may be activating some of the same systems only more directly and precisely xe
one such ability that people with extraordinarily precise memory have in common is known as selective attention or xe cattentional control xe in common measure of this the stroop test people see words flash on computer screen and name the color in which word is presented
answering is nearly instantaneous when the color and the word are the same xe xe cblue xe displayed in blue xe but slower when there xe no match like xe cblue xe displayed in red the men and women who compete in memory competitions score very highly on such tests and often do so well into their thirties when the ability is typically on the wane
this skill is partly inherited but psychologists have shown that just about anyone can stretch his or her native ability using the same technique that the memory champs do mentally arranging new names facts or words in deeply familiar place xe along subway stops for example or in childhood room
in one continuing study researchers at washington university in st louis trained group of older adult volunteers to memorize word lists using location imagery xe so called memory palace
xe cone woman in her sixties got to where she could recall more than words in correct order xe said david balota who collaborated on the study xe cothers were well up to fifty and sixty words xe
and all without surgery or ritalin
but there was catch xe cthat ability didn xe transfer to any improvement in general cognition like the ability to concentrate to store new information without using the technique or speed of processing xe dr balota said
in short ramping up the ability to recall lists of facts whether with use of an electric brain implant or imagery based training may mean nothing for overall quality of life in people whose memories are functioning normally
it is in those with serious deficits that the equation changes
device that even partly corrects those injuries might keep crucial details xe whom to call for help how to use the phone even navigating back and forth to the bathroom xe firmly lodged in mind for now that is where brain implant is most relevant
in the years to come scientists are likely to turn this new technology to the task of memory retrieval rather than just storage
xe cwe find there xe even more variability during retrieval than encoding xe dr kahana said xe meaning more potential to ramp up performance when that happens the game changes
giving people with serious deficits way to master the crucial facets of daily existence would certainly be medical advance
but giving them and others more vivid and deeper reach into the vast pool of what they already know xe well there are angels and demons buried there in addition to facts and names
that will be real life screenplay we should all watch carefully

now jana partners and pension giant calstrs are pushing apple to do more to protect its youngest users from the effects of digital technology

in august researchers from the allen institute for artificial intelligence lab based in seattle unveiled an english test for computers it examined whether machines could complete sentences like this one
on stage woman takes seat at the piano she
sits on bench as her sister plays with the doll
smiles with someone as the music plays
is in the crowd watching the dancers
nervously sets her fingers on the keys
for you that would be an easy question but for computer it was pretty hard while humans answered more than percent of the test questions correctly the lab xe systems hovered around percent among experts xe those who know just how difficult it is to build systems that understand natural language xe that was an impressive number
then two months later team of google researchers unveiled system called bert its improved technology answered those questions just as well as humans did xe and it was not even designed to take the test
bert xe arrival punctuated significant development in artificial intelligence over the last several months researchers have shown that computer systems can learn the vagaries of language in general ways and then apply what they have learned to variety of specific tasks
built in quick succession by several independent research organizations including google and the allen institute these systems could improve technology as diverse as digital assistants like alexa and google home as well as software that automatically analyzes documents inside law firms hospitals banks and other businesses
xe ceach time we build new ways of doing something close to human level it allows us to automate or augment human labor xe said jeremy howard the founder of fast ai an independent lab based in san francisco that is among those at the forefront of this research xe cthis can make life easier for lawyer or paralegal but it can also help with medicine xe
it may even lead to technology that can xe finally xe carry on decent conversation
but there is downside on social media services like twitter this new research could also lead to more convincing bots designed to fool us into thinking they are human mr howard said
researchers have already shown that rapidly improving techniques can facilitate the creation of fake images that look real as these kinds of technologies move into the language field as well mr howard said we may need to be more skeptical than ever about what we encounter online
these new language systems learn by analyzing millions of sentences written by humans system built by openai lab based in san francisco analyzed thousands of self published books including romance novels science fiction and more google xe bert analyzed these same books plus the length and breadth of wikipedia
each system learned particular skill by analyzing all that text openai xe technology learned to guess the next word in sentence bert learned to guess missing words anywhere in sentence but in mastering these specific tasks they also learned about how language is pieced together
if bert can guess the missing words in millions of sentences such as xe cthe man walked into store and bought of milk xe it can also understand many of the fundamental relationships between words in the english language said jacob devlin the google researcher who oversaw the creation of bert bert is short for bidirectional encoder representations from transformers
the system can apply this knowledge to other tasks if researchers provide bert with bunch of questions and their answers it learns to answer other questions on its own then if they feed it news headlines that describe the same event it learns to recognize when two sentences are similar usually machines can recognize only an exact match
bert can handle the xe ccommon sense xe test from the allen institute it can also handle reading comprehension test where it answers questions about encyclopedia articles what is oxygen what is precipitation in another test it can judge the sentiment of movie review is the review positive or negative
this kind of technology is xe ca step toward lot of still faraway goals in like technologies that can summarize and synthesize big messy collections of information to help people make important decisions xe said sam bowman professor at new york university who specializes in natural language research
in the weeks after the release of openai xe system outside researchers applied it to conversation an independent group of researchers used openai xe technology to create system that leads competition to build the best chatbot that was organized by several top labs including the facebook ai lab and this month google xe open sourced xe its bert system so others can apply it to additional tasks mr devlin and his colleagues have already trained it in languages
sebastian ruder researcher based in ireland who collaborates with fast ai sees the arrival of systems like bert as xe cwake up call xe for him and other researchers because they had assumed language technology had hit ceiling xe cthere is so much untapped potential xe he said
the complex mathematical systems behind this technology are called neural networks in recent years this type of machine learning has accelerated progress in subjects as varied as face recognition technology and driverless cars researchers call this xe cdeep learning xe
bert succeeded in part because it leaned on enormous amounts of computer processing power that was not available to neural networks in years past it analyzed all those wikipedia articles over the course of several days using dozens of computer processors built by google specifically for training neural networks
the ideas that drive bert have been around for years but they started to work because modern hardware could juggle much larger amounts of data mr devlin said
like google dozens of other companies are now building chips specifically for this kind of machine learning and many believe the influx of this extra processing power will continue to accelerate the progress of wide range of technologies including most notably natural language applications
xe cbert is first thrust in that direction xe said jeff dean who oversees google xe artificial intelligence work xe cbut actually not all that big in terms of where we want to go xe mr dean believes that ever larger amounts of processing power will lead to machines that can better juggle natural language
but there is reason for skepticism that this technology can keep improving quickly because researchers tend to focus on the tasks they can make progress on and avoid the ones they can xe said gary marcus new york university psychology professor who has long questioned the effectiveness of neural networks xe cthese systems are still really long way from truly understanding running prose xe he said
oren etzioni chief executive of the allen institute for artificial intelligence another prominent voice who has pushed for research that extends beyond neural networks made the same point
though bert passed the lab xe common sense test he said machines are still long way from an artificial version of human xe common sense but like other researchers in this field he believes the trajectory of natural language research has changed this is moment of xe cexplosive progress xe he said

the telecom giant verizon said on friday that it was installing its head of technology as chief executive the changing of the guard comes at time when the wireless industry as whole is grappling with new technologies and wave of consolidation
in statement verizon said that lowell mcadam the current chief executive was retiring and that hans vestberg the chief technology officer will succeed him on aug
the choice of mr vestberg who has overseen the deployment of next generation mobile services underscores the importance verizon places on that technology which will greatly increase download speeds and lay the wireless foundation for self driving cars and smart appliances
xe ci am humbled to be appointed of verizon at such an exciting and dynamic time for our company and industry xe mr vestberg said in the statement xe cwe are experiencing unprecedented changes in the way users interact in the digital world and we are racing ahead to remain at the forefront of technology connectivity and mobility xe
mr vestberg is relative newcomer to verizon he joined the company in april from ericsson where he worked for years the last six as chief executive he was ousted from the stockholm based telecommunications company in amid criticism that he had not been aggressive enough in cutting costs and that he lacked strategic focus
mr mcadam who served six years in the navy xe civil engineer corps before embarking on his career became verizon xe chief executive in august during his tenure he took big steps to prepare the company for the industry xe current upheaval in that time verizon xe share price has increased nearly percent to
after leaving his post on aug mr mcadam will continue as verizon xe executive chairman until he retires at the end of the year the company said
his legacy includes deal that was years in the making xe the purchase of vodafone xe stake in verizon xe wireless business for billion the transaction gave mr mcadam and his team more control over the company xe main business at crucial time
he also changed the identity of verizon making it more than just provider of phone and internet services when he steered it into the business of digital content buying aol and yahoo for more than billion
in addition mr mcadam put together billion deal for straight path telecommunications company specializing in the network airwaves carrying data and he led the purchase of fleetmatics an irish company that helps large corporations manage employees on the road for billion
on mr mcadam xe watch the company also flirted with old school media and entertainment companies having briefly considered buying the assets of st century fox before the walt disney company ended up agreeing to acquire them in billion deal verizon also expressed interest in the cbs corporation according to lawsuit filed last month by cbs against its controlling shareholder shari redstone
while visiting the new york stock exchange last month however mr mcadam sent strong signal that the company would focus on making technology reality and would not pursue takeovers of the traditional content companies
xe cwe xe ve looked at that over the years and we made our decision to go digital xe he said in an interview with cnbc xe cthat xe why we bought aol and yahoo and we talk now about superchannels of sports and finance and news and some entertainment xe
verizon xe appointment of its chief technology officer to the top spot suggests that the focus on infrastructure will drive the company xe strategy in the years to come interestingly though mr vestberg unlike the executive he is set to replace is not an engineer
the incoming chief executive is new kind of figure for verizon unlike the three previous chief executives xe mr mcadam ivan seidenberg and charles lee xe who have run verizon since it came into the world upon the merger of bell atlantic and gte in mr vestberg was not born in the united states native of hudiksvall sweden small city along the hudiksvallsfjarden bay he speaks english portuguese and spanish in addition to his native tongue and is skiing and handball enthusiast
mr vestberg began his career in the travel expenses department of ericsson soon after earning degree in business administration at the university of uppsala during two decades he worked his way up at the company and was mentored by its chief executive carl henric svanberg who is now the top executive at bp and volvo in mr vestberg replaced his boss becoming the first chief executive in ericsson xe long history without an engineering background in recent years he has served as the president of the swedish handball federation and the chairman of the swedish olympic committee
verizon public relations executive bob varettoni noted the change in nationality of verizon xe leadership with jaunty twitter post on friday it included photograph taken from the verizon boardroom in midtown manhattan of huge billboard advertising swedish brand yupik parka
mr vestberg will oversee company of more than employees as it navigates an industry undergoing rapid change with consumers all over the world flocking to wireless devices and online media the shift has persuaded the industry xe major players to pursue deals to become ever larger and in some cases more diverse in their offerings
sprint and mobile which are in the midst of planned merger contend that building network requires tens of billions of dollars in investments that only an enormous corporation can afford to spare
verizon xe main rival at amp in its quest for scale has followed different path bidding billion for time warner the justice department xe itself trying to define the rules for an industry in flux xe has challenged the deal on antitrust grounds with federal judge expected to rule on tuesday
other verizon competitors have been offering more of everything comcast for example has lured hundreds of thousands of new customers to its mobile phone service by bundling it with cable television plans in second line of attack it has made itself surprise player for the purchase of the fox assets xe potential deal that would require bid bold enough to upend fox xe agreement with disney
despite verizon xe recent feints toward old line companies mr mcadam largely stuck to strategy of improving the company xe network xe it regularly receives industry accolades for its performance and reach xe and leading the quest for the industry xe latest holy grail
last month mr mcadam told cnbc that verizon would roll out in four cities xe starting with los angeles and sacramento xe by the end of

the bosses haven xe yet introduced facial recognition technology at the royal hawaiian hotel but from her perch behind the front desk at the pink neo moorish palace overlooking waikiki beach jean te xe gibney can see it coming
xe cmarriott just rolled it out in china xe enabling guests to check into their rooms without bothering with front desk formalities said ms te xe gibney year old grandmother of seven xe cit seems they know they will be eliminating our jobs xe
similar fears simmer throughout marriott xe vast network of hotels the largest in the united states over the last two weeks ms te xe gibney and thousands of other marriott workers xe cooks and cashiers bellhops and housekeepers xe have voted to authorize their union unite here to strike at dozens of locations from waikiki to boston and san diego to detroit
alongside the usual demands for higher wages and better workplace safety the union is bringing another issue to the table asking for procedures to protect workers affected by new technologies and the innovations they spur
xe cyou are not going to stop technology xe said unite here xe president taylor xe cthe question is whether workers will be partners in its deployment or bystanders that get run over by it xe
unlike manufacturing workers whose jobs have been lost to automation since as far back as the workers in the low wage portion of the service sector had remained until now largely shielded from job killing technologies
many earned too little to justify large capital costs to replace them typical hotel or motel desk clerk earns just over an hour according to government data concierge just over and many of the tasks they perform seemed too challenging to automate technology is changing this calculus
there is no equivalent measure on the penetration of software systems like alexa or touch screens in the workplace but in automakers in the united states had robots for every workers according to research by the economists daron acemoglu of the massachusetts institute of technology and pascual restrepo of boston university in service businesses there were virtually none
but with advances in machine learning and other innovations in information technology many service jobs are now potentially in jeopardy compared with manufacturing the investment needed to automate some tasks in the hotel sector xe like front desk or concierge services xe is likely to be relatively low
maria mendiola concierge at the san jose marriott frets that amazon xe agreement to deploy its echo device in hotel rooms across marriott xe properties will eventually make her position pointless xe calexa might do my job in the future xe she said
at the sheraton waikiki next to the royal hawaiian cashiers at the beachside lounge worry about newly deployed computer system that will allow servers to close out their own checks xe making cashiers redundant
there are automatic dishwashers on the market machines to flip burgers and mix cocktails robots to deliver room service or help guests book restaurant reservation
new technologies are reconfiguring the workplace in other ways doormen are losing tips as guests turn to uber and lyft instead of regular taxis so are bellhops when guests use seamless food delivery app instead of room service
how many jobs will technology take out hoteliers have yet to figure out how guests will react to more tech heavy experience marriott spokeswoman said in statement that the chain was not deploying technology to eliminate jobs but was xe cpersonalizing the guest experience and enhancing the stay xe
cliff atkinson senior vice president for hospitality at mgm resorts said new technologies had changed job descriptions at properties across his chain but had not eliminated jobs front desk clerks displaced by automated check in kiosks are deployed as xe clobby ambassadors xe or concierges
still history suggests that the most powerful motivation to deploy new technologies has been the opportunity to reduce labor costs from to professors acemoglu and restrepo estimated each new robot cut jobs and reduced wages by percent
as technology gets better and cheaper there are lots of new tasks it could take over xe cit is new uncharted area for our company and our industry as whole xe mr atkinson said xe cwe have talked about one or two brands being fully automated and self service for the guest xe
david autor an economist at says it is plausible to foresee future in which xe as airlines have done xe hotels deploy humans to tend to elite guests and automated systems for everybody else workers generate costs well beyond their hourly wage professor autor argued they get sick and take vacations and require managers xe cpeople are messy xe he noted xe cmachines are straightforward xe
last year the mckinsey global institute issued report projecting that technology would drive percent decline in jobs in food service and lodging from to that xe almost on par with the percent decline in manufacturing jobs from to
unions would rather not have manufacturing xe story repeat itself in the service sector xe cwe are trying to get ahead of that xe said anand singh president of unite here xe local in san francisco xe cwe are not luddites but we are seeking real voice at table xe
the international brotherhood of teamsters is also worried about technologies hurtling into the present as it squared off for contract negotiations with united parcel service this year the union put bold proposition on the table to prohibit using drones or autonomous vehicles to deliver packages but in september when the union sent the agreement to members for ratification vote there was no such provision
edward wytkind who until this year headed the transportation trades department of the said unions could not stop technology if they tried xe cmaybe you can stop it through one round of bargaining or slow it down xe he said xe cbut innovation has been going on for years and has never stopped xe
and he noted what might be the cost of success xe care we winning future for workers not if the company goes out of business xe
better strategy might be to demand say in how technology is deployed
the teamsters xe tentative deal with for instance calls for six months of advance warning to the union of technological deployments and for the creation of committee with union and company representatives that would negotiate xe cregarding the effects of the proposed technological changes xe
unite here is following similar path mr singh listed the union xe goals for marriott contracts xe cwe want to talk about how technology can assist the work we perform and ease the rigors of our work how our members are trained what happens to workers who would otherwise be tagged as redundant how our members are repositioned to succeed or hired into other workplaces xe
in june the union managed for the first time to include protections from technological change in its contracts covering workers at the las vegas properties of mgm resorts and caesars entertainment workers will be trained to do jobs created or modified by new technology allowing them to share in the productivity gains the contracts also provide for the company to try to find jobs for displaced workers but the union xe key achievement was to get days xe warning of technological deployments
xe cthey have to let us know and show us the prototypes and must negotiate with us xe mr taylor said xe cat the end of the day they can move forward but this gives us time to understand the effects xe
if they could choose precedent from american labor history today xe union leaders might follow the path of the international longshore and warehouse union
in the and xe dockworkers were walloped by one of the most revolutionary technical innovations of the th century containers at stroke containers slashed both the time and number of workers needed to load ship saving vast amounts of money
instead of trying to stop the big boxes the union covering the longshoremen on the west coast demanded share of the spoils rich retirement packages for workers who were let go and hefty remuneration for those who stayed as result longshoremen working full time year round now make to year on average
but you need lot of power to get deal like that the longshore union could shut down ports at will imposing huge costs on shippers for workers lacking that kind of clout the gains achieved by the longshoremen seem out of reach
unite here is not powerless nationwide only percent of workers in the accommodation industry are unionized according to government statistics but in san francisco for instance unite here represents percent of workers at class hotels that xe partly why housekeepers in san francisco make an hour the union notes more than double the national median of
unite here xe victories so far have been hard won xe cit was not an easy ask xe mr taylor said of the language on technology in the las vegas deals xe cit does infringe on hotels xe right to do what they want xe
the outcome might or might not deliver greater share of the gains from technology to workers but front desk clerks and concierges will have better options than severance when alexa or computer software takes over some of their tasks xe cit was good resolution xe mr taylor said xe ctime will tell if it is good enough xe

london xe after months investigating facebook and online misinformation british parliamentary committee issued scathing report on monday accusing the company of breaking data privacy and competition laws and calling for new regulations to rein in the technology industry
repeated scandals involving facebook and other tech companies demand more government oversight the committee concluded including laws making internet companies legally liable for content shared on their websites
xe cthe era of self regulation for tech companies should come to an end xe said damian collins the chairman of the digital culture media and sport committee which published the report
the conclusions in britain add to momentum globally for new regulations against the technology sector europe has been the most aggressive in taking on silicon valley but tougher approach is gaining ground in the united states where the federal trade commission is considering imposing multibillion dollar fine against facebook and lawmakers have called for new data privacy regulations
the parliamentary report recommends the creation of british watchdog to oversee the technology industry similar to the country xe approach to regulating media companies it also suggested legally requiring facebook and other large internet platforms to remove what the government determines to be harmful content or risk fines or other punishments
silicon valley has long opposed making tech companies responsible for content on their sites the industry argues that websites like facebook youtube and twitter are simply unbiased platforms for others to share material and that new restrictions could impede free speech
xe csocial media companies cannot hide behind the claim of being merely xe platform xe and maintain that they have no responsibility themselves in regulating the content of their sites xe the parliamentary report said
facebook acknowledged past mistakes and said it was open to xe cmeaningful regulation xe
xe cwhile we still have more to do we are not the same company we were year ago xe said karim palant public policy manager for facebook in britain xe cwe have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to people and invested heavily in machine learning artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse xe
the blistering report concludes the committee xe work which started as study of how social media can be manipulated to influence elections like britain xe vote to exit the european union but became closer examination of facebook xe business practices the committee held several hearings related to facebook xe relationship with cambridge analytica the voter targeting firm that gained access to million facebook users
the committee does not have lawmaking authority on its own but mr collins said in an interview that he hoped the recommendations would be incorporated into broader review of technology regulation underway within the british government policymakers are debating new rules to prevent online election meddling and the spread of hate speech and terrorist content
british parliamentary committee would not typically cause much worry for company of facebook xe size but the panel became persistent challenge for the social media company
mr collins has threatened to force facebook xe chief executive mark zuckerberg to testify if he ever travels to britain in december the committee released trove of secret internal emails in which mr zuckerberg and other facebook executives discussed sharing access to user data with certain companies like netflix and airbnb while cutting off others
the committee said the emails showed facebook xe willingness to sacrifice user privacy to maximize revenue and generate more money from advertising without new oversight technology companies cannot be expected to change the report concluded
xe cthe big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially without constraint or proper regulatory oversight xe the report said xe cbut only governments and the law are powerful enough to contain them xe

london xe it xe just after in los angeles and oumarou idrissa is awake he opens his uber app and in london curtain opens
at the victoria and albert museum here mr idrissa xe sleep and app use habits are on display in collaborative piece he created with the artist miranda july called xe ci xe the president baby xe mr idrissa is los angeles based uber driver who came to the united states from niger he suffers from persistent insomnia the work charts his sleep habits and his use of the apps whatsapp uber and instagram in real time for viewers in london each of the four curtains is linked to specific action when mr idrissa wakes up or opens an app set of curtains open when he closes an app or goes to sleep another set closes
the piece is part of the show xe cthe future starts here xe running through nov the show assembles objects xe some prototypes of advanced technology some so familiar they may seem old fashioned xe and artworks that serve as starting points for imagining possible futures and examining the complexities of modern life
sit down at table for one with bottle of the meal replacement drink soylent in recreation of dutch restaurant for solo diners marvel at the models of planned floating cities or year old xe vision of rebuilt aleppo pick up book from library curated for the end of civilization and read
alongside these there are works of art like ms july and mr idrissa xe xe ci xe the president baby xe is lens into issues of migration app based communication the gig economy surveillance social media and privacy xe all that from four sets of elegant curtains opening and closing on museum wall
ms july first met mr idrissa when he was her uber driver in los angeles in she was on the way to interview the pop star rihanna for profile in the new york times style magazine they got to talking eventually about his trouble sleeping
mr idrissa said his insomnia started in about he came to the united states on student visa which expired xe ci was supposed to be deported and they sent me letter xe mr idrissa said in recent interview he said that one day the immigration authorities xe ccame to my door at or in the morning and the lady there wouldn xe let them in so there were three or four years of just hiding and sleep only couple hours night xe now mr idrissa is citizen of the united states but the insomnia hasn xe left he says he often spends hours awake on his bed scrolling through apps
xe ci remember told him about the trauma of the birth of my child xe ms july said xe ci had this rough rough birth and was really quite sad we were both talking about trauma that wasn xe really leaving our bodies xe she said the conversation stayed with her and that when she was commissioned to make work for the victoria and albert show she thought of mr idrissa he agreed to work on it with her despite ms july xe initial concern that the project was too invasive
xe cit xe making something into civilized object that xe also kind of distressing feeling potentially or at least unsettling xe ms july said
many of the objects and artworks in the xe cthe future starts here xe could be described that way the show is sprawling overwhelming awash with screen light the half familiar automated sounds of siri and alexa xe voices pulsate on repeat in parts of the gallery along with the buzz of futuristic music the exhibition itself is beautifully housed and designed in bright neon and pastel colors it xe divided into four thematic areas xe self public planet and afterlife xe though these arenas feel porous
some objects in the show may be familiar to us even quotidian depending how plugged in we are alexa the iphone nest thermostat others we might have read about online xe robotic stuffed seal that can cuddle you to sleep robot named brett that can fold laundry slowly prototype of self driving car that talks to passengers while it drives other objects may be entirely disconnected from our daily realities cryopreservation unit for instance coffin like pod that can store recently deceased people xe bodies in liquid nitrogen at degrees one day some believe technology will exist that can reawaken them from death
the exhibition xe co curator rory hyde said that he wasn xe sure the museum could have done the show five years ago when digitization seemed to sound the death knell for physical objects
xe cbut objects are relevant again xe he said xe cwhen you think about the self driving car or facebook xe aircraft even the tech companies are moving back into physical engineering xe
mariana pestana the show xe other co curator said xe cobjects have this incredible capacity to embody visions we think of these objects as beginnings that open up set of possibilities xe
to walk into the show is to be confronted by big questions in all caps text xe cwhat makes us human xe xe cis edward snowden hero or traitor xe xe cwe are all connected but do we feel lonely xe the wall text explores nightmare scenarios and seeks to maintain optimism often at the same time the questions present an alternative to tech evangelism and extreme pessimism but sometimes as framing device they can feel didactic
the effect though is to make us realize how little we know the answers to these questions and how uncertain we are about what the world will look like in five years much less the objects succeed in imbuing their own wonder and terror
there are some historical objects in the show as well xe an early home telephone and celestial globe from around xe that allow viewers to consider just how much and how rapidly society and the objects in it have changed scarf that reads xe cvotes for women xe reminds us that is the centennial of women xe right to vote in britain
xe cwe xe re now at the centenary of the first women xe vote in the xe ms pestana said xe ca hundred years ago this idea that women could vote was radical idea and not plausible future nowadays it xe something of the norm at least in the west so we wanted to use this object to consider that some of the ideas in the show even if they seem radical and implausible maybe they xe re not maybe they can be the future xe
perhaps the most moving parts of the show are the artistic works like ms july and mr idrissa xe that respond in some way to the too much ness of contemporary and future life they xe re interspersed throughout the show among the objects themselves
there are two of the well known chelsea manning portraits by heather dewey hagborg which the artist reconstructed using samples of ms manning xe dna and printer while ms manning was in prison there xe also pair of photographs taken by hanif shoaei that document couples in bed in one they sit apart their faces aglow with light of their phone screens the scene is both otherworldly and familiar
almost easy to miss tucked next to splashy flier that reads xe ccampaign to stop killer robots xe is stuffed panda you might walk right past it or take it for another version of the cuddle you to sleep robot seal
it xe actually part of ai weiwei and jacob appelbaum xe work xe cpanda to panda xe the panda is stuffed with shredded government documents and memory card containing information leaked by the former national security agency contractor edward snowden series of these pandas were sent to dissidents around the world creating what mr appelbaum called xe cdistributed backup xe of the politically sensitive documents they had published xe cpanda to panda xe is also an art piece about subverting state power surveillance and secrets this particular panda the wall text notes is on loan from julian assange
xe cthe safest place to put these things is in museum gallery where it xe protected as an object xe mr appelbaum said in video about the piece
and there it sits an object among the other objects xe simultaneously piece of art thing part of history and harbinger of possible futures

the term xe cexpense report xe almost universally makes many people cringe it evokes feelings of anxiety frustration and time wasting grunt work managers seldom relish monitoring employees xe spending or reviewing every cab ride and few workers enjoy keeping track of charges itemizing costs or being forced to explain why they had to book plane ticket that cost more than their company allows lost receipt don xe even bother
advances in artificial intelligence however are rapidly improving the processes surrounding expense management and as humans and models work together toward greater efficiencies expense reports could soon evoke an entirely different emotion relief

when applied to expense management machine learning can accurately evaluate reports by observing patterns in what human reviewers approve or reject over time xe cyou could think of it like an apprenticeship xe says thomas malone founding director of the mit center for collective intelligence xe csometimes the apprentice may ask some explicit questions or the expert may make an explicit comment but the apprentice learns lot just by watching call it cyber human learning loop xe
already with enhanced tools expense reports are far less burdensome than they were even five years ago employees can now scan and upload receipts with their phones and their travel information is pulled into reports from booking sites corporate cards and email messages managers can review reports by mobile device then approve them with one button click but as humans continue to work with machine learning over the next year or two expense management systems will advance at an even faster pace xe and transform how we do business
xe cby the end of we will start seeing the automatic creation of full expense reports xe says lambert senior vice president of product management at sap concur machine learning algorithms will draw from myriad external data sources to quickly fill in missing details such as vendor location and expense type
xe cif an employee takes picture of receipt or uses corporate card that data can be automatically assembled into an expense report xe lambert says xe cit could even be submitted on behalf of the employee if they choose xe as humans and work jointly employees will likely be reimbursed faster and finance managers will benefit from near real time logs of expenditures
to help enhance the process expense management systems will soon apply algorithms to bypass year old optical character recognition tools says tim macdonald chief product officer for sap concur this technology can actually read handwritten receipts which accounts for to percent of all receipts and cannot be read by traditional ocr xe cwe xe re excited because it xe incredibly accurate xe macdonald says xe cyou take picture and bam it can tell you exactly what was captured xe
using to learn from human actions new business tools will seamlessly complement our lives employees could get instant feedback about their company xe travel policy on the platforms they use naturally xe bot could pop up for example to alert them if they are trying to book hotel room that exceeds what company policy allows xe cit becomes more of dialogue xe lambert says

concur labs research and development arm of sap concur that designs and tests prototypes is currently beta testing an expense bot developed for the group messaging service slack that lets users upload receipts add to expense reports and check on corporate expense policies without leaving the app also in the works an alexa add on that functions like travel booking assistant an apple watch add on that sends expenses to reports via verbal command and smartphone app that pulls mileage from car xe odometer into an expense report
all this automation greatly diminishes the sea of user errors employees once generated by manually typing expenses into spreadsheet says john dietz vice president of concur labs the concur detect auditing tool in fact can reduce expense reporting errors by up to percent xe cfrom an administrative point of view xe dietz says xe cthis technology is reducing network load xe
automating expenses is smart move for businesses xe cnot only do you free the manager from the drudgery of having to approve the expense report you actually get much better results for the company xe lambert says
sixty two percent of accounts payable costs stems from labor according to recent report by the american productivity and quality center xe cwith machine learning we xe re approaching period where you bring the human into the process only when you need to xe lambert says xe cas opposed to making that person review everything xe
managers can stay as involved as they want for instance supervisor wondering whether the department has the budget to send an employee to particular conference may confer with bot that pulls conference costs and quarterly spend predictions to expedite decision with real time reporting and faster reimbursements employees will likely be more content and financial decision makers will have increased control and knowledge
free from the burden of creating and approving expense reports companies can focus on propelling their businesses forward case in point cardinal health global healthcare organization that processes expense reports in an array of languages every month since automating its process in the company has reduced the hours its employees spend on expense reports by more than percent
xe cthe human hours we xe re saving could be upward of per month xe says debbie reinhart senior analyst in financial operations at cardinal health xe cwe xe re putting time back in our employees xe hands that xe our home run story xe
much of the machine learning technology necessary to completely automate expense reporting already exists xe cone of the biggest obstacles for based expense reports may be the need to change corporate policies and procedures to take advantage of these technological capabilities xe says malone who is the author of xe csuperminds the surprising power of people and computers thinking together xe
for some people the idea of artificial intelligence can sound threatening should humans be worried about losing jobs to robots xe cmachines will certainly do some of the tasks in the future that people do today xe malone says xe cbut it is extremely unlikely that this will lead to long term unemployment it has never happened with any of the past generations of automation xe
mckinsey amp company report backs malone xe assertion although automation will affect percent of current jobs the report predicts robots will subsume less than percent of these positions xe cwhen machines can do the routine things that people do today we xe ll find new things that people and computers can do together xe malone says xe cthose areas will provide new kinds of value and create new jobs xe
in today xe tech centric business environment adoption rates can suddenly accelerate xe cwe expect that many companies will transition to expense reporting within the next five to years because it xe so efficient xe lambert says xe csap concur is experienced in partnering with businesses to help them adapt to these rapidly changing times xe
when machine learning is utilized to its full potential malone says expense reports will essentially become invisible xe cpeople involved will rarely even think about them xe and what was once collective nightmare will quickly fade away into blurry past

aviation regulators will testify before senate subcommittees today on the crashes of two boeing max jets while boeing meets with airline executives to update them on fix for the software thought to be responsible for the accidents
the xe acting chief will defend the agency xe practice of delegating some plane safety checks to boeing as xe ccritical xe to the success of the certification process the official daniel elwell will argue that the process for the max was xe cdetailed and thorough xe
senators are expected to ask about long running doubts about the process the nyt reports that employees and transportation department watchdog worried over the years that the agency had xe ctoo close relationship xe with boeing officials lawmakers will also ask why an update to the jet xe anti stall software is still not ready
boeing xe response to the crisis is also being questioned particularly since its dennis muilenburg has largely remained silent xe ctheir comments have been very engineering esque xe richard levick communications expert told the nyt the company xe public response has become more assertive since hiring the crisis communications firm sard verbinnen
the company will meet today with pilots and airline representatives at the factory where the max is made it xe expected to offer some updates on the anti stall software

the european parliament voted yesterday to pass new copyright law requiring technology platforms to sign licensing agreements with musicians authors and news publishers in order to post their work online adam satariano of the nyt reports
xe cthe new law is meant to force tech firms to aggressively remove unlicensed copyrighted material from their websites proactively rather than waiting for complaints to come in before acting xe mr satariano writes
the policy is deeply divisive digital rights activists and the tech industry say it could result in censorship media organizations say it should protect europe xe creative industries and ensure companies pay for content they share online
some digital business models could be affected because website owners will take on more responsibility for what ends up on their platforms sites may find the law too expensive or cumbersome to police even google shuttered its news service which would require licenses from publishers under the new rules when similar initiative was introduced in spain
smaller organizations may be hit hardest these websites contend that giant tech platforms already have the resources to comply with the law mr satariano writes

as at least patent fights between apple and qualcomm trickle through courts around the world both companies scored victories yesterday the wsj reports
some iphones now face import ban after an international trade commission judge issued an initial ruling yesterday finding that apple had infringed qualcomm patent
but apple scored bigger victory when another judge ruled that the phone maker had not infringed qualcomm patent relating to power efficiency in mobile phones that overturned previous court finding
xe cqualcomm is hoping victory particularly an import ban could give it greater leverage in technology licensing negotiations xe bloomberg explains xe cqualcomm says it xe due billions of dollars in unpaid royalties on the iphone xe
xe capple denied infringing any of the patents in the two cases and claimed qualcomm is trying to shut its only based competitor out of the market something apple argues will hinder the development of the fifth generation of mobile communications xe bloomberg adds
corporate america set record for stock repurchases last year even as lawmakers proposed curtailing the practice
companies bought back billion worth of their own shares according to amp dow jones indices with billion of that coming in the fourth quarter alone the previous high was billion set in
the biggest buyer was apple which repurchased billion of its stock
the buyback boom was fueled by the trump tax cuts with companies preferring to use their savings to repurchase shares and bolster their stock prices rather than issue dividends or make new investments
and it came despite opposition from congress with lawmakers from senator bernie sanders to senator marco rubio arguing in favor of limits on the practice
but repeat is unlikely this year as the sugar rush from the tax cuts wears off

machine learning has spooky side these algorithmically generated halloween costumes show how artificial intelligence can reinforce human bias
when it comes to machine learning things can get little spooky we know an algorithm can solve problem but we often don xe know exactly how
today xe machine learning algorithms are considered form of artificial intelligence but it xe more helpful to think of them as prediction algorithms based on movies that this customer has rated highly how much do we think he will like this other movie based on people we have hired in the past how likely are we to hire this job candidate based on list of past halloween costumes what might humans dress up as this year
hoping to find an answer to that last question we turned to machine learning algorithm called textgenrnn that can learn to imitate text its author max woolf designed it as blank slate ready to learn any kind of text the text we gave it to imitate was list of costumes that people sent to aiweirdness com over year here are some examples of what that algorithm produced
zombie schoolgirl
toaster boy
donald mcdonald
zombie schoolgirl
donald mcdonald
toaster boy
the algorithm learned to spell all of these words and phrases without human intervention just by looking at the costume examples we gave it it starts by making predictions about which letters should be used in which order to make halloween costume and then it checks its own predictions by looking at the data used to train it if it xe wrong and at first it almost always is it refines its internal structure gradually its predictions get better

when we ask it to predict new halloween costumes we can also tell it how creative to be at the very lowest creativity setting it will almost always go with its top prediction producing lots of repetition while at the very highest setting it ventures into territory it deems less probable
sexy santa
note that at the beginning of training the neural network knew nothing at all about its input data it didn xe know the difference between letters and spaces or how to spell any words the more repetition it sees the more easily it can learn something unsurprisingly one of the first words it learns to spell reliably is xe csexy xe
as its training progresses it begins to learn more and more words adding xe csteampunk xe xe cminion xe xe ccardinalfish xe and xe cbellatrix xe to its vocabulary it learns new and exciting ways to use xe csexy xe including predicting sexy costumes that don xe yet exist
sexy king louis xvi
sexy michael cera
sexy printer
sexy marijuana bee
sexy tin man
sexy minecraft person
sexy abraham lincoln
sexy beet
sexy king louis xvi
sexy michael cera
sexy tin man
sexy abraham lincoln
sexy marijuana bee
sexy printer
sexy minecraft person
sexy beet
the neural network also gets better at copying costumes directly from its training data it does this because we told it to produce costumes like those it has already seen and as far as the neural network is concerned exactly copying its input data is perfect solution
everything that the neural network knows about is something that was in its input dataset xe it had no other information to work with for example it doesn xe know about this year xe hit movies so it still produces xe cpink panther xe more often than xe cblack panther xe even when it xe coining new words as in xe cfarty potter xe or xe cwerefish xe it xe not building them based on any understanding of the meanings of the words but has simply determined that they are probable letter combinations based on the costumes it has seen
and this is where neural networks and other machine learning algorithms get bit spooky it xe very hard to tell how they determine that these letter combinations xe like xe cbloody horse xe xe cgothed pines xe and xe cballerina trump xe xe are possible even when we can peer inside the neural network xe virtual brain and examine its virtual neurons the rules it learns for its prediction making are usually very hard to interpret people are working on algorithmic explainability for example group of google and carnegie mellon researchers were recently able to show an image recognition algorithm zeroing in on floppy ear shape as way to recognize dogs but many algorithms are much more difficult to interpret than image recognition algorithms xe for example the kind used to make loan or parole decisions xe and for the most part these algorithms are black boxes producing predictions without explanation
sometimes the ways algorithms work can have unexpected and disastrous consequences in researchers trained an algorithm that was supposed to figure out how to sort list of numbers the humans told the algorithm that the goal was to reduce sorting errors so the program deleted the list entirely leaving zero sorting errors and in another algorithm was supposed to learn to land an airplane on an aircraft carrier as gently as possible instead it discovered that in its simulation it could land the plane with such huge force that the simulation couldn xe store the measurement and would register zero force instead

it can be scary thing to trust decision that we don xe understand xe and it should be scary machine learning algorithms learn from whatever is in their training data even if their training data is full of the behaviors of biased humans in other words when we are using machine learning algorithms we get exactly what we ask for xe for better or worse for example an algorithm that sees hiring decisions biased by race or gender will predict biased hiring decisions and an algorithm that sees racial bias in parole decisions will learn to imitate this bias when making its own parole decisions after all we didn xe ask those algorithms what the best decision would have been we only asked them to predict which decisions the humans in its training data would have made
landing plane
parole decisions
job hiring
landing plane
job hiring
parole decisions
this kind of mistake happens all the time and biased algorithms are everywhere the moral of this story is not to expect artificial intelligence to be fair or impartial or to have the faintest clue about what our goals are instead we should expect ai merely to try its best to give us exactly what we ask for and we should be very careful what we ask for it would have been bad idea to put the plane landing algorithm xe recommendations into practice without checking them carefully and it would be bad idea to use the halloween costume algorithm xe predicted costumes without checking them first spirit of potatoes anyone

re xe universities face uncertainty as brexit looms xe learning section nytimes com april
brexit is creating uncertainty for british universities that is acutely felt by our european students and staff members but our global vision remains clear
imperial college london and other british universities are assertively campaigning in westminster and brussels for policies that support talent mobility and access to european research programs
over the last decade imperial scholars collaborated on more than research papers with european peers we want that figure to grow that is why we started seed fund after the brexit vote independent of government it is supporting scores of imperial academics xe european collaborations in fields like data privacy particle physics and cancer prevention
we have started similar seed funds with the massachusetts institute of technology and with tsinghua university in beijing as our global ambitions grow imperial recently opened an international mathematics laboratory in london with cnrs france xe research agency it cements the status of our two countries as global leaders in mathematics artificial intelligence and aligned disciplines
the lab xe researchers will enjoy equal access to european funding and collaborations even after brexit such partnerships should become more not less frequent
as an american academic in london was disappointed by the brexit vote yet british universities xe commitment to their core values of internationalism and excellence gives us reason to be confident in their future

on sunday night woman died after she was hit by self driving car operated by uber in tempe ariz the car was operating autonomously though safety driver was behind the wheel according to statement from the local police
uber is one of many companies now testing this kind of vehicle in arizona california and other parts of the country waymo the self driving car company owned by google xe parent company alphabet has said it is also operating autonomous cars on the outskirts of phoenix without safety driver behind the wheel on monday uber said it was halting tests in tempe pittsburgh toronto and san francisco
here is brief guide to the way these cars operate
when designing these vehicles companies like uber and waymo begin by building three dimensional map of place they equip ordinary automobiles with lidar sensors xe xe clight detection and ranging xe devices that measure distances using pulses of light xe and as company workers drive these cars on local roads these expensive devices collect the information needed to build the map
once the map is complete cars can use it to navigate the roads on their own as they do they continue to track their surroundings using lidar and they compare what they see with what the map shows in this way the car gains good idea of where it is in the world
lidar also alerts the cars to nearby objects including other cars pedestrians and bicyclists
lidar works pretty well but it can xe do everything it provides information only about objects that are relatively close which limits how fast cars can drive its measurements are not always sharp enough to distinguish one object from another and when multiple autonomous vehicles drive the same road their lidar signals can interfere with one another
even in situations where lidar works well these companies want backup systems in place so most driverless cars are also equipped with variety of other sensors
cameras radar and global positioning system antennas the kind of gps hardware that tells your smartphone where it is
with the gps antennas companies like uber and waymo are providing cars with even more information about where they are in the world
with cameras and radar sensors they can gather additional information about nearby pedestrians bicyclists cars and other objects
cameras also provide way to recognize traffic lights street signs road markings and other signals that cars need to take into account
that is the hard part sifting through all that data and responding to it require system of immense complexity
in some cases engineers will write specific rules that define how car should respond in particular situation if waymo car detects red light for example it is programmed to stop
but team of engineers could never write rules for every situation car could encounter so companies like waymo and uber are beginning to rely on xe cmachine learning xe systems that can learn behavior by analyzing vast amounts of data describing the country xe roadways
waymo now uses system that learns to identify pedestrians by analyzing thousands of photos that contain people walking or running across or near roads
it is unclear what happened in tempe
but these cars are designed so that if one system fails another will kick in in all likelihood the uber cars used lidar and radar as well as cameras to detect and respond to nearby objects including pedestrians
self driving cars can have difficulty duplicating the subtle nonverbal communication that goes on between pedestrians and drivers an autonomous vehicle after all can xe make eye contact with someone at crosswalk
xe cit is still important to realize how hard these problems are xe said ken goldberg professor at the university of california berkeley who specializes in robotics xe cthat is the thing that many don xe understand just because these are things humans do so effortlessly xe
these cars are designed to work at night when some sensors can operate just as well in the daytime some companies even argue that it is easier for these cars to operate at night
but there are conditions that these cars are still struggling to master they do not work as well in heavy precipitation they can have trouble in tunnels and on bridges and they may have difficulty dealing with heavy traffic

just over year after travis kalanick was ousted as chief executive of uber the ride hailing company released new financial results that showed continued growth and narrowing losses as it advances toward an initial public offering
on wednesday uber posted loss of million for the second quarter compared with loss of more than billion during the same period year earlier the company took in billion in gross bookings in the quarter xe or the amount of passenger fares and food delivery fees xe up percent from year ago after paying out fees to drivers revenue was billion when uber turned profit last quarter because it offloaded businesses in russia and southeast asia it cautioned that that bump would not last because it planned to reinvest the money
uber is not required to disclose earnings because it is privately held but it has made habit of publicly releasing its numbers investors are closely scrutinizing uber xe financials because the company is one of the world xe most highly valued private firms at billion and is preparing to go public by the end of its is expected to be one of the biggest ever for tech company
uber xe latest quarterly results indicate little change to its financial trajectory under dara khosrowshahi who became the company xe new chief executive last august mr khosrowshahi was brought in to clean up the toxic workplace culture at uber under his predecessor mr kalanick and to get the company ready for an the company xe no holds barred approach to barreling into markets and flouting regulations mr khosrowshahi has said had served it in the past but would not get the company to xe cthe next level xe
in recent months mr khosrowshahi has shed some of uber xe money losing businesses in regions including russia flown around the world to placate regulators settled lawsuits and launched new marketing campaign to mark fresh start for the company
but he has also had to weather new crises including the death of woman who was hit by an uber self driving car in arizona in march several executive departures and internal questions about the behavior of his handpicked no barney harford last week new york city passed legislation to halt new vehicle licenses for ride hail services potentially capping uber xe growth in one of its biggest markets
in statement mr khosrowshahi called uber xe growth xe cimpressive xe for business of its scale he added that the company was investing in areas that he considered xe cthe future of our platform xe including its food delivery service uber eats as well as in regions including the middle east and india
mr khosrowshahi did not mention self driving cars which were big bet under mr kalanick but which have come under increasing scrutiny since the pedestrian death uber scaled back its testing of autonomous vehicles after the crash and recently ended its development of self driving trucks
the company has been losing million to million every quarter on autonomous vehicles said person with knowledge of the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly the figures were earlier reported by the information
uber said its spending otherwise continues to be robust in its latest results the company said operating expenses totaled billion in the second quarter up from billion earlier this year

instagram is changing its algorithm to make things little more timely
users are now likely to see newer posts higher up the image sharing app said in statement on thursday adding that its feeds will xe cfeel more fresh xe instagram xe algorithm in other words won xe be meddling quite as much more images and videos will be allowed to bubble up as they come
the company also said it was testing xe cnew posts xe button so that users can refresh their feeds when they want to rather than automatically being transported to the top in the middle of browsing
the changes are in response to user feedback they appear to address some common gripes like how certain posts can keep appearing on your screen for days and days and days or how your feed can begin to feel skewed in favor of the same old friends you habitually double tap
xe cwe did this via number of changes including an adjustment so that very old content does not get bumped up higher in feed xe said gabe madway instagram xe spokesman
he added that the company was not returning to chronological feed as instagram said in its statement apparently addressing users in the western hemisphere xe cif your best friend shares selfie from her vacation in australia it will be waiting for you when you wake up xe
still the move appears to dial back even if only slightly the major change that came in march when instagram said feeds would be xe cordered to show the moments we believe you will care about the most xe
instagram is one of several social media companies that are striving to find the right balance between arranging content chronologically and ranking it according to machine learned impressions of relevance
twitter xe feed is largely chronological xe though it is has been known to experiment with ranking sometimes irritating users xe while facebook which owns instagram relies more heavily on algorithms meaning well liked content and posts from good friends tend to show up front and center
xe cinstagram xe feed ranking is powered by machine learning which is constantly adapting and improving based on new data xe mr madway said xe cbut this is nice change that people should notice xe
pew research center reported this month that instagram use is higher than that of twitter snapchat and whatsapp at least in terms of the percentage of americans who say they use it by that measure only facebook and youtube are more popular
last year the company said it had million users interacting with the app on at least monthly basis

hong kong xe artificial intelligence bots printed human organs genomic sequencing
these might seem to be natural topics of interest in country determined to be the world xe leader in science and technology but in china where censors are known to take heavy hand several artworks that look closely at these breakthroughs have been deemed taboo by local cultural officials
the works which raise questions about the social and ethical implications of artificial intelligence and biotechnology were abruptly pulled last weekend from the coming guangzhou triennial on the orders of cultural authorities in the southern chinese province of guangdong
the artists from europe australia and the united states were not given an official reason why their works were rejected for the show which opens on dec at the guangdong museum of art the pieces did not touch on the tiananmen democracy crackdown of independence for taiwan or tibet or the private wealth of chinese communist party leaders xe topics that are widely known to be off limits for public discussion in china
as result some of the show xe curators and the affected artists have been left guessing as to why the works were banned their conclusion the works were perhaps too timely too relevant and therefore too discomforting for chinese officials
xe cthe news is really filled with concern about the gene editing of babies xe said heather dewey hagborg an american artist whose work xe ct xe was among those pulled from the show xe cit definitely seems like moment where can imagine that art or any kind of content that deals with biotechnological futures and some of the vulnerabilities and the dark side of those futures might seem to be dangerous xe
ms dewey hagborg was referring to the explosive revelation last month that the chinese scientist he jiankui said he had created the world xe first genetically edited babies following the announcement scientists in china and abroad condemned dr he xe conduct calling it reckless and unethical
against that background work like xe ct xe by ms dewey hagborg with toshiaki ozawa would seem to be especially timely the four channel video tells the fictional story of biohacker who becomes obsessed with an anonymous donor whose saliva she purchases online by analyzing the dna in the saliva and using genealogy website the biohacker is able to identify the anonymous donor according to ms dewey hagborg the video is intended to raise questions about biological commodification privacy and bioethics
but in china where officials are often incentivized to err on the side of caution and prioritize social stability above all else stirring up public debate with hard hitting questions about ethics is not always welcome endeavor
angelique spaninks director of mu an independent art space in the netherlands and one of the curators of the guangzhou triennial said xe cthe privacy stuff even makes me uncomfortable and of course the work is very strong piece because of that xe but anything that creates discomfort she said xe cmakes officials here nervous xe
the other banned works include xe the modular body xe an online science fiction story about using human cells and artificial organs to create living organism created by dutch artist floris kaayk the work is intended to raise questions about the potential for printing of human organs about extending life with the help of technology and about the desire to design life from scratch
also pulled from the show was xe im here to learn so xe by zach blas and jemima wyman four channel video that resurrects tay an artificial intelligence bot created by microsoft in that was shut down in less than day after users trained it to be bigot according to mr blas museum officials in china had initially asked to cut two lines in the video an obscenity and reference to adolf hitler before cultural authorities decided ultimately to reject the entire work which also deals with issues of feminism
work by the artist lawrence lek from london was also pulled from the show as was part of multichannel video work by harun farocki filmmaker who died in according to curators
huang yaqun the deputy director of academic affairs at the guangdong museum of art state backed museum and the host of the triennial said that the decision to cut the works was based in part on their xe cincompatibility with the guangdong people xe taste and cultural habits xe
though some were caught off guard by the last minute decision to pull works from the triennial such setbacks are frequent occurrence for many in china xe art circles when dealing with the country xe often unpredictable censorship review process
contrary to the notion of china xe censorship apparatus as an all powerful monolith the effort to get an exhibition past cultural officials is often constant negotiation and balancing act that can depend on factors including which authorities are in charge and what the local situation is exhibition organizers are often forced to come up with clever strategies to circumvent or assuage censors by for example showing work without explanatory text or putting age restrictions on access to show
xe cusually they reject work mentioning political or internal affairs or nudity xe said victoria jonathan art director of jimei arles international photo festival which is held every year in the southern chinese city of xiamen and is partner of the annual rencontres de la photographie xe arles xe csometimes they object to something because it xe related to the news and sometimes their decision just doesn xe make sense at all xe
china is not alone in pulling images that it deems potentially disturbing last year the guggenheim museum removed three works by chinese artists from highly anticipated exhibition xe including one featuring pit bulls on treadmills xe after pressure from animal rights supporters and others over the show xe cart and china after theater of the world xe some critics said the guggenheim should have used the controversy as moment to engage the public about difficult art
though ms spaninks the guangzhou triennial xe curator said she was disappointed with the decision to pull the current works she was hopeful that the remaining pieces in the show which is titled xe cas we may think feedforward xe could still trigger debate about the future of science and technology assuming no further cuts are made to the show the exhibition which runs until march will feature more than artists including lynn hershman leeson wang yuyang and tega brain
still mr kaayk who said he had spent months preparing xe cthe modular body xe for the show only to find out at the last minute that it had been banned said in an email that he felt xe cvery frustrated xe
xe cisn xe contemporary art meant to raise questions and start discussions about important subjects in actuality and those of our near future xe he wrote xe cwhat are china xe reasons for organizing all these big expensive xe contemporary art xe manifestations if these questions the core of contemporary art freedom of speech freedom of mind are ignored and undermined xe

in phoenix cars are self navigating the streets in many homes people are barking commands at tiny machines with the machines responding on our smartphones apps can now recognize faces in photos and translate from one language to another
artificial intelligence is here xe and it xe bringing new possibilities while also raising questions do these gadgets and services really behave as advertised how will they evolve in the years ahead how quickly will they overhaul the way we live and change the way we do business
the times is exploring these matters this week at our annual new work summit featuring technology executives researchers investors and others here are some of the key moments coming out of the conference plus rundown of some of our recent stories xe cade metz
month after the chinese electronics giant huawei suffered big setback in its quest to sell its high end smartphones to americans the company xe chief for consumer devices richard yu said he was still optimistic about huawei xe prospects in the united states
xe cwe have won global consumers xe trust in over countries xe mr yu said at the new work summit xe cwe very strictly protect consumers xe privacy xe
huawei is the world xe third largest seller of smartphones and one of the planet xe biggest suppliers of telecommunications equipment but it has struggled for years to break into the united states
congressional report said that huawei xe network gear could be used by beijing to spy on americans effectively cutting the company off from big buyers in the united states in january after lawmakers reiterated those concerns in letter to the federal communications commission at amp and verizon walked away from deals to sell huawei xe latest phones
at the conference on tuesday mr yu said that huawei had no ties to the chinese government xe cwe are globalized company just headquartered in china xe he said xe cwe are not part of any government we have to be company that is independent from every country xe
huawei would not be able to do business in so many places around the world without that independence he said xe cif we do something for one government we will lose the trust of all governments xe xe raymond zhong
mike schroepfer facebook xe chief technology officer offered glimpse of how the social network is applying artificial intelligence to ward off bad actors and keep its platform free of toxicity
calling the fight against rules violators xe ccat and mouse game xe mr schroepfer said at the new work summit on tuesday that facebook xe efforts had succeeded at certain types of content moderation such as image classifier algorithms that find and automatically remove nude photos and videos
now on facebook he said xe cthe vast majority of nudity and pornography reporting is automatic xe
but what about using to curb the spread of fake news facebook xe director of artificial intelligence ann lecun said in that machine learning algorithms would one day be able to weed out false news on facebook
but the company has since added thousands of human content moderators and struck partnerships with human fact checking organizations mr schroepfer implied facebook has learned that alone would not do the trick given the sophistication of bad actors who find ways around the platform xe filters
mr schroepfer also said that human judgment would be required in certain situations like comment xe cnice jacket xe that could be either an earnest compliment or sarcastic insult depending on the context and when it comes to some of facebook xe thornier problems like trying to enforce consistent hate speech policies human intervention may always be necessary
xe cwhenever you are debating what your policy is you xe re unlikely to build an that works well for that xe he said xe kevin roose
michael kratsios deputy chief technology officer at the white house said at the new work summit on tuesday that regulators should get out of the way of advances in emerging technologies
he cited progress toward repeal of some regulations on commercial drones such as rules prohibiting them from flying at night
xe cfor us it xe key to get ahead of those regulatory hurdles xe said mr kratsios who previously worked as chief of staff to peter thiel the libertarian venture capitalist these regulations he said are xe cputting us at disadvantage xe
unlike some experts who believe china is poised to dominate the age mr kratsios said he wasn xe worried about overseas competition the united states he said has xe year head start xe in development
and despite the white house xe reputation for chaos and tumult he maintained that it was xe ca great place to work xe xe kevin roose
marc benioff the chief executive of salesforce blasted companies like facebook on tuesday for addicting children to their products and renewed his calls for more government regulation of the tech industry
mr benioff compared new facebook messenger product for children to candy cigarettes which he used to pretend to smoke as boy
xe cwhat do you think they were trying to get us to do with those xe mr benioff asked onstage at the new work summit xe ci don xe think this is any different now they xe re focused on the addictive nature of these user interfaces at some point we have to say xe hold on xe xe
silicon valley is nearing the point where moral lines will have to be drawn by the government since the industry is not regulating itself and does not seem to be guided by xe cstrong hand of ethics xe he said
there is xe ccrisis of trust xe he added that will become xe ctidal wave xe among american consumers who are growing wary of tech giants
xe ci xe trying to protect our industry xe said mr benioff whose company sells access to business software over the internet xe cif companies aren xe able to regulate themselves they should have external regulations xe
one of the solutions he suggested was to move decision making away from algorithms and back toward humans he cited facebook xe decision to disband its trending news curation team as an example
xe cfacebook had team promoting sorting and focusing stories curators that they removed and put an algorithm in their place and that started the downward spiral that they xe re in today xe mr benioff said
he also spoke about the recent ban on kegs of beer at salesforce offices after he recently stumbled across one while visiting company he had acquired
xe ci view alcohol as drug xe he said xe cthe keg is not there anymore xe well actually who knows but hope it xe not took photo of the keg and put it on our social network and said xe this is not who we are xe xe xe nellie bowles
fei fei li chief scientist at google and stanford professor has called on technologists to take more xe chuman centered xe approach to the creation of artificial intelligence on tuesday at the new work summit ms li said that researchers must work to ensure that embodied human qualities and that it would ultimately operate alongside humans not replace them
xe ci often tell my students not to be misled by the name xe artificial intelligence xe xe there is nothing artificial about it xe she said xe ca is made by humans intended to behave by humans and ultimately to impact humans lives and human society xe
at stanford ms li was instrumental in the recent rise of xe ccomputer vision xe systems that can recognize people and objects entirely on their own at google she is working to package and sell these and other systems as cloud computing services delivering the latest technology to wide range of businesses
but she said that as google and other internet giants pushed these techniques forward academia and the government must help ensure that evolved into something that enhanced our humanity created as many jobs as it replaced and operated in safe and predictable ways
in particular ms li said academic institutions can help ensure that computer scientists work alongside social scientists in building this new breed of technology
xe ca has outgrown its origin in computer science xe she said
ultimately said ms li who was born in china reflects the people who build it more than other technologies do for that reason and others she said researchers must work in way that spans not only many industries but many cultures as well
xe ci really believe there are no borders for science xe she said xe cade metz
tuesday xe first speaker at the new work summit was kai fu lee who used to lead google in china and knows thing or two about american tech giants in china his prognosis about whether companies like facebook will ever be able to crack the world xe largest internet market
xe cthe american products are simply uncompetitive in the china market xe said mr lee who is now chief executive of sinovation ventures venture capital firm focused on chinese technology even if internet titans from the united states could operate in china he said the local competition means they would have hard time thriving
xe cmessenger is much worse product than wechat xe he said referring to facebook xe messaging app and tencent xe ubiquitous app for chatting social networking making payments and other tasks
xe camazon in china is substantially worse than taobao jd and tmall xe he said referring to three leading chinese commerce sites and he said xe capple pay is much narrower and much harder to use than wechat or alipay xe
mr lee sees other issues that augur against big facebook or google renaissance in china multinational companies tend not to hire local managers to lead their china operations xe cthey xe re not concerned about winning in the local market xe he said
also young chinese these days would rather work for national champions like alibaba or tencent pitted against chinese start ups and big companies where the hours tend to be long and the work culture cutthroat the leading lights of american tech would get xe cget eaten for lunch xe xe raymond zhong
last year the chinese government unveiled plan to become the world leader in artificial intelligence by vowing to create domestic industry worth billion this manifesto read like challenge to the united states and in many ways it echoed policies laid down by the obama administration in
but as china pushes ahead in this area many experts are concerned that the trump administration is not doing enough to keep the united states ahead in the future although the big united states internet giants are leading the race these experts believe the country as whole could fall behind if does not do more to nurture research inside universities and government labs xe cade metz
john krafcik chief executive of the self driving car company waymo took the stage at the new work summit on monday night and spoke out for the first time since his company reached settlement last week with uber in lawsuit over trade secrets that riveted silicon valley
xe cwe were really happy with the outcome that we engineered xe mr krafcik said xe cwe spent lot of time in that case talking about the hardware but the extra benefit we got from that suit was the ability to understand and ensure that uber wasn xe using any of our software xe
he called the software waymo xe xe csecret sauce xe
waymo and uber spent only four days at trial last week before settling with uber agreeing to provide waymo percent of its stock worth about million the dispute between the companies started in when uber bought otto start up founded by anthony levandowski an early member of google xe self driving car program waymo which was spun out of google accused mr levandowski of stealing technology before leaving and accused uber of using the misappropriated knowledge
xe cthis was really special case with really special set of circumstances xe mr krafcik said xe cfor us this was always about and really just about the fact that we needed to ensure uber wasn xe using our trade secrets xe he added that he did not foresee waymo suing other former employees
mr krafcik also discussed how waymo was looking to start ride hailing service which it is testing in phoenix with thousands of driverless pacifica minivans
xe cwe have plan to move from city to city xe he said xe cwe xe re not going to be launching with mile per hour product we xe re talking about full speed service that will serve very large geographic area with essentially unlimited pickup and drop off points xe xe nellie bowles
jeff wilke amazon xe chief executive of its consumer business which includes its commerce operations doesn xe often make public appearances but on monday night he joined the new work summit to discuss the internet retailer xe move into artificial intelligence
his key message is everywhere but that doesn xe mean it will take our jobs
xe cif you look at the evolution of technology over the course of decades tech doesn xe eliminate work it changes work xe mr wilke said
he said that over the last five years since amazon bought robot maker called kiva systems it had built of the robots xe and also hired people xe cwe still need human judgment xe he said
amazon has also embedded throughout the company he added with technologists working together with people who run businesses the company is using machine learning and deep learnings which are different flavors of to upgrade internal algorithms he said
as to how amazon might use at whole foods the grocery store chain that it said it would acquire last year mr wilke said little when asked whether amazon would integrate its cashier less and driven convenience store concept called amazon go with whole foods he said xe ci don xe foresee the format of whole foods changing very much xe xe pui wing tam
as technology barrels ahead in silicon valley it xe also starting to pick up steam as political issue in washington
over the weekend wrote about andrew yang former tech executive who has decided to run for president in as democrat on xe cbeware the robots xe platform he thinks that with innovations like self driving cars and grocery stores without cashiers just around the corner we xe re about to move into frightening new era of mass unemployment and social unrest
so he xe proposing universal basic income plan called the xe cfreedom dividend xe which would give every american adult month to guarantee them minimum standard of living while they retrain themselves for new kinds of work
mr yang xe campaign is long shot and there are significant hurdles to making universal basic income politically feasible but the conversation about automation xe social and economic consequences is long overdue even if he doesn xe win the election mr yang may have hit on the next big political wedge issue xe kevin roose
in modern artificial intelligence data rules software is only as smart as the data used to train it as steve lohr recently wrote and that means that some of the biases in the real world can seep into
if there are many more white men than black women in the system for example it will be worse at identifying the black women that appears to be the case with some popular commercial facial recognition software
joy buolamwini researcher at the media lab found that the software can now tell if white man in photograph is male or female percent of the time but for darker skinned women it is wrong nearly percent of the time xe joseph plambeck

foul mouthed year old with taste for booze and cigarettes an alien shape changer struggling with his sexuality an addled space explorer out of sync with time these are some of the colorful characters of the comic book series black hammer and they are now potential stars of film and television in deal announced tuesday
the series is being picked up by legendary entertainment which has produced more than feature films including xe cbatman begins xe in black hammer first published by dark horse in was created by the writer jeff lemire and the artist dean ormston xe cwith our development team one of our big initiatives was to bring in superhero universe xe said nick pepper the president of legendary television studios xe cwe were lucky enough that this was available xe financial details of the deal were not disclosed and timing is not yet set on the debut of the first project
in black hammer heroes like golden gail woman in her who feels trapped by her young superpowered body barbalien gay martian and colonel weird whose explorations have left him on edge find themselves stranded in farm community year upon year with little hope of getting home each issue reveals more of their plight their efforts at connection with their fellow residents and the quest by family member to find them
the comic is one of several projects by lemire prolific writer and cartoonist that has been optioned but xe cwith black hammer it xe not just one book it xe whole universe with multiple books xe and it will be multiple projects for film and television xe lemire said the black hammer universe includes the main series and three mini series so far that take staples of the superhero genre like magic words that grant special abilities and turn them on their head
in black hammer received the eisner xe the industry equivalent of an academy award xe for best new series it was also nominated for best writer and won second prize for best lettering the los angeles review of books praised the series for its xe ccompelling and emotionally terse world xe singling out the drawings of ormston and the colors of dave stewart that xe cconvey the heavy dread of banal life simultaneously with the weird and fantastical elements threaded throughout the domestic drama xe
the farm setting is special place for lemire who was born and raised in rural area in essex county ontario he began his career with xe cessex county trilogy xe fictional version of his childhood upbringing xe ci never thought in million years xe actually be able to write for marvel or dc comics xe he said though he eventually found himself working usually as writer for those companies which are primarily known for their superhero fare
xe cblack hammer is my love letter to superhero comics as an indie comic xe he said the series he said gives him chance to explore stories that he might not have been able to do with flagship characters who are often weighed down by years of storytelling or merchandising concerns
there is seemingly endless array of comic book based fare on screens big and small with more on the way one reason comics appeal to producers is the potential to exploit an existing audience noted monica landers chief executive of storyfit which uses data and machine learning to predict content marketability another reason xe cis that there xe just lot more story in the written development xe she said by email xe cthis means that producers have choices and can focus on the specific stories that will most resonate in this medium for television series this means that producers have strong platform from which to grow and extend xe like we xe ve seen in xe handmaid xe tale xe xe
being able to tap the expanding world of the black hammer comic books and the ideas lemire has for the series is part of what attracted legendary xe cthe way he mapped out the universe and all the time periods for me it feels like something very special there xe pepper said
lemire will be involved in writing the adaptations adding to workload that includes graphic novel xe cfrogcatchers xe to be published by simon amp schuster next year xe cthe more projects have the more creative become xe he said xe cwith black hammer xe at least year or two ahead of being published xe which allows him to take breaks though those often involve other projects like screenplays or drawing comics xe cit doesn xe even feel like work for me xe he said xe cit xe what would be doing anyway the more can do the more xe ll do xe
an earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the chief executive of storyfit she is monica landers not launders

san francisco xe countless dollars and entire scientific careers have been dedicated to predicting where and when the next big earthquake will strike but unlike weather forecasting which has significantly improved with the use of better satellites and more powerful mathematical models earthquake prediction has been marred by repeated failure
some of the world xe most destructive earthquakes xe china in haiti in and japan in among them xe occurred in areas that seismic hazard maps had deemed relatively safe the last large earthquake to strike los angeles northridge in occurred on fault that did not appear on seismic maps
now with the help of artificial intelligence growing number of scientists say changes in the way they can analyze massive amounts of seismic data can help them better understand earthquakes anticipate how they will behave and provide quicker and more accurate early warnings
xe ci am actually hopeful for the first time in my career that we will make progress on this problem xe said paul johnson fellow at the los alamos national laboratory who is among those at the forefront of this research
well aware of past earthquake prediction failures scientists are cautious when asked how much progress they have made using some in the field refer to prediction as xe cthe word xe because they do not even want to imply it is possible but one important goal they say is to be able to provide reliable forecasts
the earthquake probabilities that are provided on seismic hazard maps for example have crucial consequences most notably in instructing engineers how they should construct buildings critics say these maps are remarkably inexact
map of los angeles lists the probability of an earthquake producing strong shaking within given period of time xe usually years that is based on complex formula that takes into account among other things the distance from fault how fast one side of fault is moving past the other and the recurrence of earthquakes in the area
study led by katherine scharer geologist with the united states geological survey estimated dates for nine previous earthquakes along the southern california portion of the san andreas fault dating back to the eighth century the last big earthquake on the san andreas was in
since the average interval between these big earthquakes was years common interpretation is that southern california is due for big earthquake yet the intervals between earthquakes are so varied xe ranging from years to years xe that taking the average is not very useful prediction tool big earthquake could come tomorrow or it could come in century and half or more
this is one of the criticisms of philip stark an associate dean at the university of california berkeley at the division of mathematical and physical sciences dr stark describes the overall system of earthquake probabilities as xe csomewhere between meaningless and misleading xe and has called for it to be scrapped
the new related earthquake research is leaning on neural networks the same technology that has accelerated the progress of everything from talking digital assistants to driverless cars loosely modeled on the web of neurons in the human brain neural network is complex mathematical system that can learn tasks on its own
scientists say seismic data is remarkably similar to the audio data that companies like google and amazon use in training neural networks to recognize spoken commands on coffee table digital assistants like alexa when studying earthquakes it is the computer looking for patterns in mountains of data rather than relying on the weary eyes of scientist
xe crather than sequence of words we have sequence of ground motion measurements xe said zachary ross researcher in the california institute of technology xe seismological laboratory who is exploring these techniques xe cwe are looking for the same kinds of patterns in this data xe
brendan meade professor of earth and planetary sciences at harvard began exploring these techniques after spending sabbatical at google company at the forefront of research
his first project showed that at the very least these machine learning methods could significantly accelerate his experiments he and his graduate students used neural network to run an earthquake analysis times faster than they could in the past what once took days now took minutes
dr meade also found that these techniques could lead to new insights in the fall with other researchers from google and harvard he published paper showing how neural networks can forecast earthquake aftershocks this kind of project he believes represents an enormous shift in the way earthquake science is done similar work is underway at places like caltech and stanford university
xe cwe are at point where the technology can do as well as xe or better than xe human experts xe dr ross said
driving that guarded optimism is the belief that as sensors get smaller and cheaper scientists will be able to gather larger amounts of seismic data with help from neural networks and similar techniques they hope to glean new insights from all this data
dr ross and other caltech researchers are using these techniques to build systems that can more accurately recognize earthquakes as they are happening and anticipate where the epicenter is and where the shaking will spread
japan and mexico have early warning systems and california just rolled out its own but scientists say artificial intelligence could greatly improve their accuracy helping predict the direction and intensity of rupture in the earth xe crust and providing earlier warnings to hospitals and other institutions that could benefit from few extra seconds of preparation
xe cthe more detail you have the better your forecasts will be xe dr ross said
scientists working on these projects said neural networks have their limits though they are good at finding familiar signals in data they are not necessarily suited to finding new kinds of signals xe like the sounds tectonic plates make as they grind together
but at los alamos dr johnson and his colleagues have shown that machine learning technique called xe crandom forests xe can identify previously unknown signals in simulated fault created inside lab in one case their system showed that particular sound made by the fault which scientists previously thought was meaningless was actually an indication of when an earthquake would arrive
some scientists like robert geller seismologist at the university of tokyo are unconvinced that will improve earthquake forecasts he questions the very premise that past earthquakes can predict future ones and ultimately he said we would only know the effectiveness of forecasting when earthquakes can be predicted beyond random chance
xe cthere are no shortcuts xe dr geller said xe cif you cannot predict the future then your hypothesis is wrong xe

looking to the future has always defined humanity will become the best crystal ball of all

randy buckner was graduate student at washington university in st louis in when he stumbled across one of the most important discoveries of modern brain science for buckner xe as for many of his peers during the early xe xe the discovery was so counterintuitive that it took years to recognize its significance
buckner xe lab run by the neuroscientists marcus raichle and steven petersen was exploring what the new technology of pet scanning could show about the connection between language and memory in the human brain the promise of the pet machine lay in how it measured blood flow to different parts of the brain allowing researchers for the first time to see detailed neural activity not just anatomy in buckner xe study the subjects were asked to recall words from memorized list by tracking where the brain was consuming the most energy during the task buckner and his colleagues hoped to understand which parts of the brain were engaged in that kind of memory
but there was catch different regions of the brain vary widely in how much energy they consume no matter what the brain is doing if you ask someone to do mental math while scanning her brain in pet machine you won xe learn anything from that scan on its own because the subtle changes that reflect the mental math task will be drowned out by the broader patterns of blood flow throughout the brain to see the specific regions activated by specific task researchers needed baseline comparison control
at first this seemed simple enough put the subjects in the pet scanner ask them to sit there and do nothing xe what the researchers sometimes called resting state xe and then ask them to perform the task under study the assumption was that by comparing the two images the resting brain and the active brain the researchers could discern which regions were consuming more energy while performing the task
but something went strangely wrong when buckner scanned the resting states of their subjects xe cwhat happened is that we began putting people in scanners that can measure their brain activity xe buckner recalls now xe cand mother nature shouted back at us xe when people were told to sit and do nothing the pet scans showed distinct surge of mental energy in some regions the resting state turned out to be more active than the active state
the odd blast of activity during the resting state would be observed in dozens of other studies using similar control structure during this period to this first generation of scientists using pet scans the active rest state was viewed in buckner xe words as xe ca confound as troublesome xe confound is an errant variable that prevents scientist from doing proper control study it xe noise mere interference getting in the way of the signal that science is looking for buckner and his colleagues noted the strange activity in paper submitted in but almost as an afterthought or an apology
but that passing nod to the strangely active xe cresting state xe turned out to be one of the first hints of what would become revolution in our understanding of human intelligence not long after buckner xe paper was published brain scientist at the university of iowa named nancy andreasen decided to invert the task control structure that had dominated the early neuroimaging studies instead of battling the xe ctroublesome xe resting state andreasen and her team would make it the focus of their study
andreasen xe background outside neuroscience might have helped her perceive the value lurking in the rest state where her peers saw only trouble as professor of renaissance literature she published scholarly appraisal of john donne xe xe cconservative revolutionary xe poetics after switching fields in her she eventually began exploring the mystery of creativity through the lens of brain imaging xe calthough neither freudian nor psychoanalyst knew enough about human mental activity to quickly perceive what foolish xe control task xe rest was xe she would later write xe cmost investigators made the convenient assumption that the brain would be blank or neutral during xe rest xe from introspection knew that my own brain is often at its most active when stretch out on bed or sofa and close my eyes xe
andreasen xe study the results of which were eventually published in the american journal of psychiatry in included subtle dig at the way the existing community had demoted this state to baseline control she called this mode the rest state for random episodic silent thought the surge of activity that the pet scans revealed was not confound andreasen argued it was clue in our resting states we do not rest left to its own devices the human brain resorts to one of its most emblematic tricks maybe one that helped make us human in the first place
it time travels
imagine it xe late evening on workday and you xe re taking your dog for walk before bedtime few dozen paces from your front door as you settle into your usual route through the neighborhood your mind wanders to an important meeting scheduled for next week you picture it going well xe there xe subtle rush of anticipatory pleasure as you imagine the scene xe and you allow yourself to hope that this might set the stage for you to ask your boss for raise not right away mind you but maybe in few months you imagine her saying yes and what that salary bump would mean next year you and your spouse might finally be able to get out of the rental market and buy house in nicer neighborhood nearby the one with the better school district but then your mind shifts to problem you xe ve been wrestling with lately member of your team is brilliant but temperamental his emotional swings can be explosive just today perceiving slight from colleague he started berating her in the middle of meeting he seems to have no sense of decorum no ability to rein in his emotions
as you walk you remember the physical sense of unease in the room as your colleague ranted over the most meaningless offense you imagine meeting six months from now with comparable eruption xe only this time it xe happening in front of your boss small wave of stress washes over you perhaps he xe just not the right fit for the job you think xe which reminds you of the one time you fired an employee five years ago your mind conjures the awkward intensity of that conversation and then imagines how much more explosive comparable conversation would be with your current employee you feel sensation close to physical fear as your mind runs through the scenario
in just few minutes of mental wandering you have made several distinct round trips from past to future forward week to the important meeting forward year or more to the house in the new neighborhood backward five hours to today xe meeting forward six months backward five years forward few weeks you xe ve built chains of cause and effect connecting those different moments you xe ve moved seamlessly from actual events to imagined ones and as you xe ve navigated through time your brain and body xe emotional system has generated distinct responses to each situation real and imagined the whole sequence is master class in temporal gymnastics in these moments of unstructured thinking our minds dart back and forth between past and future like film editor scrubbing through the frames of movie
the sequence of thoughts does not feel subjectively like hard work it does not seem to require mental effort the scenarios just flow out of your mind because these imagined futures come so easily to us we have long underestimated the significance of the skill the pet scanner allowed us to appreciate for the first time just how complex this kind of cognitive time travel actually is
in her paper nancy andreasen included two key observations that would grow in significance over the subsequent decades when she interviewed the subjects afterward they described their mental activity during the rest state as kind of effortless shifting back and forth in time xe cthey think freely about variety of things xe andreasen wrote xe cespecially events of the past few days or future activities of the current or next several days xe perhaps most intriguing andreasen noted that most of the rest activity took place in what are called the association cortices of the brain the regions of the brain that are most pronounced in homo sapiens compared with other primates and that are often the last to become fully operational as the human brain develops through adolescence and early adulthood xe capparently when the brain mind thinks in free and unencumbered fashion xe she wrote xe cit uses its most human and complex parts xe
in the years that followed andreasen xe pioneering work in the late and early series of studies and papers mapped out the network of brain activity that she first identified in randy buckner xe adviser at washington university marcus raichle coined new term for the phenomenon the xe cdefault mode network xe or just xe cthe default network xe the phrase stuck today google scholar lists thousands of academic studies that have investigated the default network xe cit looks to me like this is the most important discovery of cognitive neuroscience xe says the university of pennsylvania psychologist martin seligman the seemingly trivial activity of mind wandering is now believed to play central role in the brain xe xe cdeep learning xe the mind xe sifting through past experiences imagining future prospects and assessing them with emotional judgments that flash of shame or pride or anxiety that each scenario elicits
growing number of scholars drawn from wide swath of disciplines xe neuroscience philosophy computer science xe now argue that this aptitude for cognitive time travel revealed by the discovery of the default network may be the defining property of human intelligence xe cwhat best distinguishes our species xe seligman wrote in times op ed with john tierney xe cis an ability that scientists are just beginning to appreciate we contemplate the future xe he went on xe ca more apt name for our species would be homo prospectus because we thrive by considering our prospects the power of prospection is what makes us wise xe
it is unclear whether nonhuman animals have any real concept of the future at all some organisms display behavior that has long term consequences like squirrel xe burying nut for winter but those behaviors are all instinctive the latest studies of animal cognition suggest that some primates and birds may carry out deliberate preparations for events that will occur in the near future but making decisions based on future prospects on the scale of months or years xe even something as simple as planning gathering of the tribe week from now xe would be unimaginable even to our closest primate relatives if the homo prospectus theory is correct those limited time traveling skills explain an important piece of the technological gap that separates humans from all other species on the planet it xe lot easier to invent new tool if you can imagine future where that tool might be useful what gave flight to the human mind and all its inventiveness may not have been the usual culprits of our opposable thumbs or our gift for language it may instead have been freeing our minds from the tyranny of the present
the capacity for prospection has been reflected in and amplified by many of the social and scientific revolutions that shaped human history agriculture itself would have been unimaginable without working model of the future predicting seasonal changes visualizing the long term improvements possible from domesticating crops banking and credit systems require minds capable of sacrificing present tense value for the possibility of greater gains in the future for vaccines to work we needed patients willing to introduce potential pathogen into their bodies for lifetime of protection against disease we are born with singular gift for imagining the future but we have been enhancing those gifts since the dawn of civilization today new enhancements are on the horizon in the form of machine learning algorithms that already outperform humans at certain kinds of forecasts as stands poised to augment our most essential human talent we are faced with curious question how will the future be different if we get much better at predicting it
xe ctime travel feels like an ancient tradition rooted in old mythologies old as gods and dragons xe james gleick observes in his book xe ctime travel history xe xe cit isn xe though the ancients imagined immortality and rebirth and lands of the dead time machines were beyond their ken time travel is fantasy of the modern era xe the idea of using technology to move through time as effortlessly as we move through space appears to have been first conceived by wells at the end of the th century eventually showcased in his pioneering work of science fiction xe cthe time machine xe
but machines have been soothsayers from the beginning in sponge divers stranded after storm in the mediterranean discovered an underwater statuary on the shoals of the greek island antikythera it turned out to be the wreck of ship more than years old during the subsequent salvage operation divers recovered the remnants of puzzling clocklike contraption with precision cut gears annotated with cryptic symbols that were corroded beyond recognition for years the device lay unnoticed in museum drawer until british historian named derek de solla price rediscovered it in the early and began the laborious process of reconstructing it xe an effort that scholars have continued into the st century we now know that the device was capable of predicting the behavior of the sun the moon and five of the planets the device was so advanced that it could even predict with meaningful accuracy solar or lunar eclipses that wouldn xe occur for decades
the antikythera mechanism as it has come to be known is sometimes referred to as an ancient computer the analogy is misleading the underlying technology behind the device was much closer to clock than programmable computer but at its essence it was prediction machine clock is there to tell you about the present the mechanism was there to tell you about the future that its creators went to such great lengths to predict eclipses seems telling while some ancient societies did believe that eclipses harmed crops knowing about them in advance wouldn xe have been of much use what seems far more useful is the sense of magic and wonder that such prediction could provide and the power that could be acquired as result imagine standing in front of the masses and announcing that tomorrow the sun will transform for more than minute into fire tinged black orb then imagine the awe when the prophecy comes true
prediction machines have only multiplied since the days of the ancient greeks where those original clockwork devices dealt with deterministic futures like the motions of solar bodies increasingly our time traveling tools forecast probabilities and likelihoods allowing us to imagine possible futures for more complex systems in the late thanks to improvements in public health records and mathematical advances in statistics the british astronomer edmund halley and the dutch scientist christiaan huygens separately made the first rigorous estimates of average life expectancy around the same time there was an explosion of insurance companies their business made possible by this newfound ability to predict future risk initially they focused on the commercial risk of new shipping ventures but eventually insurance would come to offer protection against just about every future threat imaginable fire floods disease in the th century randomized controlled trials allowed us to predict the future effects of medical interventions finally separating out the genuine cures from the snake oil in the digital age spreadsheet software took accounting tools that were originally designed to record the past activity of business and transformed them into tools for projecting out forecasts letting us click through alternate financial scenarios in much the way our minds wander through various possible futures
but cognitive time travel has been enhanced by more than just science and technology the invention of storytelling itself can be seen as kind of augmentation of the default network xe gift for time travel stories do not just allow us to conjure imaginary worlds they also free us from being mired in linear time analepsis and prolepsis xe flashbacks and flash forwards xe constitute some of the oldest literary devices in the canon deployed in ancient narratives like the xe codyssey xe and the xe carabian nights xe time machines have obviously proliferated in the content of sci fi narratives since xe cthe time machine xe was published but time travel has also infiltrated the form of modern storytelling defining trick of recent popular narrative is the contorted timeline with movies and tv shows embracing temporal schemes that would have baffled mainstream audiences just few decades ago the epic often inscrutable plot of the tv show xe clost xe veered among past present and future with reckless glee the blockbuster movie xe carrival xe featured bewildering time scheme that skipped forward more than times to future events while intimating throughout that they were actually occurring in the past the current hit series xe cthis is us xe reinvented the family soap opera genre by structuring each episode as series of time jumps sometimes spanning more than years the final five minutes of the season opener which aired earlier this fall jump back and forth seven times among and some unspecified future that looks to be about
these narrative developments suggest an intriguing possibility that popular entertainment is training our minds to get better at cognitive time travel if you borrowed wells xe time machine and jumped back to then asked typical viewers of xe cgunsmoke xe and xe ci love lucy xe to watch xe carrival xe or xe clost xe they would have found the temporal high jinks deeply disorienting back then even single flashback required extra hand holding xe remember the rippling screen xe to signify the temporal leap only experimental narratives dared challenge the audience with more complex time schemes today xe popular narratives zip around their fictional timelines with the speed of the default network itself
the elaborate timelines of popular narrative may be training our minds to contemplate more complex temporal schemes but could new technology augment our skills more directly we have long heard promises of xe csmart drugs xe on the horizon that will enhance our memory but if the homo prospectus argument is correct we should probably be looking for breakthroughs that will enhance our predictive powers as well
in way those advances are already around us but in the form of software not pharmaceuticals if you have ever found yourself mentally running through alternate possibilities for coming outing xe what happens if it rains xe based on day weather forecast your prospective powers have been enhanced by the time traveling skills of climate supercomputers that churn through billions of alternative atmospheric scenarios drawn from the past and projecting out into the future these visualizations are giving you for the first time in human history better than random predictions about what the weather will be like in week xe time or say that dream neighborhood you xe re thinking about moving to xe the one you can finally afford if you manage to get that raise xe happens to sit in flood zone and you think about what it might be like to live through significant flood event years from now as the climate becomes increasingly unpredictable that you xe re even contemplating that possibility is almost entirely thanks to the long term simulations of climate supercomputers metabolizing the planet xe deep past into its distant future
accurate weather forecasting is merely one early triumph of software based time travel algorithms that allow us to peer into the future in ways that were impossible just few decades ago what new book by trio of university of toronto economists calls xe cprediction machines xe in machine learning systems algorithms can be trained to generate remarkably accurate predictions of future events by combing through vast repositories of data from past events an algorithm might be trained to predict future mortgage defaults by analyzing thousands of home purchases and the financial profiles of the buyers testing its hypotheses by tracking which of those buyers ultimately defaulted result of that training would not be an infallible prediction of course but something similar to the predictions we rely on with weather forecasts range of probabilities that time traveling exercise in which you imagine buying house in the neighborhood with the great schools could be augmented by software prediction as well the algorithm might warn you that there was percent chance that your home purchase would end catastrophically because of market crash or hurricane or another algorithm trained on different data set might suggest other neighborhoods where home values are also likely to increase
these algorithms can help correct critical flaw in the default network human beings are famously bad at thinking probabilistically the pioneering cognitive psychologist amos tversky once joked that where probability is concerned humans have three default settings xe cgonna happen xe xe cnot gonna happen xe and xe cmaybe xe we are brilliant at floating imagined scenarios and evaluating how they might make us feel were they to happen but distinguishing between percent chance of something happening and percent chance doesn xe come naturally to us algorithms can help us compensate for that cognitive blind spot
machine learning systems will also be immensely helpful when mulling decisions that potentially involve large number of distinct options humans are remarkably adept at building imagined futures for few competing timelines simultaneously the one in which you take the new job the one in which you turn it down but our minds run up against computational ceiling when they need to track dozens or hundreds of future trajectories the prediction machines of do not have that limitation which will make them tantalizingly adept at assisting with some meaningful subset of important life decisions in which there is rich training data and high number of alternate futures to analyze
choosing where to go to college xe decision almost no human being had to make years ago that more than third of the planet now does xe happens to be decision that resides squarely in the machine learning sweet spot there are more than colleges and universities in the united states great majority of them are obviously inappropriate for any individual candidate but no matter where you are on the ladder of academic achievement xe and economic privilege xe there are undoubtedly more than few dozen candidate colleges that might well lead to interesting outcomes for you you can visit handful of them and listen to the wisdom of your advisers and consult the college experts online or in their handbooks but the algorithm would be scanning much larger set of options looking at data from millions of applications college transcripts dropout rates all the information that can be gleaned from the social media presence of college students which is today just about everything it would also scan parallel data set that the typical college adviser rarely emphasizes successful career paths that bypassed college from that training set it could generate dozens of separate predictions for promising colleges optimized to whatever rough goals the applicant defined self reported long term happiness financial security social justice impact fame health to be clear that data will be abused sold off to advertisers or stolen by cyberthieves it will generate thousand appropriately angry op eds but it will also most likely work on some basic level to the best that we xe ll be able to measure some people will swear by it others will renounce it either way it xe coming
in late the crime lab at the university of chicago announced new collaboration with the chicago police department to build machine learning based xe cofficer support system xe designed specifically to predict which officers are likely to have an xe cadverse incident xe on the job the algorithm sifts through the prodigious repository of data generated by every cop on the beat in chicago arrest reports gun confiscations public complaints supervisor reprimands and more the algorithm uses archived data xe coupled with actual cases of adverse incidents like the shooting of an unarmed citizen or other excessive uses of force xe as training set enabling it to detect patterns of information that can predict future problems
this sort of predictive technology immediately conjures images of xe cminority report xe style dystopia in which the machines convict you of precrime that by definition hasn xe happened yet but the project lead jens ludwig points out that with predictive system like the one currently in the works in chicago the immediate consequence would simply be an officer xe getting some additional support or counseling to help avert larger crisis xe cpeople get understandably nervous about making the final decision xe ludwig says xe cbut we don xe envision that would be making the decision xe instead he imagines it as xe cdecision making aid xe xe an algorithm that xe ccan help sergeants prioritize their attention xe
no matter how careful the chicago is in deploying this particular technology we shouldn xe sugarcoat the broader implications here it seems inevitable that people will be fired thanks to the predictive insights of machine learning algorithms and something about that prospect is intuitively disturbing to many of us yet we xe re already making consequential decisions about people xe whom to hire whom to fire whom to listen to whom to ignore xe based on human biases that we know to be at best unreliable at worst prejudiced if it seems creepy to imagine that we would make them based on data analyzing algorithms the decision making status quo relying on our meanest instincts may well be far creepier
whether you find the idea of augmenting the default network thrilling or terrifying one thing should be clear these tools are headed our way in the coming decade many of us will draw on the forecasts of machine learning to help us muddle through all kinds of life decisions career changes financial planning hiring choices these enhancements could well turn out to be the next leap forward in the evolution of homo prospectus allowing us to see into the future with more acuity xe and with more nuanced sense of probability xe than we can do on our own but even in that optimistic situation the power embedded in these new algorithms will be extraordinary which is why ludwig and many other members of the community have begun arguing for the creation of open source algorithms not unlike the open protocols of the original internet and world wide web drawing on predictive algorithms to shape important personal or civic decisions will be challenging enough without the process xe potentially being compromised or subtly redirected by the dictates of advertisers if you thought russian troll farms were dangerous in our social media feeds imagine what will happen when they infiltrate our daydreams
today it seems mind wandering is under attack from all sides it xe common complaint that our compulsive use of smartphones is destroying our ability to focus but seen through the lens of homo prospectus ubiquitous computing poses different kind of threat having network connected supercomputer in your pocket at all times gives you too much to focus on it cuts into your mind wandering time the downtime between cognitively active tasks that once led to rest states can now be filled with instagram or nasdaq updates or podcasts we have twitter timelines instead of time travel at the same time society wide vogue for xe cmindfulness xe encourages us to be in the moment to think of nothing at all instead of letting our thoughts wander search youtube and there are hundreds of meditation videos teaching you how to stop your mind from doing what it does naturally the homo prospectus theory suggests that if anything we need to carve out time in our schedule xe and perhaps even in our schools xe to let minds drift
according to marcus raichle at washington university it may not be too late to repair whatever damage we may have done to our prospective powers few early studies suggest that the neurons implicated in the default network have genetic profiles that are often associated with long term brain plasticity that most treasured of neural attributes xe cthe brain xe default mode network appears to preserve the capacity for plasticity into adulthood xe he told me plasticity of course is just another way of saying that the network can learn new tricks if these new studies pan out our mind wandering skills will not have been locked into place in our childhood we can get better at daydreaming if we give ourselves the time to do it
what will happen to our own time traveling powers as we come to rely more on the prediction machines of the outcome may be terrifying or liberating or some strange hybrid of the two right now it seems inevitable that will transform our prospective powers in meaningful new ways for better or for worse but it would be nice to think that all the technology that helped us understand the default network in the first place also ended up pushing us back to our roots giving our minds more time to wander to slip the surly bonds of now to be out of the moment

hardware innovations nope instead google is emphasizing software improvements xe particularly for images xe with its newest pixel smartphones
by brian chen
apple and samsung typically show off glitzy hardware innovations xe dual lens cameras bigger screens xe to mesmerize millions into buying their new smartphones google has taken different approach it wants to sell people on better software
that was abundantly clear with the pixel the search giant xe latest smartphone with software features powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning when you take blurry photo for example the pixel xe camera software can capture series of alternate images and look for clearer shot when you get call from an unknown number you can use screening tool to determine if it is robocall recommend using this feature with caution xe more on that later
xe cthe phone is powered by so that we let pixel do really useful delightful things xe said mario queiroz google xe vice president of pixel hardware xe cthe phone doesn xe get in the way things just happen for you xe
the pixel which will be available on thursday is modest piece of hardware otherwise it comes in two screen sizes xe inches and inches xe that are slightly smaller than phones from apple and samsung the smaller pixel costs the larger one is
the screen technology is oled which offers better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor lcd the rear camera has single lens because google felt its powered camera software was so good that it didn xe need to add second one like other high end phones the pixel is water resistant and its body is composed of glass to support wireless power charging feature that have found marginally useful
after testing the pixel for four days xe convinced that google did the right thing by emphasizing its software the pixel is superior android phone to samsung xe top rated galaxy devices thanks largely to google xe clever camera and intuitive interface
but wouldn xe say that the new pixel has the all around best camera xe prefer the iphone camera xe more lifelike colors still the pixel xe software smarts offer some advantages like the ability to take superior photos with the bokeh effect which puts the picture xe main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background
here xe what found about the pixel xe most important features
let xe say you take photo of group of people and one person blinks using google xe new photo optimization tool top shot there xe chance you can salvage that photo by choosing better shot with that person xe eyes open
to use top shot you turn on feature called motion photos which are essentially three second videos capturing the moments just before and after you take shot when you snap picture google xe camera software can analyze those before and after moments for better image to recommend
google xe theory is that top shot will change the way people take photos instead of snapping several shots of the same subject and manually picking the best one users could instead shoot single motion photo and then let google suggest the best image
for me top shot didn xe profoundly improve my photos or change my habits for example in park still took half dozen photos of my dogs until they both smiled at the camera but when reviewed my favorite photo google recommended two different shots as potential top shot xe and did pick the one where the dogs xe faces looked clear
it xe impressive that google is capable of detecting the qualities of good photo but found the process of reviewing and selecting the recommended shots to be time consuming it was quicker to use the old technique of snapping bunch of photos and manually swiping through them to decide which you like most
in other words for now don xe consider this must have feature
better reason to consider the pixel is its impressive ability to take so called portrait mode photos those dslr like images with gently blurred background and sharpened foreground
this effect is useful for producing artistic looking photos of people food and objects portrait mode is the pixel xe strength compared with both samsung xe galaxy phones and apple xe high end iphones which use dual lens cameras to take portrait mode photos the single lens pixel camera was more reliable at sharpening the intended subject
here xe an example when had dim sum for lunch and used the pixel xe portrait mode to snap photo of five soup dumplings inside basket the camera appropriately sharpened the five dumplings while blurring out my partner in the background when took portrait mode photo with the iphone xs the camera blurred out one of the five dumplings eventually got the iphone camera to sharpen all five dumplings with few more tries but the pixel did it in one attempt
it xe remarkable that the pixel can produce these images with single lens google accomplished this largely with what is known as machine learning which involved computers analyzing millions of images to recognize what xe important in photo the pixel makes predictions about the parts of the photo that should stay sharp and creates mask around it special sensor inside the camera called dual pixel autofocus helps analyze the distance between the objects and the camera to make the blurring look realistic
having this smart camera xe which has the potential to become even smarter through software updates xe is compelling reason to consider the pixel google said it planned to add more camera features in those updates like night sight which helps people take photos in the dark without using flash
xe cwhat we xe ve been able to do with machine learning to produce image quality in photography and video it really surpasses the need for us to do more xe mr queiroz said
nowadays it can feel daunting to take phone call from an unfamiliar number because it is most likely robocall xe scammer or spammer using an automated dialing system to steal your personal information or to sell you something to fight robocalls google built screening tool into the pixel
beware using this feature comes with some risk
the screening tool works by tapping button when you want to screen call an automated message will ask the caller to state his or her name and purpose for calling from there the user can receive transcription of the caller xe response and decide whether to take the call
the tool works well screened call from my partner and google did perfect job at immediately transcribing her response xe cmy purpose is to eat dumplings so leave me alone xe
but be wary about using this tool the no rule when dealing with robocalls is to not answer them according to the federal communications commission the no rule is to hang up immediately if you do answer robocall that xe because picking up the phone or engaging with the caller indicates that your phone number is active which could land you on list to be flooded with even more robocalls
it unclear if using the tool would count as engaging with the robocaller google said that in its testing it did not see an increase in spam calls after the screening feature was used the company said the alternative xe to ignore all unknown numbers xe was not feasible because calls could be coming in from doctors delivery drivers restaurants and service providers
it remains to be seen how effective the screening tool will be when pixel customers use it en masse still think the safer xe although imperfect xe solution is to not answer calls from suspicious numbers like those that are nearly identical to yours
after all the tests here xe the short version of who should buy pixel you should get one if what you care about most is having phone with great camera that does the best job of running google xe android software
but don xe recommend messing with the robocallers the bots will always win

we need to identify disqualify and regulate chatbots before they destroy political speech
by jamie susskind
mr susskind is lawyer
as we survey the fallout from the midterm elections it would be easy to miss the longer term threats to democracy that are waiting around the corner perhaps the most serious is political artificial intelligence in the form of automated xe cchatbots xe which masquerade as humans and try to hijack the political process
chatbots are software programs that are capable of conversing with human beings on social media using natural language increasingly they take the form of machine learning systems that are not painstakingly xe ctaught xe vocabulary grammar and syntax but rather xe clearn xe to respond appropriately using probabilistic inference from large data sets together with some human guidance
some chatbots like the award winning mitsuku can hold passable levels of conversation politics however is not mitsuku xe strong suit when asked xe cwhat do you think of the midterms xe mitsuku replies xe ci have never heard of midterms please enlighten me xe reflecting the imperfect state of the art mitsuku will often give answers that are entertainingly weird asked xe cwhat do you think of the new york times xe mitsuku replies xe ci didn xe even know there was new one xe
most political bots these days are similarly crude limited to the repetition of slogans like xe lockherup xe or xe maga xe but glance at recent political history suggests that chatbots have already begun to have an appreciable impact on political discourse in the buildup to the midterms for instance an estimated percent of the online chatter relating to xe cthe caravan xe of central american migrants was initiated by chatbots
in the days following the disappearance of the columnist jamal khashoggi arabic language social media erupted in support for crown prince mohammed bin salman who was widely rumored to have ordered his murder on single day in october the phrase xe cwe all have trust in mohammed bin salman xe featured in tweets xe cwe have to stand by our leader xe was posted more than times along with messages imploring saudis to xe cunfollow enemies of the nation xe in all likelihood the majority of these messages were generated by chatbots
chatbots aren xe recent phenomenon two years ago around fifth of all tweets discussing the presidential election are believed to have been the work of chatbots and third of all traffic on twitter before the referendum on britain xe membership in the european union was said to come from chatbots principally in support of the leave side
it xe irrelevant that current bots are not xe csmart xe like we are or that they have not achieved the consciousness and creativity hoped for by purists what matters is their impact
in the past despite our differences we could at least take for granted that all participants in the political process were human beings this no longer true increasingly we share the online debate chamber with nonhuman entities that are rapidly growing more advanced this summer bot developed by the british firm babylon reportedly achieved score of percent in the clinical examination for admission to the royal college of general practitioners the average score for human doctors percent
if chatbots are approaching the stage where they can answer diagnostic questions as well or better than human doctors then it xe possible they might eventually reach or surpass our levels of political sophistication and it is na xc xafve to suppose that in the future bots will share the limitations of those we see today they xe ll likely have faces and voices names and personalities xe all engineered for maximum persuasion so called xe deep fake xe videos can already convincingly synthesize the speech and appearance of real politicians
unless we take action chatbots could seriously endanger our democracy and not just when they go haywire
the most obvious risk is that we are crowded out of our own deliberative processes by systems that are too fast and too ubiquitous for us to keep up with who would bother to join debate where every contribution is ripped to shreds within seconds by thousand digital adversaries
related risk is that wealthy people will be able to afford the best chatbots prosperous interest groups and corporations whose views already enjoy dominant place in public discourse will inevitably be in the best position to capitalize on the rhetorical advantages afforded by these new technologies
and in world where increasingly the only feasible way of engaging in debate with chatbots is through the deployment of other chatbots also possessed of the same speed and facility the worry is that in the long run we xe ll become effectively excluded from our own party to put it mildly the wholesale automation of deliberation would be an unfortunate development in democratic history
recognizing the threat some groups have begun to act the oxford internet institute xe computational propaganda project provides reliable scholarly research on bot activity around the world innovators at robhat labs now offer applications to reveal who is human and who is not and social media platforms themselves xe twitter and facebook among them xe have become more effective at detecting and neutralizing bots
but more needs to be done
blunt approach xe call it disqualification xe would be an all out prohibition of bots on forums where important political speech takes place and punishment for the humans responsible the bot disclosure and accountability bill introduced by senator dianne feinstein democrat of california proposes something similar it would amend the federal election campaign act of to prohibit candidates and political parties from using any bots intended to impersonate or replicate human activity for public communication it would also stop pacs corporations and labor organizations from using bots to disseminate messages advocating candidates which would be considered xe celectioneering communications xe
subtler method would involve mandatory identification requiring all chatbots to be publicly registered and to state at all times the fact that they are chatbots and the identity of their human owners and controllers again the bot disclosure and accountability bill would go some way to meeting this aim requiring the federal trade commission to force social media platforms to introduce policies requiring users to provide xe cclear and conspicuous notice xe of bots xe cin plain and clear language xe and to police breaches of that rule the main onus would be on platforms to root out transgressors
we should also be exploring more imaginative forms of regulation why not introduce rule coded into platforms themselves that bots may make only up to specific number of online contributions per day or specific number of responses to particular human bots peddling suspect information could be challenged by moderator bots to provide recognized sources for their claims within seconds those that fail would face removal
we need not treat the speech of chatbots with the same reverence that we treat human speech moreover bots are too fast and tricky to be subject to ordinary rules of debate for both those reasons the methods we use to regulate bots must be more robust than those we apply to people there can be no half measures when democracy is at stake

imagine this when you leave the house your air conditioner and lights turn off automatically then when motion sensor detects person in the house like your house cleaner it sends an alert to your phone when you arrive home camera recognizes who you are and the door automatically unlocks
automated technologies like these will be at the forefront of ces one of the world xe largest tech conventions next week in las vegas they underline one major trend increasingly the innovations that are making their way into your personal technology aren xe physical electronics or gadgets at all
the real star is artificial intelligence the culmination of software algorithms and sensors working together to make your everyday appliances smarter and more automated it is that is telling the door to unlock when the camera recognizes you or sending an alert to your phone when sensors detect person
xe cit xe less about the hardware and more about what xe inside xe carolina milanesi technology analyst for creative strategies said about the prominence of artificial intelligence and software innovations at ces for consumers who are dazzled by flashy new devices is never as exciting she said xe but it xe the magic that is making hardware evolve
that artificial intelligence will take center stage at ces also speaks to how the event has changed in the last few years it has become less of venue for tech companies to unveil splashy new products like smartphones or computers and instead has turned into showcase for nascent technologies
here are some highlights you can expect from next week xe show
alexa amazon xe intelligent assistant that listens to your voice commands to play music order diapers and place phone call will be everywhere at ces
smaller tech companies have teamed up with amazon to bring voice controlled smarts to their products devices like light bulbs car stereo accessories robovacuums home security systems and even coffee makers will work with alexa in addition thousands of companies have developed xe cskills xe or third party apps that work with alexa voice commands sonos premium audio brand recently released speaker with alexa functionality built in
what xe fueling interest in alexa amazon xe success with echo the smart speakers enabled with the personal assistant amazon said last month that it sold tens of millions of echo devices over the holiday season strategy analytics research firm estimates that percent of voice controlled speakers sold last year worked with alexa
other tech giants want piece of the pie too in google introduced home an artificially intelligent speaker to rival the echo the search giant will have large presence at ces where the company is also expected to highlight accessories that work with its home speaker and google assistant
apple this year will release homepod speaker that relies on siri the apple assistant to control some smart home accessories and samsung electronics the south korean manufacturer is expected to unveil major upgrade for bixby its virtual assistant later this year
xe cif had to make bet it xe the year of and conversational interfaces xe said gownder an analyst for forrester research
nowadays it xe easy to shop for high quality internet connected home accessories like light bulbs thermostats and security cameras at ces samsung is even planning to introduce smart refrigerator at the electronics show that can listen to voice commands to control other home accessories
now tech companies are looking to push internet connectivity beyond products in your home
consider parking spaces that can sense whether cars are occupying them and can then alert people when spots free up or garbage can that can notify waste collection facility when the container is full or street lamps planted throughout city that could monitor air quality
xe cyou xe ve seen the smart home xe mr gownder said xe cthe smart city is elevating that to the next level xe
deloitte the consulting firm has been making big push for smart cities it envisions future where multitude of sensors work together to create healthier safer and more energy efficient town sensors in river could detect pollution like leaks from chemical plants and sensors that detect the sound of gunshot could be used to alert the police for example
next week companies will demonstrate prototypes of devices embedded with some of these sensors with the hope that cities will soon begin adopting these technologies within their infrastructure
self driving car enthusiasts like elon musk the chief executive of tesla dream of future where driverless cars eliminate traffic accidents while letting people do work on their commutes
they can keep dreaming autonomous vehicles still have long way to go before they become safe and properly regulated
xe cyour car doesn xe drive itself at least not reliably for long period of time xe said ms milanesi of creative strategies
still at ces carmakers like ford hyundai bmw and audi are expected to show off the latest improvements to self driving tech like smarter parking assistance and less error prone collision avoidance these are baby steps toward truly driverless vehicles but some features may appear in cars in the coming years
likely coming sooner is the so called connected car tech and car companies will demonstrate new features for internet equipped cars like the ability to pay for parking and gas through dashboard or cameras that enhance driver xe side and rear vision at the trade show gentex corporation company that develops car technology will demonstrate in vehicle biometrics that scan driver xe iris to verify his or her identity before turning on the car
as growing number of devices rely on artificial intelligence they will require faster bandwidth speeds at ces wireless companies like at amp and verizon are expected to give progress reports on so called the fifth generation network technology
with wireless carriers envision an era of incredibly fast speeds that let smartphone users download movie in less than five seconds xe roughly times faster than the current network technology even more important is expected to greatly reduce latency to let devices communicate with each other with extremely fast response times
one caveat the wireless industry is not expected to roll out until telecom equipment makers and tech companies are still fighting over which of their technologies should be standardized globally
so why should you care all of the above xe the smart city the driverless car and smarter artificial intelligence xe will need extremely fast response times for devices to work reliably the chief example is driverless cars which will have to communicate with each other practically in real time to avoid collisions
xe cit could be foundational to the next generation of advancements xe said greg roberts an executive at accenture tech consulting firm xe cyou xe re going to see more talk around the potential of to remove the barriers around bandwidth xe

the retail industry is doubling down on digital to keep its unexpectedly strong holiday performance from becoming fluke
the floor of the national retail federation xe annual trade show in new york this week was crowded with alert systems primed to recognize heavy spending customers so called smart shelves fitted with real time inventory trackers and robots for every step of the supply chain
it was conference about shopping that looked more like an expo for tech as if the electronics trade show ces had decamped from las vegas and moved to the javits center in manhattan
the retail federation said last week that total sales in november and december made their largest leap since surging percent from year earlier on tuesday adobe analytics reported that online sales over the same period grew by percent to new high of billion with mobile revenue booming percent
at the three day event xe which drew more than exhibitors and featured sessions with top executives from walmart best buy neiman marcus and other major companies xe discussions of artificial intelligence big data and automation filled stages and meeting booths modeled after fitting rooms
commerce was both an aspiration and boogeyman amazon was often described in hushed tones several exhibitors and speakers tried to avoid naming the online retailer at all
but attendees packed large hall on tuesday to listen to an executive of alibaba chinese giant that many consider to be amazon xe chief rival describe how asian consumers are eager to make purchases enabled by technology
china xe cmay well become the first cashless society in the future xe said lee mccabe vice president of alibaba xe north america operations shoppers in china largely accept alibaba xe voracious data collection which allows the company to create detailed behavioral profiles across its many platforms
alibaba uses the information to help guide american brands like mattel into china mr mccabe said to promote movies like xe ca dog xe purpose xe to an asian audience alibaba xe ctargeted everybody who likes dennis quaid movies who likes dogs who has watched dog video xe using its vast trove of data he said
artificial intelligence also plays heavily into alibaba xe strategy and is used to predict supply chain volatility and personalize marketing it also handles percent of the inquiries the company receives from its customers the system recognizes when shoppers become emotional and should be transferred to human representative mr mccabe said
certain consumers will soon be able to test drive or purchase vehicles without any human contact using their mobile phones at garage that doubles as vending machine he said alibaba will have reviewed their credit scores and deemed them able to afford car
embracing technologies and quickly is crucial to survival as consumers grow more demanding according to panel of venture capital professionals
xe cthe consumer expectation of frictionless shopping experience is here xe said scott friend managing director of bain capital ventures
digitally native companies are emerging and growing faster catching up can be difficult for large legacy chains which have struggled to project enough cool factor to recruit in demand employees

tech we xe re using
by the new york times
how do new york times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives nellie bowles technology reporter in san francisco discussed the tech she xe using
as our tech culture reporter what is your most crucial tech tool for doing work
there xe only one gadget can xe live without it weighs in at pounds it is my desk treadmill
can never sit still get nervous twitchy energy when try xe ve used standing desk since my first job out of college in but got my treadmill the lifespan tr about six months ago and life on it is truly my ideal state
the treadmill goes under my desk walk usually miles an hour but drop to mile an hour for writing something tricky xe ll kick up to miles an hour if xe feeling wild or on long call if xe transcribing or doing something that doesn xe require tons of decision making xe ll do miles an hour but that xe the max and stay like that all day long and that xe how work
how did you decide to get treadmill desk
for me the game of work is always how long each day can keep my mind sharp and absorbed in the task at hand find walking to be very good for this but logistically for my job need to be typing notes during calls and writing up stories so discovered the treadmill desk my mind doesn xe flit around as much when xe treading
it also just feels good think it xe strange that from very young age we xe re all expected to cram our bodies around these squat little tables and then remain stock still for hours on end
how did your colleagues react to it
moved the treadmill into the office on sunday evening so when everyone got in monday it would just be fact of life were there jokes many jokes but we xe re goldfish and get used to new items and the trick is that bringing up the treadmill now is actually worse because then xe ll start rambling about some new treadmill desk health study and how xe going to live forever so we xe ve reached silent truce
xe in an open plan office and my desk neighbor jack nicas who covers apple said he was little concerned that would be looming half foot off the ground walking miles day straight at him
xe cbut it xe kind of soothing now xe he said during recent interview conducted while treading directly at him and typing this xe cit xe also giving me this intense self loathing sitting here while you xe re walking all day xe
great
you write about lot of trends permeating silicon valley like scooters cryptokitties and wool shoes what trends do you think will actually last
wool shoes
will be honest the commerce wool shoe market niche is lot bigger than had imagined pared down commerce basics shops like everlane and allbirds are interesting to watch though think amazon might eat them all there will be good stories in what people do with storefronts instead of selling things
electric city vehicles are here to stay in terms of shape since batteries have gotten cheaper and better the form factor of the electric bike big with pedals hard in skirt has become less necessary scooters are light and fun and god help me they look cool
the biggest shift will be when we get self driving cars but that xe kind of obvious
some of the trends here virtual reality blockchain get comically overhyped but that xe actually my favorite part of silicon valley culture xe the blind exuberance and goofiness and the kids who flood in from around the world grew up in san francisco but it was the start up boomtown vibe that made me want to stay here to write
outside work what tech product do you love what xe so great about it and what could be better
use small portable purple bluetooth speaker the ue roll for outdoor hanging out and as my in room sound system it is perfect there is nothing that could be better about it
to deal with your smartphone addiction you grayed out your smartphone screen how is that working out for you
love it it gives me sense of control over something felt had too much power and that is small daily satisfaction
these phones are designed to look and work like slot machines xe hit us with bright colors and little pings to activate and please xe and xe glad to have scrubbed some of that my computer screen is grayscale as well
to step back as our screen worlds have gotten better and so deeply immersive we all have to figure out little hooks to pull back into the physical world assuming we want to be pulled back for me for now good hook is color xe the world is colorful and my screens are gray

student opinion
by natalie proulx
the robot future is here from automated personal assistants like siri and alexa to security bots self driving cars algorithms and holograms robots and other artificially intelligent machines are already embedded in our daily lives
what day to day interactions do you have with robots how do you feel about the presence of artificial intelligence in your personal life community or society at large why
in xe why do we hurt robots xe jonah engel bromwich writes about wave of violence against intelligent machines
hitchhiking robot was beheaded in philadelphia security robot was punched to the ground in silicon valley another security bot in san francisco was covered in tarp and smeared with barbecue sauce
why do people lash out at robots particularly those that are built to resemble humans it xe global phenomenon in mall in osaka japan three boys beat humanoid robot with all their strength in moscow man attacked teaching robot named alantim with baseball bat kicking it to the ground while the robot pleaded for help
why do we act this way are we secretly terrified that robots will take our jobs upend our societies control our every move with their ever expanding capabilities and air of quiet malice
quite possibly the specter of insurrection is embedded in the word xe crobot xe itself it was first used to refer to automatons by the czech playwright karel capek who repurposed word that had referred to system of indentured servitude or serfdom the feudal fear of peasant revolt was transplanted to mechanical servants and worries of robot uprising have lingered ever since xe xa
but agnieszka wykowska cognitive neuroscientist researcher at the italian institute of technology and the editor in chief of the international journal of social robotics said that while human antagonism toward robots has different forms and motivations it often resembles the ways that humans hurt each other robot abuse she said might stem from the tribal psychology of insiders and outsiders
xe cyou have an agent the robot that is in different category than humans xe she said xe cso you probably very easily engage in this psychological mechanism of social ostracism because it xe an out group member that xe something to discuss the dehumanization of robots even though they xe re not humans xe
paradoxically our tendency to dehumanize robots comes from the instinct to anthropomorphize them william santana li the chief executive of knightscope the largest provider of security robots in the united states two of which were battered in san francisco said that while he avoids treating his products as if they were sentient beings his clients seem unable to help themselves xe cour clients significant majority end up naming the machines themselves xe he said xe cthere xe holmes and watson there xe rosie there xe steve there xe cb there xe cx po xe
students read the entire article then tell us
xe have you ever felt anger fear or hatred toward robots like that described in the article have you ever witnessed someone abuse or have you yourself abused machine
xe the article gives several explanations for why humans hurt robots which are the most convincing to you and why what theories do you have for why humans may mistreat machines
xe how do you feel about an automated future do you fear countless professions becoming obsolete the merging of humans and machines an age of artificial intimacy or potential robot uprising or are you excited about all the possibilities such future could hold explain why you feel the way you do
xe some say that anthropomorphizing robots xe for example giving them names and getting to know them xe encourages humans to be kinder to them do you think we should treat robots like people what are the benefits of doing so what are the dangers
xe how do you think relationships between robots and humans should be governed should people be imprisoned for robot abuse should artificially intelligent machines be protected under the law in the same way we are where do we draw the line between human and machine xe if we draw one at all

as reporters and editors find themselves the victims of layoffs at digital publishers and traditional newspaper chains alike journalism generated by machine is on the rise
roughly third of the content published by bloomberg news uses some form of automated technology the system used by the company cyborg is able to assist reporters in churning out thousands of articles on company earnings reports each quarter
the program can dissect financial report the moment it appears and spit out an immediate news story that includes the most pertinent facts and figures and unlike business reporters who find working on that kind of thing snooze it does so without complaint
untiring and accurate cyborg helps bloomberg in its race against reuters its main rival in the field of quick twitch business financial journalism as well as giving it fighting chance against more recent player in the information race hedge funds which use artificial intelligence to serve their clients fresh facts
xe cthe financial markets are ahead of others in this xe said john micklethwait the editor in chief of bloomberg
in addition to covering company earnings for bloomberg robot reporters have been prolific producers of articles on minor league baseball for the associated press high school football for the washington post and earthquakes for the los angeles times
examples of machine generated articles from the associated press
tysons corner va ap xe microstrategy inc mstr on tuesday reported fourth quarter net income of million after reporting loss in the same period year earlier
manchester ap xe jonathan davis hit for the cycle as the new hampshire fisher cats topped the portland sea dogs on tuesday
last week the guardian xe australia edition published its first machine assisted article an account of annual political donations to the country xe political parties and forbes recently announced that it was testing tool called bertie to provide reporters with rough drafts and story templates
as the use of artificial intelligence has become part of the industry xe toolbox journalism executives say it is not threat to human employees rather the idea is to allow journalists to spend more time on substantive work
xe cthe work of journalism is creative it xe about curiosity it xe about storytelling it xe about digging and holding governments accountable it xe critical thinking it xe judgment xe and that is where we want our journalists spending their energy xe said lisa gibbs the director of news partnerships for the
the was an early adopter when it struck deal in with automated insights technology company specializing in language generation software that produces billions of machine generated stories year
in addition to leaning on the software to generate minor league and college game stories the like bloomberg has used it to beef up its coverage of company earnings reports since joining forces with automated insights the has gone from producing articles on earnings reports per quarter to
the post has an in house robot reporter called heliograf which demonstrated its usefulness with its coverage of the summer olympic games and the elections last year thanks to heliograf the post won in the category of excellence in use of bots at the annual global biggies awards which recognize accomplishments in the use of big data and artificial intelligence as if to make journalists jittery the biggies ceremony took place at columbia university xe pulitzer hall
jeremy gilbert the director of strategic initiatives at the post said the company also used to promote articles with local orientation in topics like political races to readers in specific regions xe practice known as geo targeting
xe cwhen you start to talk about mass media with national or international reach you run the risk of losing the interest of readers who are interested in stories on their smaller communities xe mr gilbert said xe cso we asked xe how can we scale our expertise xe xe
the the post and bloomberg have also set up internal alerts to signal anomalous bits of data reporters who see the alert can then determine if there is bigger story to be written by human being during the olympics for instance the post set up alerts on slack the workplace messaging system to inform editors if result was percent above or below an olympic world record
journalism is not as simple as shiny robot banging out copy lot of work goes into the front end with editors and writers meticulously crafting several versions of story complete with text for different outcomes once the data is in xe for weather event baseball game or an earnings report xe the system can create an article
but machine generated stories are not infallible for an earnings report article for instance software systems may meet their match in companies that cleverly choose figures in an effort to garner more favorable portrayal than the numbers warrant at bloomberg reporters and editors try to prepare cyborg so that it will not be spun by such tactics
in newsrooms may also go beyond the production of rote articles
xe ci hope we xe ll see tools become productivity tool in the practice of reporting and finding clues xe said hilary mason the general manager for machine learning at cloudera data management software company xe cwhen you do data analysis you can see anomalies and patterns using and human journalist is the right person to understand and figure out xe
the wall street journal and dow jones are experimenting with the technology to help with various tasks including the transcription of interviews or helping journalists identify xe cdeep fakes xe the convincingly fabricated images generated through
xe cmaybe few years ago was this new shiny technology used by high tech companies but now it xe actually becoming necessity xe said francesco marconi the head of research and development at the journal xe ci think lot of the tools in journalism will soon by powered by artificial intelligence xe
the new york times said it had no plans for machine generated news articles but the company has experimented with using to personalize newsletters help with comment moderation and identify images as it digitizes its archive
previous technological advances have rendered moot number of jobs that were once essential to the journalism industry such as linotype operator but reporters and editors have not yet been tempted to smash the programs now taking care of some of the busy work that once fell to them
xe cwhen you look at the ways things are laid out and printed and produced and distributed lot of those functions have been replaced with technology xe said nastaran mohit the organizing director for the news guild of new york she added that she did not consider threat to newsroom workers while also noting that the guild monitors emerging technologies to make sure that hypothesis holds true
mr marconi of the journal agreed likening the addition of in newsrooms to the introduction of the telephone xe cit gives you more access and you get more information quicker xe he said xe cit xe new field but technology changes today it xe tomorrow it xe blockchain and in years it will be something else what does not change is the journalistic standard xe
marc zionts the chief executive of automated insights said that machines were long way from being able to replace flesh and blood reporters and editors he added that his daughter was journalist in south dakota xe and although he had not advised her to leave her job he had told her to get acquainted with the latest technology
xe cif you are non learning non adaptive person xe don xe care what business you xe re in xe you will have challenging career xe mr zionts said

study featured on xe minutes xe is sure to alarm parents here xe what scientists know and don xe know about the link between screens behavior and development
by benedict carey
generation ago parents worried about the effects of tv before that it was radio now the concern is xe cscreen time xe catchall term for the amount of time that children especially preteens and teenagers spend interacting with tvs computers smartphones digital pads and video games this age group draws particular attention because screen immersion rises sharply during adolescence and because brain development accelerates then too as neural networks are pruned and consolidated in the transition to adulthood
on sunday evening cbs xe xe minutes xe reported on early results from the study for adolescent brain cognitive development million project financed by the national institutes of health the study aims to reveal how brain development is affected by range of experiences including substance use concussions and screen time as part of an expos xc xa on screen time xe minutes xe reported that heavy screen use was associated with lower scores on some aptitude tests and to accelerated xe ccortical thinning xe natural process xe in some children but the data is preliminary and it xe unclear whether the effects are lasting or even meaningful
yes but so does every other activity that children engage in sleep homework playing soccer arguing growing up in poverty reading vaping behind the school the adolescent brain continually changes or xe crewires xe itself in response to daily experience and that adaptation continues into the early to mid
what scientists want to learn is whether screen time at some threshold causes any measurable differences in adolescent brain structure or function and whether those differences are meaningful do they cause attention deficits mood problems or delays in reading or problem solving ability
like the science times page on facebook sign up for the science times newsletter
not convincingly more than scientific reports and surveys have studied screen habits and well being in young people looking for emotional and behavioral differences as well as changes in attitude such as in body image in scientists from queen xe university belfast reviewed of the best designed such studies the studies found that social networking allows people to broaden their circle of social contacts in ways that could be both good and bad for instance by exposing young people to abusive content the review xe authors concluded that there was xe can absence of robust causal research regarding the impact of social media on the mental well being of young people xe in short results have been mixed and sometimes contradictory
psychologists have also examined whether playing violent video games is connected to aggressive behavior more than such studies have been carried out some researchers found links others have not one challenge in studying this and other aspects of screen time is identifying the direction of causality do children who play lot of violent video games become more aggressive as result or were they drawn to such content because they were more aggressive from the start
even if scientists found strong evidence of single measurable effect xe if say three hours of daily screen time was associated with heightened risk of being diagnosed with xe such clear association wouldn xe necessarily suggest there were any consistent measurable differences in brain structure
individual variation is the rule in brain development the size of specific brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex the rate at which those regions edit and consolidate their networks and the variations in these parameters from person to person make it very difficult to interpret findings to address such obstacles scientists need huge numbers of research subjects and far better understanding of the brain
yes the ongoing study expects to follow children through adolescence with annual magnetic resonance imaging to see if changes in the brain are linked to behavior or health the study began in recruiting academic research centers and initially focused on the effects of drug and alcohol use on the adolescent brain since then the project has expanded and now includes other targets such as the effects of brain injury screen time genetics and an array of xe cother environmental factors xe
the recently published paper covered by xe minutes xe provided an early glimpse of the anticipated results research team based at the university of california san diego analyzed brain scans from more than preteens and correlated those with the children xe amount of screen time as reported by the children themselves in questionnaires and their scores on language and thinking tests the findings were mixed bag some heavy screen users showed cortical thinning at younger ages than expected but this thinning is part of natural brain maturation and scientists don xe know what that difference means some heavy users scored below the curve on aptitude tests others performed well
but the accuracy of self reported screen time estimates is hard to ascertain and the association between small differences in brain structure and how people actually behave is even more vague as result researchers effectively are multiplying one uncertain relationship by another and need to make statistical adjustments clear conclusions are extremely hard to come by and complicated by the fact that brain scan is no more than snapshot in time year from now some of the observed relationships could be reversed
the authors acknowledge as much xe cthis diversity of findings provides an important public health message that screen media activity is not simply bad for the brain or bad for brain related functioning xe they concluded
in other words the measured effects may be good or more likely not meaningful at all until further research demonstrates otherwise
it xe probably both bad and good for the brain depending on the individual and his or her viewing habits many people who are socially isolated as result of abuse personal quirks or developmental differences such as asperger xe syndrome establish social networks through their screens that would be impossible to find in person
disentangling negative consequences to physical brain development from positive ones will be enormously difficult given the many other factors potentially in play the effects of marijuana use drinking and vaping genetic differences changes at home or school and the entire emotional storm of adolescence
most parents are probably already aware of the biggest downside of screen time the extent to which it can displace other childhood experiences including sleep climbing over fences designing elaborate practical jokes and getting into trouble indeed many parents xe maybe most xe watched hours of tv day themselves as youngsters their experiences may be more similar to their children xe than they know

san francisco xe since uber started self driving car program in it has insisted on developing its own driverless technology and operating its own fleet of autonomous vehicles
now the ride hailing company is starting to shift away from that own it all strategy
uber is receiving new million investment from toyota which would value the company at billion according to person briefed on the deal who was not authorized to speak publicly with that investment uber plans to provide its self driving technology to fleet of toyota minivans which may be operated by the japanese automaker or third party the companies said in joint announcement
the fleet will also be equipped with toyota xe safety software called guardian and will pick up passengers on uber xe ride hailing network the companies anticipate starting pilot program by
xe cthis agreement and investment marks an important milestone in our transformation to mobility company as we help provide path for safe and secure expansion of mobility services like ride sharing that includes toyota vehicles and technologies xe shigeki tomoyama executive vice president of toyota motor said in statement toyota xe investment was reported earlier by the wall street journal
since dara khosrowshahi became chief executive of uber last year the company xe self driving program has been in state of flux and uber executives have been divided over whether to sell the business or keep it developing and operating driverless cars is expensive and mr khosrowshahi has been trying to trim back costs at the company in order to take uber public by the end of and in march self driving uber vehicle struck and killed pedestrian in arizona prompting the company to halt its testing there
but by teaming up with toyota uber can keep testing its driverless technology in cars without the expense and hassle of maintaining full fleet and owning the entire operation from top to bottom
xe ci think there xe going to be very large multibillion dollar businesses to be built on fleet operations xe jeff miller uber xe head of business development for strategic initiatives said in an interview although uber sees fleet operation as potentially lucrative for others mr miller said that market xe cis not where uber has long term interest in participating xe
uber currently owns sizable fleet of volvo cars that carry its self driving technology the self driving program is still undergoing comprehensive safety review as result of the fatal crash although the company continues limited testing of autonomous cars in pittsburgh
xe cover time uber will transition from the business model we have with volvo where we are owning and operating our fleet to this kind of partnership where uber is the technology provider xe mr miller said
uber is experimenting with several other business strategies around driverless cars including deal with the automaker daimler daimler is developing its own self driving technology for deployment on uber xe ride hailing service although the agreement is not exclusive and daimler could offer its vehicles with other ride hailing companies as well
in testing partnership approach uber is emulating strategy that lyft rival ride hailing provider is also pursuing
lyft has worked with several companies on self driving technology including collaborating with an autonomous developer aptiv to operate small fleet of self driving bmws in las vegas lyft has also worked with auto manufacturers like ford and general motors to develop and test autonomous vehicle designs and technology including putting self driving vehicles on lyft xe ride hailing network in the future
toyota and uber have worked together in the past in january at the international ces technology trade show toyota unveiled new driverless concept vehicle and said uber would be one of its partners alongside amazon and pizza hut
at the time mr khosrowshahi wrote on twitter that xe cpartnership is key element of our ride sharing autonomous strategy xe he added that he was xe clooking forward to working with team toyota to make it reality xe
an earlier version of this article using information from uber misstated the valuation of the ride hailing company it is billion not billion

in an era of skyrocketing smartphone prices it xe relief that apple xe iphone is just as powerful and nearly as capable as its counterparts our reviewer found
by brian chen
good news apple loyalists you won xe have to burn on your next iphone that xe because for about you can have the iphone xr which is just as fast and nearly as capable as its more expensive counterparts
the cheaper iphone which becomes available this friday is the model that most people should buy this year xe other iphones xe namely the xs and xs max devices which cost about and and are already in stores xe are luxury devices better suited for enthusiasts willing to spend premium for superior cameras or jumbo screen
for everyone else the xr is perfectly adequate and has few downsides its inch screen which is based on lcd an older display technology looks ever so slightly inferior to the oled screens on the xs phones xe but you would need to be movie buff to notice the difference
the xr xe single lens camera is also less capable than the dual lens cameras on the xs models yet the xr can still produce very satisfying photos of people using portrait mode also known as the bokeh effect which puts the picture xe main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background
the xr is slightly less durable than its more expensive cousins its glass back is not as tough as the one on the xs its casing or chassis is composed of aluminum instead of the more robust stainless steel on the costlier phones yet these differences are negligible recommend that people use case to protect those parts of the phone anyway carrying phone without case is bit like driving car without bumpers
all of these minor negatives add up to win for price conscious consumers especially as smartphone prices keep climbing xe iphones few years ago started at about while prices for android phones from google and samsung have also shot up to between and
after tested an xr for four days here are the highlights
apple developed new kind of lcd to improve color accuracy and squeeze the xr xe screen into the corners of the phone the result is what apple calls liquid retina display which looks better xe brighter and more vibrant xe than past iphone lcd screens
confess that struggled to see difference between the liquid retina screen and the oled on an iphone xs the distinction is most evident in blacks if you look at photo taken in the dark you will notice that the blacks on the xr xe screen have faint blue glow which is coming from the backlight used to illuminate the screen while the blacks on the xs look darker and more realistic because the oled technology turns off individual pixels to make them black
while browsing instagram on the xr and the xs came across few photos that clearly looked better on the xs xe oled screen one example was professional photo for new york times cooking article about cherry season in the photo which shows variety of cherries in colorful baskets the reds and cyans looked more accurate on the xs than on the xr and some of the red stains on the wood table were more visible on the xs
these downsides were trivial the vast majority of your time on phone will probably be spent looking at amateur photos taken by friends and family anyway so it xe worth saving to have this slightly less vibrant screen
if you are debating between an xs and xr your buying decision will probably come down to the camera the xr xe single lens camera takes excellent clear photos with lifelike colors but because it lacks second lens it is less capable at taking those dslr like portrait mode shots which are lot of fun
to do portrait mode with the xr xe single lens apple used machine learning which involves computers analyzing images to recognize people in the photo and properly sharpen them while blurring the background apple decided to limit its machine assisted image processing on the device specifically to human subjects
in contrast the second lens on the xs camera helped the device do portrait shots of wider variety of subjects like dogs and objects in addition to the help of machine learning the two lenses worked together to create depth of field effect that kept the main subject in sharp focus while blurring the background
when you attempt to take portrait photo of nonhuman the xr camera will display the message xe cno person detected xe this was the biggest downer to me as dog owner and foodie and what ultimately drove me to buy an xs
in contrast google xe pixel also has single lens and with the help of machine learning did fantastic job in my tests producing portrait mode photos featuring dogs food and people
apple said that for the xr xe portrait mode the company wanted to focus on getting photos of people to look just right
that said people who are less dog crazy and more interested in shooting photos of well people probably won xe mind this limitation on the xr in my tests the xr was excellent at taking portrait photos of my partner properly sharpening details of her head including her hair strands while blurring the background
let xe speed through what else you need to know about the xr
apple said the xr had the longest battery life among the new iphones it gets hours of video playback compared with hours on the xs max in my tests didn xe notice meaningful difference both iphones had long enough battery life to get me through the day
in speed tests measuring single computing core with benchmarking app the xr was just as fast as the xs percent faster than google xe pixel and percent faster than samsung xe galaxy
the body of the xr is about half millimeter thicker than the xs partly because the cheaper phone had to make room for the backlighting used to illuminate its lcd screen in addition the xr xe inch screen is bit bigger than the xs with inch screen as result it felt bulkier in the pocket than the xs of course the xs max with inch screen felt the bulkiest
the xr lacks touch the iphone feature that lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen instead placing your finger over button like the camera shortcut on the lock screen and holding it down results in haptic feedback this is negligible omission forgot that touch even existed because rarely use it
the xr comes in six colors white black blue yellow coral and red the xs phones come in three gold white and black
as is often the case for new gadgets good things come to those who wait if you resisted splurging on the xs to wait for the xr you will be rewarded with great phone xe and some extra cash lying around

each week kevin roose technology columnist at the new york times discusses developments in the tech industry offering analysis and maybe joke or two this week farhad manjoo also technology columnist makes return to the roundup as well want this newsletter in your inbox sign up here
farhad hello kevin xe ve been off for three months to write book what xe miss
kevin tons let xe see there was the rollout the continued facebook privacy freakout and the civil war at google over using to target drone strikes
oh and speaking of this is little awkward but xe xa our bosses spent the past three months training neural network to replace you as the author of this newsletter deepfarhad isn xe quite ready yet but our engineers are confident that it will attain farhad level insights fairly soon
but while you xe re still here in human form let xe talk about the year xe biggest overarching tech narrative the xe ctechlash xe against companies like facebook and google over issues like privacy data protection and antitrust concerns as someone who has been mercifully spared from every twist and turn of the techlash does it feel like lot has changed since you left
farhad you know what xe weird though there was lot of drama when was gone xe tech on capitol hill xe xe struck by how little has changed really
when left facebook was under the gun amazon was getting hit by president trump and apple and google were trying to stand clear of the fallout three months later facebook is still under the gun the president still regards amazon as pariah and apple and google still would very much like to be excluded from these narratives
xe not saying was expecting wholesale structural change among entrenched businesses over the course of season but still for all the fireworks in washington there xe been little movement on regulation or legislation to curb some of the excesses in tech don xe see much of an advance toward stricter antitrust scrutiny of the large tech firms and their most recent earnings reports show they xe re all going gangbusters americans may harbor growing worries about the power of tech companies but not enough to make us quit them
which isn xe to say the techlash isn xe real just that change will come slowly we xe re all living in world where most communication and commerce is ruled by handful of nearly unregulated oligopolies that sort of thing doesn xe change quickly guess
kevin yeah it xe definitely been slow roll and all of the scrutiny seems to be affecting companies xe public images more than their business models was curious so looked at the movement in the stock prices of facebook google alphabet amazon and twitter since you left on march facebook is up percent alphabet is up percent and amazon is up percent twitter is up whopping percent editor xe note maybe because farhad tweeted less
techlash indeed
farhad let xe turn to this week on monday morning went to wwdc apple xe annual developer conference which usually brings slew of previews of the stuff apple is working on this year xe keynote was muted affair there were no announcements about apple xe hardware xe though this is usually show about software apple often uses it to preview some new devices too xe and even the changes to apple xe apps and operating systems weren xe that flashy
this was on purpose for good reason every few years apple takes break from releasing bunch of new features and instead focuses on fixing up what xe under the hood of its software this year it is promising substantial speed improvements in its next version of ios it xe also outlining plan to let developers port their ios apps to the mac which could either be awesome or totally useless xe we xe ll see
and then there was the bit about how we xe re all staring at our phones too much the tech industry has been consumed recently by new worries over xe ctech addiction xe and both facebook and google recently announced plans to tackle digital xe cwell being xe now apple xe jumping in too in the next version of ios your phone will give you detailed stats about how often you use your phone and what you do on it and it will even let you block yourself and your children from using certain apps
the features looked great to me can xe wait to use them but do wonder how effective they will be as wrote this week apple xe stop using your phone announcements were awkwardly surrounded by announcements like its new augmented reality system that will only make your phone more irresistible xe not sure we can resist
kevin me either the irresistibility of smartphones is the reason that despite being eligible for an upgrade for years have stuck with my horrible iphone which has cracked screen and hilariously short battery life the awfulness of my phone is the only thing that prevents me from staring at it
xe also curious about whether apple will continue to escalate its feud with facebook was stunned that during the demos at apple xe developer conference they showed new privacy feature in safari that blocked ad trackers from facebook com it xe subtle passive aggressive tweak but by silicon valley standards it seemed like huge insult
it seems slightly opportunistic to kick social network while it xe down but apple xe aggressive criticism also highlights the real and growing philosophical differences between the two companies facebook is an advertising supported communications conglomerate aimed at the masses and dead set on remaining free so that all seven billion humans on earth can eventually be connected and monetized through its platform apple is predominantly high end hardware business that caters to an increasingly privacy conscious consumer base and thinks that security will be differentiating factor when people choose which smartphones tablets and laptops to buy
maybe it was inevitable that these two giants would clash but to tech writer who lives for drama it xe still interesting to watch
farhad did any other tech news catch your eye this week suspect you xe ve got lot to say about microsoft xe acquisition of github right
kevin do as journalist use github xe xa checks browser history xe xa never but loved paul ford xe essay in businessweek about what it represents within the world of software engineering he writes that xe cgithub made the social dynamics of software development easier to manage and track xe and that for microsoft the github acquisition could be turning point in its historically fraught relationship with open source developers it xe also sign that microsoft xe the boring drama free tech giant that often seems to be forgotten about these days xe is still very much in the game
farhad oh it is in fact speaking of stock prices while was gone microsoft xe market value beat that of alphabet google xe parent company microsoft is now the third most valuable company in america behind apple and amazon who xe have guessed
anyway that xe all for now here xe hoping that deepfarhad is ready for next week xe newsletter

each week kevin roose technology columnist at the new york times discusses developments in the tech industry offering analysis and maybe joke or two want this newsletter in your inbox sign up here
hello again xe back from week spent mostly offline and am excited to get back to the internet where xe sure things have been totally normal and borin xe checks earpiece xe hang on xe being told that elon musk is dating the canadian musician grimes after they connected on twitter over joke about an obscure artificial superintelligence thought experiment
whew was worried we xe slipped into normalcy onward
the biggest nonromantic tech news of this week came from new tool introduced at google xe annual developer conference the program known as duplex is an automated voice assistant capable of making hair appointments booking restaurant reservations and conducting other tasks over the phone it even inserts lifelike pauses and filler words like xe cum xe and xe chmm xe for extra realism at no point in the demo were the receptionists on the other end of the calls informed that they were talking to computer rather than another human
the onstage demo of duplex drew lots of oohs and aahs admittedly it was an incredible piece of technological theater xe reminiscent of the xe cone more thing xe twists of golden age apple events and it xe important to keep in mind that duplex is just an experiment and it may never be released publicly in its current form
but the demo xe which amounted to series of extremely high tech crank calls xe raised lot of hackles
zeynep tufekci professor and writer called duplex xe chorrifying xe and said that google xe willingness to use to fool humans xe and to brag about its ability to do so on stage at public event xe showed that xe csilicon valley is ethically lost rudderless and has not learned thing xe
matt haughey the creator of the internet forum metafilter tweeted xe chow google did that duplex voice demo without anyone flagging it internally is beyond me xe the company he added xe cneeds of gut checks xe
in statement google representative said xe cwhat we showed at was an early technology demo and we look forward to incorporating feedback as we develop this into product xe
even some experts were taken aback by the duplex demo which showed off kind of technology that scammers could one day use to make mass robocalls conduct social engineering hacks and impersonate people on the phone google has said that the technology won xe be used for telemarketing the company says it will be used to call businesses using publicly available numbers to gather information like store xe hours but it doesn xe take much imagination to see how this kind of technology could be used for all kinds of questionable or dangerous tasks and there xe an obvious ethical question of whether robot caller should be required to identify itself as nonhuman
erik brynjolfsson professor at who has written extensively about artificial intelligence told the the washington post that while google xe duplex demo was technologically xe camazing xe it still raised ethical questions
xe ci don xe think the main goal of should be to mimic humans xe he said
defenders of google xe duplex experiment have pointed out that an automated phone call service could be helpful for people with disabilities or for freeing people from annoying customer service slogs xe co google cancel my cable subscription xe but google is now in precarious position it wants to keep pushing its development forward but it needs to do so in ways that won xe scare people at time when distrust of the tech industry is growing by the day
bloomberg reports that the backlash to duplex caught google by surprise that to me is the most disturbing piece of this week xe news xe that people inside the company thought that demo of advanced fooling an unwitting human receptionist would be greeted with universal praise
keep thinking of twitter thread posted last november by kumail nanjiani one of the stars of hbo xe xe csilicon valley xe he noted that while doing research for the show the show xe crew members often visited the offices of tech companies and were struck by how little thought engineers gave to the ethical implications of their products
xe coften we xe ll see tech that is scary xe mr nanjiani wrote xe cand we xe ll bring up our concerns to them we are realizing that zero consideration seems to be given to the ethical implications of tech they don xe even have pat rehearsed answer they are shocked at being asked which means nobody is asking those questions xe
maybe google should have invited few more actors to their prelaunch product meetings
some other tech stories found interesting this week
xe xa my colleague sheera frenkel has story about all the mountains of facebook data scraped by academic researchers much of which is still trading hands in the open and potentially being misused cambridge analytica is increasingly looking like the tip of the iceberg
xe xa speaking of facebook my colleague cade metz reports that the social network is opening up new labs in seattle and pittsburgh mostly by raiding nearby research universities for talent professor at the university of washington sums up the problem nicely xe cif we lose all our faculty it will be hard to keep preparing the next generation of researchers xe
xe xa at the atlantic robin sloan writes about fortnite the video game that is taking the nation by storm and that am still very bad at
xe xa my colleague michael corkery has good story about how walmart is trying to keep up with amazon by spraying money all over the commerce sector
xe xa finally found this story about spotify xe decision to remove songs by kelly from playlists because of accusations of sexual abuse against him fascinating it xe proof that internet services can xe be neutral in and that complaints about xe cde platforming xe and censorship are only going to grow louder as more large tech platforms exercise their powers

in backyard in erie pa an unusual cardinal has appeared displaying both male and female traits scientists say it may be so called gynandromorph
by karen weintraub
bird hopping outside the window lately is the strangest that shirley and jeffrey caldwell have ever seen
its left side is the taupe shade of female cardinals its right the signature scarlet of males
researchers believe that the cardinal frequenting the caldwells xe bird feeder in erie pa is rare bilateral gynandromorph half male and half female not much is known about the unusual phenomenon but this sexual split has been reported among birds reptiles butterflies and crustaceans
no one can be sure the bird is gynandromorph without analyzing its genes with blood test or necroscopy but the split in plumage down the middle is characteristic of the rare event according to daniel hooper an evolutionary biologist at the cornell university lab of ornithology
he said that gynandromorphs could theoretically be created through the fusion of two developing embryos that were separately fertilized
it xe also possible that female produces an egg that contains both copies of her sex chromosomes and and is then fertilized by two sperm each with chromosome while human sex chromosomes are labeled xx for females and xy for males female birds are zw and males are zz scientists aren xe precisely sure how such an egg yields chick with both zw and zz cells
the split runs down the middle of the bird simply because vertebrates develop in bilaterally symmetrical way although one side would largely be zw and the other zz previous research suggests there is some mixing of cells in the bird xe body
but in essence each side of the bird would be largely the brother or sister of the other genes other than those that confer gender also are affected
sex determination in mammals is controlled by gene on the chromosome that stimulates the development of testes the hormones of which regulate development of the rest of the organism that xe why gynandromorphism is so rarely seen in mammals dr hooper said
he doesn xe see any reason that cardinals would be more likely to be of mixed sex than other creatures but their color contrast by gender makes them particularly noticeable
female cardinals are taupe colored and quieter than their brightly hued mates in addition to their red color male cardinals sing more often and with more complicated tunes both to declare their territory and to attract females
in brian peer professor of biology at western illinois university in macomb ill began studying cardinal with similar split down the middle over the next two years he made more than visits to the backyard of retired high school biology teacher whose bird feeder had attracted right half female left half male bird xe the opposite of the caldwells xe cardinal
like the science times page on facebook sign up for the science times newsletter
an expert in the behavior of cowbirds dr peer was hoping to see whether the cardinal would behave more like female or male unfortunately he never saw the bird with others though he disagreed with the notion that the cardinal was lonely xe many cardinals never successfully mate in the wild he said
dr peer watched the bird over two winters but it eventually was pushed out of the teacher xe yard by male cardinal that aggressively defended its territory the gynandromorph wasn xe seen again
gynandromorphs are believed to be infertile although the cardinal in the caldwells xe yard appears to have paired off with male bird dr hooper said it xe too soon to know whether that male is the mixed bird xe father or mate and whether it will stick around for mating season
while birds have pair of ovaries the only functional one is on the left side xe which in this cardinal is female so it is theoretically possible that it could lay eggs dr hooper said he would expect any offspring to be genetically conventional because its egg cells would have only one sex chromosome
dr hooper said he would love to be able to study the bird in depth to learn more about its genetics and also to understand how its brain functions in gynandromorphs half of the brain too is female and half male
male songbirds have many more neural connections in their brains to allow them to sing complex tunes and he wonders how half and half brain would affect this cardinal xe ability to learn evaluate and produce song as well as its desire to do so
xe ci would imagine xe he said in an email xe cthere simply just isn xe complete neural network for producing song or the right hormonal cocktail in the brain circulating to motivate the bird to sing one even if it could xe
butterflies can also be gynandromorphs said josh jahner postdoctoral researcher at the university of nevada reno either half and half or by even more varied proportions
in his research dr jahner found that the wings of gynandromorphic butterflies are similar to the wings of typical butterflies xe though male and female colorations appear on the same insect but each gynandromorph xe genitalia is different from every other xe dr jahner said figuring out why may help scientists understand the rules of development
for her part shirley caldwell is enjoying both the attention and the opportunity to watch the unusual cardinal and to look for patterns in its daily activities xe cit xe been very rewarding as far as learning about the bird xe she said xe cit xe once in lifetime thing and it xe fun xe

mountain view calif xe few years ago google created new kind of computer chip to help power its giant artificial intelligence systems these chips were designed to handle the complex processes that some believe will be key to the future of the computer industry
on monday the internet giant said it would allow other companies to buy access to those chips through its cloud computing service google hopes to build new business around the chips called tensor processing units or
xe cwe are trying to reach as many people as we can as quickly as we can xe said zak stone who works alongside the small team of google engineers that designs these chips
google xe move highlights several sweeping changes in the way modern technology is built and operated google is in the vanguard of movement to design chips specifically for artificial intelligence worldwide push that includes dozens of start ups as well as familiar names like intel qualcomm and nvidia
and these days companies like google amazon and microsoft are not just big internet companies they are big hardware makers
as way of cutting costs and improving the efficiency of the multibillion dollar data centers that underpin its online empire google designs much of the hardware inside these massive facilities from the computer servers to the networking gear that ties these machines together other internet giants do much the same
in addition to its chips which sit inside its data centers the company has designed an chip for its smartphones
right now google xe new service is focused on way to teach computers to recognize objects called computer vision technology but as time goes on the new chips will also help businesses build wider range of services mr stone said
at the end of last year hoping to accelerate its work on driverless cars lyft began testing google xe new chips
using the chips lyft wanted to accelerate the development of systems that allow driverless cars to say identify street signs or pedestrians xe ctraining xe these systems can take days but with the new chips the hope is that this will be reduced to hours
xe cthere is huge potential here xe said anantha kancherla who oversees software for the lyft driverless car project
chips have helped accelerate the development of everything from the google assistant the service that recognizes voice commands on android phones to google translate the internet app that translates one language into another
they are also reducing google xe dependence on chip makers like nvidia and intel in similar move it designed its own servers and networking hardware reducing its dependence on hardware makers like dell hp and cisco
this keeps costs down which is essential when running large online operation said casey bisson who helps oversee cloud computing service called joyent which is owned by samsung at times the only way to build an efficient service is to build your own hardware
xe cthis is about packing as much computing power as possible within small area within heat budget within power budget xe mr bisson said
new wave of artificial intelligence including services like google assistant are driven by xe neural networks xe which are complex algorithms that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data by analyzing database of old customer support phone calls for example neural network can learn to recognize commands spoken into smartphone but this requires serious computing power
typically engineers train these algorithms using graphics processing units or which are chips that were originally designed for rendering images for games and other graphics heavy software most of these chips are supplied by nvidia
in designing its own chips google was looking to exceed what was possible with these graphics oriented chips speed up its own work and lure more businesses onto its cloud services
at the same time google has gained some independence from nvidia and an ability to negotiate lower prices with its chip suppliers
xe cgoogle has become so big it makes sense to invest in chips xe said fred weber who spent decade as the chief technology officer at the chip maker amd xe cthat gives them leverage they can cut out the middleman xe
this does not mean that google will stop buying chips from nvidia and other chip makers but it is altering the market xe cwho xe buying and who xe selling has changed xe mr weber said
over the years google has even flirted with the possibility of designing its own version of the chips it buys from intel
mr weber and other insiders question whether google would ever do this just because is so complex and it would be so much more difficult to design and maintain one of these chips but at private event in san francisco last fall david patterson computer science professor at the university of california berkeley who now works on chip technologies at google was asked if the company would go that far
xe cthat xe not rocket science xe he said

amazon the world xe largest online retailer and largest cloud computing company is pushing into new line of work computer chips
late last month the company based in seattle revealed that it had spent the last few years building new chip for use inside the millions of servers in its data centers around the world
amazon does not plan to sell this chip directly to customers but the decision by one of the world xe biggest buyers of computer processors to go the do it yourself route is likely to have major impact on intel the iconic silicon valley chip maker
intel has struggled to keep up with recent technology trends from the increasing use of mobile devices to artificial intelligence as influence over chip designs has been shifting to amazon apple and google which already dominate much of the rest of the tech industry
amazon xe new chip arrives as market forces are rapidly undercutting chip makers and their billion in yearly sales online operations like amazon and google have grown so large they can save significant money by making chips tailored to their needs rather than buying them from longtime suppliers
the homegrown chip also gives amazon bargaining power with intel which hasn xe had much competition in the server market in recent years the internet company will still buy from intel because it would be difficult to build all the chips it needed on its own but now it will have options
intel acknowledges that companies like amazon want to reduce their dependency on one big chip supplier xe ci am not unaware of the dynamic xe lisa spelman an intel vice president said xe cour goal is to understand and respectfully acknowledge that desire xe
about percent of the server chips sold around the world go to about companies including large internet companies like amazon and handful of telecommunication firms said shane rau chip analyst with the research firm idc that just one of them is shifting its business is terrible news for intel
xe ceach one of these companies is so large they represent market unto themselves xe mr rau said
in recent years google has designed specialized chips for artificial intelligence technology facebook and microsoft which like most internet companies are major buyers of chips from intel have indicated that they are working on similar chips
apple beat the other tech giants to this cost saving trend four years ago when it unveiled its first custom built chip for the iphone google and microsoft are also building the chips that go into devices like smartphones and virtual reality headsets
amazon has upped the ante in it spent reported million to acquire chip maker annapurna labs which helped build the new central processing unit or
xe the centerpiece of computer xe operations xe is the sort of chip that intel has made for decades to run personal computers and servers building these chips requires rare expertise and hundreds of millions of dollars in capital it is big step up in complexity from building chips tailored to certain tasks
xe cthe belief was that you needed some magic to build processor particularly server processor xe said andrew feldman the chief executive of the chip start up cerebras and former executive at the chip maker amd xe cyou had to be intel or amd xe and that was about it xe
amazon executives believe the chip which was designed to be more energy efficient will help reduce the cost of electrical power in its data centers it said it was offering cloud computing service that would allow business customers to use its new chip the cost of the service could be percent lower than other options
and when amazon buys chips from other companies homegrown option gives it even more sway over prices xe cthey can now say to intel xe we will just move the workloads to other chips xe xe mr feldman said
amazon has also designed chip for artificial intelligence called the inferentia in recent blog post james hamilton vice president and distinguished engineer inside amazon xe cloud computing arm said the company would continue building new chips for artificial intelligence and other specialized tasks
google has designed three generations of chips and it has long hinted that it will eventually build xe cthat xe not rocket science xe google chip specialist dave patterson said late last year
though it is still enormously difficult building chip is easier than it used to be amazon licensed much of the technology from arm the company that provides the basic technology for most smartphone chips it made the chip through tsmc taiwanese company
for intel amazon xe move into is strike at longtime strength intel was beaten to the smartphone and tablet market decade ago significant missed opportunity the tech industry shifted and intel didn xe shift with it
but intel has percent share of server chip sales according to idc it was percent until its longtime competitor amd which had stayed on the sidelines of the server business for about decade recently re entered the market
intel xe profits continue to rise with the rapid expansion of the tech industry but the financial results of its most recent quarter highlight the chip maker xe dependence on servers intel xe data center group which sells both server and chips pulled in billion percent increase over the previous year the group now accounts for more than percent of intel xe revenue
as the chip market has changed intel has tried to diversify in recent years it bought three companies that design chips for artificial intelligence and other types of hardware that are becoming increasingly important inside smartphones cars and data centers
the competition outside of traditional server chips is extensive in addition to amazon google and nvidia xe the dominant maker of specialty chips for tasks like xe dozens of smaller companies are building chips
through their fast growing cloud computing services amazon microsoft alibaba and google are reinventing how companies set up their computer networks going to cloud service allows companies to wash their hands of acquiring and maintaining back room computer systems xe the tech experts do it for them
it is lucrative business amazon web services brings in nearly billion year and it accounts for percent of amazon xe profits
inside these cloud operations the internet companies are also reinventing how computers are built they are designing much of their own hardware from the servers to the networking gear that connects servers facebook is doing similar work with the technology in its data centers
amazon xe new chip is running only small fraction of the software across the company xe online empire but that is expected to expand
xe cwe will look back at this as watershed moment xe said mr feldman the chief executive of cerebras

ford motor company said on wednesday that it would build its first autonomous vehicles at million production center in michigan as part of an earlier pledge to invest million in manufacturing operations in the state
production of the self driving vehicles is expected to start in with hybrid vehicles being shipped in to be fitted with driverless technology the carmaker said ford said the work would be done in the detroit area but did not specify where kelli felker spokeswoman for the company said the hybrids would not be an existing model
in addition to the autonomous vehicle production center ford said it planned to expand its production capacity at an existing plant in flat rock mich where it will continue to make its mustang car the company said it intended to invest more than million in the flat rock factory and start production on new electric vehicle models there by
the effort will create new jobs in the next few years the vast majority of them at the flat rock plant the company said
ford xe intentions for its detroit area factories have fluctuated in recent years in early the company said it was abandoning plans for billion plant in mexico and would instead invest million and add jobs at the flat rock plant for the production of electric and hybrid vehicles
later that year the company appeared to backtrack saying that it would take advantage of lower labor costs in mexico and make new battery powered sport utility vehicle in cuautitl xc xa in goal it reiterated on wednesday the mexican facility is ford xe first electric vehicle factory the flat rock location will be its second
last year electric and plug in hybrid vehicles were sold in the united states making up just percent of car purchases according to estimates by insideevs com tesla accounted for half of the tally
ford has said it plans to invest billion over all in electrification with battery electric vehicle models by and hybrid options by
earlier this year ford and volkswagen laid out an agreement under which they said they would cut costs by cooperating on the development of electric and autonomous cars
president trump spent several days on twitter this week admonishing ford xe rival general motors to reopen an idled car factory in lordstown ohio
ford said mr trump xe comments had not influenced the timing of its announcement
xe cwhat we do is result of our business xe ms felker said xe cthe reason we xe re doing it now is because we have to tell our suppliers xe

traditional automakers have faced increasing pressure in recent years from changed driving habits the swift development of technology and emerging rivals from silicon valley
so to avoid being left behind some are teaming up
volkswagen and ford two of the world xe biggest carmakers have announced that they are exploring strategic alliance possibly joining forces for an array of projects like the development of vans
xe cmarkets and customer demand are changing at an incredible speed xe thomas sedran volkswagen xe head of strategy said in statement released tuesday evening xe cto adapt to the challenging environment it is of utmost importance to gain flexibility through alliances xe
the deal does not involve any financial commitment from either company for now but it raises the specter of some form of tie up as the two companies face series of issues in march bmw and daimler two longtime rival german automakers said they would merge their car sharing businesses
traditional carmakers like ford volkswagen and others are increasingly making investments in new technologies like autonomous and electric cars as well as services like vehicle sharing but they risk being caught out as deep pocketed tech giants and upstart businesses join the fray google xe parent company alphabet has made major strides in driverless cars and has stock market value many times that of ford and volkswagen while tesla the electric carmaker has market capitalization greater than that of many old line behemoths
commercial vehicles xe category that includes minibuses and vans xe offer an opportunity ford noted in its most recent quarterly results that commercial vehicles as well as larger trucks and utility vehicles like pickup trucks were expected to make up almost percent of the company xe portfolio in north america by demand for new commercial vehicles is also growing in europe according to the european automobile manufacturers association
but automakers will have to balance growth in the market for vans against tightening emissions standards proposed targets from the european commission for example sharply reduce the average allowed level of carbon emissions for cars and trucks in the region
ford has already been trying out hybrid vans in london the vehicles can change settings based on their location switching to electric mode when in low emissions area they are being used by businesses as well as by the metropolitan police in may ford said that it would also run tests in valencia spain
xe cwe see evolving needs of customers globally and those needs are in the areas of connected services and powertrain choices xe said michael baumann spokesman for ford in europe referring to cars xe energy sources customers xe needs are xe cchanging dramatically xe he added
partnership could give both companies the chance to take advantage of expected growth in demand for electric delivery vans according to peter wells professor of business and sustainability at the center for automotive industry research at cardiff university in wales businesses like ikea and dhl are already shifting to electric delivery vehicles and others are expected to follow suit
xe cit xe massive market it xe growing quickly xe mr wells said xe cit xe been almost entirely diesel and many authorities are looking to exclude diesel xe
the partnership between ford and volkswagen is one of several undertaken by traditional carmakers in addition to the alliance between daimler and bmw which along with volkswagen xe audi unit dominate the global market for luxury vehicles fiat chrysler is working with google on self driving cars general motors has invested in lyft and volvo has made chassis for uber
volkswagen has been particularly active in aligning itself with other carmakers
it agreed in april to work with hino motors toyota xe truck brand to cooperate on self driving trucks volkswagen already owned stake in navistar in north america and has said it would consider takeover of the company it also holds stake in the chinese truck maker sinotruk and audi said on wednesday that it would work with hyundai to share technology and components for electric cars

president trump warned today that partial government shutdown xe cwill last for very long time xe seeking to blame democrats for potential funding lapse that he said last week he would proudly own
on thursday mr trump refused to sign stopgap measure to avert shutdown saying that any spending bill must include billion for wall on the southwestern border without deal partial shutdown would begin at midnight tonight
house republicans approved version of the bill on thursday night that included money for the wall but it xe almost certain to fail in the senate today
why it matters if funding expires nine government departments xe including homeland security and the justice and state departments xe would close and more than federal employees would have to work without pay here xe what else to expect
the daily on today xe episode our deputy washington editor explains the showdown
day after president trump said he would withdraw american troops from syria jim mattis retired four star marine general said he would leave the pentagon in february
in his resignation letter mr mattis condemned mr trump xe rejection of international alliances and emphasized the importance of challenging russia and china which he wrote wanted xe ca world consistent with their authoritarian model xe read his letter
international reaction america xe allies in europe and asia indicated today that mr mattis xe resignation and troop withdrawals would be watershed moments in washington xe relations with the world
news analysis the syria withdrawal is one of several announcements this week that demonstrate mr trump xe xe cunswerving conviction that his political survival depends on securing his conservative base xe one of our white house correspondents writes

matthew whitaker who was named acting attorney general last month has cleared himself to supervise the investigation by the special counsel robert mueller according to letter the justice department sent to senate leaders
ethics specialists at the department had recommended that mr whitaker recuse himself from the investigation into russian election interference as his predecessor jeff sessions had done
the news came soon after the disclosure that president trump xe nominee for attorney general william barr had written memo in june criticizing mr mueller for focusing on whether mr trump had committed obstruction of justice

alex bell hates it when the designated bike lane he is pedaling down is blocked so too do many cycling new yorkers but mr bell hates it so much that he has tried to do something about it three years ago he sued targeting the delivery company xe trucks for blocking his bike path case he lost that is in its second round of appeals
now mr bell is trying another tack xe the year old computer scientist who lives in harlem has created prototype of machine learning algorithm that studies footage from traffic camera and tracks precisely how often bike lanes are obstructed by delivery trucks parked cars and waiting cabs among other scofflaws it is piece of data that transportation advocates said is missing in the largely anecdotal discussion of how well the city xe bus and bike lanes do or do not work
at time of intense criticism of new york xe poorly performing public transportation mr bell has expanded his study to also look at the flow of bus lanes in city where the fleet operated by the metropolitan transportation authority inches along at an average speed of seven miles per hour making it the slowest major bus system in the country
the blocking of bus and bike lanes has become sore spot among transportation advocates who believe the city xe enforcement efforts are inadequate
mr bell xe project focused on one city block xe st nicholas avenue between th and th streets xe over the course of days his preliminary findings were stark using traffic camera footage trained on one bus stop and two bike lanes one for traveling north the other for heading south mr bell found that the bus stop was blocked percent of the time while the bike lanes were blocked percent of the time
xe ceveryone keeps talking about the bus lanes being blocked and buses being so slow could just say xe oh they are so blocked it xe so bad xe xe but that xe not very helpful xe mr bell said in an interview xe ci thought to myself xe how could you show to everyone that bus stops and bike lanes are routinely blocked xe xe
as the city has rolled out total of miles of specially designated bus lanes throughout the city keeping them clear has emerged as major challenge xe what good is bus only pathway if it is blocked by an idling car mail truck or even police officer the same goes for the miles of unprotected bike lanes that are painted green and lace new york xe streetscape
but no data exists that captures the scope of the problem in quantifiable way in its absence biking and transit advocates have taken matters into their own hands posting photos of offenders including government and police vehicles on social media as way of countering the problem through public shaming
the enforcement that does exist through the use of cameras is slim just of the city xe bus routes have cameras mounted on objects like streetlights that are similar to red light cameras any plan to add more such cameras must be approved by the state legislature
enforcement along bus lanes and bike paths is primarily the responsibility of the police department last year police officers issued over moving violations to vehicles traveling in bus lanes about parking tickets for blocking lanes and about parking tickets for impeding bike lanes data does not exist for moving violations in bike lanes which the police began tracking this year
while those numbers seem impressive advocates believe it barely touches the severity of the problem xe cbased on anyone xe observation bus lanes in new york are chronically blocked xe xe said paul steely white the executive director of transportation alternatives bicycling advocacy organization
andy byford the president of new york city transit has met with the police department to encourage the agency to increase its vigilance blocking the bus lane xe cis selfish and it xe unacceptable xe mr byford said in recent interview aboard bus that was forced to swerve in and out of designated bus lane to avoid parked vans and idling taxis
xe ci get that people have to deliver things but the bus lane should be for the buses period xe mr byford said adding that the transit agency is developing plan to improve bus service that may include adding front facing cameras mounted on buses measure that other cities have taken to strengthen enforcement of bus only lanes
increasing the number of bus and bike lanes but under enforcing the rules to keep them unimpeded xe cis one of these programs that ratchets up new yorker sincere cynicism about government doing the right thing xe mr white said
to gather actual data on how often blockages occur mr bell downloaded days of publicly available video from department of transportation camera mounted on traffic light at the corner of th street and st nicholas avenue then he fed over images of different types of vehicles like trucks buses and cars into his computer training it to identify what exactly was blocking the way in the case of bus stops for example mr bell adjusted the computer program so that it was able to differentiate between buses that are supposed to be there from vehicles that were sitting there illegally
his work took about three weeks after the programming was complete it took the computer about day to crunch though the days of footage mr bell xe program only measured the percentage of time the lanes on his test block were obstructed but from that he said he was able to extrapolate actual numbers and calculated about vehicles blocking the bike lane and over in the bus lane he has made the source code he developed to monitor the lanes free and publicly available online in the hope that it will be picked up and used to amplify the extent of the issue
xe ci want to raise up new york city xe said mr bell who grew up on the upper west side and attended horace mann school and columbia university xe ci never want to live anywhere else but we have big problems we have big problems especially when it comes to transportation am hoping that just seeing the data will help it be less ignorable xe

san francisco xe it is not often that sports metaphor becomes the news of the day in legal fight over intellectual property theft accusations between two tech industry titans
in federal court on monday lawyers for waymo the self driving car unit of google xe parent company alphabet compared uber to rosie ruiz the runner who was accused of cutting onto the course near the end of the boston marathon to finish first among women in the race she was eventually stripped of the title
in the long awaited opening statements of jury trial expected to last three to four weeks waymo claimed that uber knowing that it was trailing in the race to develop self driving cars took shortcut by stealing technology from waymo which was spun out of google in late
waymo contended that uber had done so by colluding with anthony levandowski former google engineer to take his former employer xe intellectual property and bring it to the ride hailing service
in boston sports vernacular that sort of cheating is called xe cpulling rosie ruiz xe it is not compliment
the legal drama has gripped silicon valley since waymo filed its lawsuit nearly year ago waymo is considered leader in autonomous vehicles and was pouring resources into research and development long before other companies
but in the last few years competitors have been hiring former google engineers for their own self driving car projects among them uber is considered formidable because it has billions to spend and can test the technology using its vast ride sharing network
in an indication of how closely this case is being followed line to get into the courtroom at the federal courthouse in san francisco started forming an hour before the trial was scheduled to begin at
the witness list includes technology billionaires like travis kalanick uber xe former chief executive and larry page chief executive of alphabet the judge william alsup even said he had been informed that someone was impersonating him on twitter
waymo argues that uber has misappropriated eight trade secrets pertaining mainly to lidar xe an abbreviation for xe clight detecting and ranging xe xe sensors that help the cars navigate on their own the company is asking for an injunction preventing uber from developing an autonomous vehicle using its lidar technology in addition it wants financial compensation for uber xe use of the technology
waymo xe lawyers repeatedly drew comparison to ms ruiz one of the most brazen cheaters in sports history charles verhoeven waymo xe lawyer said uber like the disgraced marathoner wanted to win no matter what and realized that it couldn xe win playing by the rules
xe cwe xe re bringing this case because uber is cheating xe said mr verhoeven who is partner at the law firm quinn emanuel urquhart amp sullivan xe cthey took our technology to win at all costs xe
he highlighted internal communications from uber executives talking about how winning was an imperative and saying that the company needed to find xe ccheat codes xe the internal messages also noted that the lidar technology being developed by mr levandowski was essential for uber xe success in self driving cars and that there was no substitute
in their opening statements uber xe lawyers countered that the company had developed its technology on its own and that any similarities were due to the information xe being generally known or easy to figure out for uber xe engineers and there is no evidence that any of google xe technology made its way to uber they said
so why then has waymo dragged uber into court to kill competitive threat said bill carmody uber xe lawyer
xe cthat was quite story but xe going to tell you right upfront it didn xe happen period end of story xe said mr carmody who is partner at the law firm susman godfrey xe clike most conspiracy theories it doesn xe make sense when you hear the whole story xe
in mr carmody xe version of events when uber hired team of self driving engineers in from carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh google xe management became concerned that it would become footnote in the history of self driving cars
to emphasize that the files downloaded by mr levandowski before leaving google were never found at uber mr carmody reverted to the ms ruiz comparison waymo was actually race official who looked for evidence of cheating but couldn xe find any
in day of sports metaphors uber countered with bay area favorite mr carmody said the hiring of mr levandowski pioneer in the field of self driving vehicles wasn xe an act of desperation instead it was the act of strong team trying to land the best available talent xe the way the golden state warriors signed the basketball star kevin durant in to an already championship caliber lineup
at the same time uber also distanced itself from mr levandowski who is expected to exercise his fifth amendment right to avoid self incrimination when he is called to testify mr carmody said uber regretted hiring him and noted that it had fired him in may xe almost two months after mr levandowski had refused to cooperate with uber xe case
john krafcik waymo xe chief executive and the first witness called by the company said he and mr levandowski had had disagreements about the direction of google xe self driving car project he said mr levandowski had wanted faster progress even if it came at the expense of safety features
before his departure from google mr levandowski sent an email in january to mr page alphabet xe chief executive saying the self driving car project was xe cbroken xe he argued for permission to create rogue team to compete against their co workers because the company was moving too slowly
xe che went from someone called friend to someone considered an enemy xe mr krafcik said

mountain view calif xe peter calthorpe thinks silicon valley has it all wrong he rejects the ideas of tech industry visionaries who say personal autonomous vehicles will soon be the solution to urban problems like traffic congestion
mr calthorpe is berkeley based urban planner who is one of the creators of new urbanism which promotes mixed use walkable neighborhoods his designs emphasize the proximity of housing shopping and public space
he is not opposed to autonomous vehicles mr calthorpe xe quarrel is with the idea that the widespread adoption of personally owned self driving cars will solve transportation problems in fact he worries it will lead to more urban congestion and suburban sprawl
xe cone thing is certain zero or single occupant vehicles xe even ones that can drive themselves xe care bad thing xe he and the transportation planner jerry walters wrote in an article last year in urban land an urban planning journal xe cthey cause congestion eat up energy exacerbate sprawl and emit more carbon per passenger mile xe
mr calthorpe believes that in trying to solve very hard technical problem silicon valley is ignoring an easier application for autonomous technology that has the potential to quickly change mass transit and help solve the valley xe housing crisis it starts with backing away from solo car trips
popular claim by the advocates of self driving cars is that not only will they be safer than human driven cars but they will lead to fewer cars faster commutes and radical rethinking of cities where finding place to park is no longer priority
but mr calthorpe citing range of transportation studies has simulated through computer models the impact of self driving vehicles in urban settings he argues that if they are used the way today xe vehicles are xe carrying single individual in most cases xe they will lead to more congestion
xe cthe key distinction is the number of people per vehicle xe said mr walters principal at fehr amp peers transportation consultancy in walnut creek xe cwithout pretty radically increasing the number of people per vehicle autonomous systems will increase total miles traveled xe
when it is easier to travel in city in self driving cars mr calthorpe said everyone will want to do so and when self driving vehicles are more affordable xe which could take years to happen xe people who currently rely on public transit while running their errands will instead send their cars to pick up the groceries and the dry cleaning adding significantly to what mr walters and other urban planners call xe ctotal vehicle miles xe
this year mr calthorpe challenged silicon valley to take another look at its housing and transportation problem in proposal in which he asked xe ccan one street solve the san francisco bay area housing crisis xe
in addition to his planning consultancy mr calthorpe has created urban footprint company that offers software design tool for planners architects and environmental analysts who want to model different kinds of development in urban and regional settings
he used his software to show that by changing just commercial zoning to permit higher density along el camino real xe the mile boulevard that stretches through the heart of silicon valley from san francisco to san jose xe it would be possible add more than quarter million housing units
the valley xe housing crisis can be explained in data that shows that since the region has added jobs for every new home built the median home price has reached and rents have gone up percent since one of the consequences of the growing imbalance between housing and jobs is the increasing traffic and congestion according to an urban footprint report
to avoid congestion the plan requires efficient mass transit mr calthorpe has proposed an alternative xe autonomous rapid transit or art xe using fleets of self driving vans in reserved lanes on main arteries like el camino real those lanes would allow the vehicles to travel faster and require lower level of autonomous technology and the vans could travel separately or be connected together
recent study that urban footprint did in collaboration with fehr amp peers determined that an autonomous rapid transit system which could be built today would be twice as fast as conventional bus and cost little more than half as much to operate
mr calthorpe xe plan is an evolution of the concept of xe ctransit oriented development xe he pioneered while teaching at the university of california berkeley in the late it focuses on designing urban communities that encourage people to live near transit services and decrease their dependence on driving
the idea has attracted the attention of public transit activists in southern california
xe cautonomous rapid transit xe greater capacity combined with lower cost could really be the stimulus for the housing development xe said denny zane executive director of move la group that has built broad community support for funding improvements in transportation xe cwe need to integrate autonomous technologies in setting that will enhance transit use xe
mr zane said the art technology would dovetail nicely with planning idea called grand boulevards which has been funded by two ballot propositions in the los angeles region and has until now been focused on human driven system known as bus rapid transit
most recent silicon valley start ups have focused on personal vehicles rather than mass transit but in july waymo the self driving car unit of google xe parent company alphabet announced partnership with valley metro in the phoenix region to develop transportation system that would look very much like mr calthorpe xe art concept
to gain broad acceptance for his idea however mr calthorpe needs to convince city officials like lenny siegel the mayor of mountain view where google is based
mr siegel is veteran community activist whose focus is on the imbalance between jobs and housing and the impact of the long commutes made by people who work in the city he also has expressed concerns about anything that will affect the flow of conventional automobile traffic
mountain view is trying to plan for future that will require moving as many as people back and forth each day from the caltrain railroad corridor that runs between san francisco and san jose to workplaces like google currently city planners envision an autonomous system like the one that mr calthorpe envisions but on an elevated track
mr calthorpe insists that planners need to take bold steps and argues that rethinking major boulevards like el camino by filling in with denser housing and adding more efficient autonomous transit system is the best place to start
xe cyou have to redesign the street itself xe he said xe cyou need to add autonomous transit and you need to get rid of parallel parking and put in bikeways and better sidewalks xe

san francisco xe there is little doubt that the defense department needs help from silicon valley xe biggest companies as it pursues work on artificial intelligence the question is whether the people who work at those companies are willing to cooperate
on thursday robert work former deputy secretary of defense announced that he is teaming up with the center for new american security an influential washington think tank that specializes in national security to create task force of former government officials academics and representatives from private industry their goal is to explore how the federal government should embrace technology and work better with big tech companies and other organizations
there is growing sense of urgency to the question of what the united states is doing in artificial intelligence china has vowed to become the world xe leader in by committing billions of dollars to the effort like many other officials from government and industry mr work believes the united states risks falling behind
xe cthe question is how should the united states respond to this challenge xe he said xe cthis is sputnik moment xe
the military and intelligence communities have long played big role in the technology industry and had close ties with many of silicon valley xe early tech giants david packard hewlett packard xe co founder even served as the deputy secretary of defense under president richard nixon
but those relations have soured in recent years xe at least with the rank and file of some better known companies in documents leaked by the former defense contractor edward snowden revealed the breadth of spying on americans by intelligence services including monitoring the users of several large internet companies
two years ago that antagonism grew worse after the demanded that apple create special software to help it gain access to locked iphone that had belonged to gunman involved in mass shooting in san bernardino calif
xe cin the wake of edward snowden there has been lot of concern over what it would mean for silicon valley companies to work with the national security community xe said gregory allen an adjunct fellow with the center for new american security xe cthese companies are xe understandably xe very cautious about these relationships xe
the pentagon needs help on from silicon valley because that xe where the talent is the tech industry xe biggest companies have been hoarding expertise sometimes offering multimillion dollar pay packages that the government could never hope to match
mr work was the driving force behind the creation of project maven the defense department xe sweeping effort to embrace artificial intelligence his new task force will include terah lyons the executive director of the partnership on ai an industry group that includes many of silicon valley xe biggest companies
mr work will lead the member task force with andrew moore the dean of computer science at carnegie mellon university mr moore has warned that too much of the country xe computer science talent is going to work at america xe largest internet companies
with tech companies gobbling up all that talent who will train the next generation of experts who will lead government efforts
xe ceven if the does have the best companies it is not clear they are going to be involved in national security in substantive way xe mr allen said
google illustrates the challenges that big internet companies face in working more closely with the pentagon google xe former executive chairman eric schmidt who is still member of the board of directors of its parent company alphabet also leads the defense innovation board federal advisory committee that recommends closer collaboration with industry on technologies
last week two news outlets revealed that the defense department had been working with google in developing technology that can analyze aerial footage captured by flying drones the effort was part of project maven led by mr work some employees were angered that the company was contributing to military work
google runs two of the best research labs in the world xe google brain in california and deepmind in london
top researchers inside both google labs have expressed concern over the use of by the military when google acquired deepmind the company agreed to set up an internal board that would help ensure that the lab xe technology was used in an ethical way and one of the lab xe founders demis hassabis has explicitly said its would not be used for military purposes
google acknowledged in statement that the military use of xe craises valid concerns xe and said it was working on policies around the use of its so called machine learning technologies
among researchers and other technologists there is widespread fear that today xe machine learning techniques could put too much power in dangerous hands recent report from prominent labs and think tanks in both the united states and britain detailed the risks including problems with weapons and surveillance equipment
google said it was working with the defense department to build technology for xe cnon offensive uses only xe and mr work said the government explored many technologies that did not involve xe clethal force xe but it is unclear where google and other top internet companies will draw the line
xe cthis is conversation we have to have xe mr work said

the platform the volunteers log into is honed with machine learning algorithm which has analyzed past chats for actionable information for example the system automatically moves distressed people who write words like xe cgun xe xe cmilitary xe xe cfentanyl xe or crying emoji to the front of the line colored orange data shows those are the most likely indicators that the person will need an active rescue from and counselors start chats with them first responding within an average of seconds
the chats are also creating trove of information on distress nationwide the highest per capita texts come from montana midwesterners report the most bullying the coasts are the most stressed and people in the south most often mention issues you can track the state level data in real time at crisistrends org the organization xe tech team is currently working on software to make the counselors even faster for example suggesting they answer with xe cyou xe re strong xe to people who say they are overwhelmed
the data also helps people on the ground who are fighting crises in ohio started state specific keyword with the crisis text line xe hope xe and advertised it in schools the nonprofit xe data crunchers noticed that use of the keyword fell in the summer their ohio partners were alerted and placed advertising in movie theaters the texts surged once more

five years ago prukalpa sankar was studying business at university in singapore and interning at goldman sachs the beginning of what she thought would be decade of studying and working abroad before moving back to her native india that all changed in late night dorm brainstorm when she and another indian classmate varun banka who was interning at barclays wondered why the same amount of big data they saw informing financial decisions were not being applied to the gnarlier problems in their home country xe cwe thought wouldn xe it be so cool to use data to allocate where money gets spent in indian cities xe ms sankar said
they raised some seed capital through business plan competitions enough to get started and moved to new delhi after graduation in to test few pilots with data science start up they named socialcops
they discovered that much of the data in the world xe second most populous country was still gathered by pencil and paper in local languages and never converted digitally xe making any sort of big picture analysis impossible xe cit xe so difficult to reach data you can use people often give up in the process xe said ms sankar xe cyet when you can give people insights off the data they will make decisions off of it xe
in india xe federal government enlisted their help to get propane tanks to women living in villages who had been using smoke billowing indoor fires to cook the government wanted to install gas cylinders in million homes in three years and have public oil companies open thousands more centers nearby to sell them refills
socialcops went to work asking oil distributors to submit their gps coordinates using the company xe app they then incorporated data like populations affluence and distance from existing sales centers and made all the information easy to analyze to pinpoint the best locations for new centers and track the rollout of the connections in homes the company said the effort hooked up about million homes in its first year seven million more than the goal

alloysius attah grew up with his aunt farmer who grew corn cassava and yams in rural ghana xe cshe xe one of the hardest working and resilient people xe ve known xe he said xe ci was reluctant kid helping xe mr attah said farmers were more than half the country xe labor force and many tended to two to four acres their access to information is limited coming from local agriculture ministry offices or radio
mr attah now wants to give farmers the tools to become informed entrepreneurs increasing their crop yields and marketability to the lucrative export business ghana is one of the world xe top exporters of cocoa he said xe cit xe billions of dollar industry but when you look at the money that comes down to farmers xe they don xe get enough that xe why we help them to tap into the global market xe
in he started farmerline with his co founder emmanuel owusu addai which is based in ghana and has grown into company of employees farmers nearly universally own basic cellphones so farmerline delivers them prerecorded voice messages in their local language with localized weather forecasts and market prices for crops xe cit xe like podcast on xe dumb phone xe xe mr attah wrote in an email
the messages also share farming tips xe like how to get certified as fair trade farmers or increase crop yields by say pruning cacao trees to increase the growth of pods or how to meet the crop specifications for export markets
farmerline uses machine learning to predict the local demand for farming supplies like fertilizer and equipment to then negotiate better prices for good quality goods from distributors they also are using artificial intelligence to create credit score so farmers can take out loans to grow their business
over all it puts farmers xe cin position of power xe mr attah said xe cthey move from position of let me take what everybody gives me to let me choose because have options now you and have that xe
people love lists
we want to check out the best places to travel catch up with the best inventions of the last years be in the know about the best dressed people the best books the best schools and on and on
of course there is risk to listmaking maybe your choices won xe hold up over the years maybe the best book of decades ago seems not so great today
with the listmaking fervor and its risks in mind we searched for people who would fit our criteria for visionaries they had to be people who are forward looking working on exciting projects helping others or taking new direction we wanted diversity in gender race and ethnic background
we assigned writers who are knowledgeable about the subjects we deemed most important and we limited the list to
narrowing down the numbers was huge challenge and that xe good problem to have it means there are lot of people out there who are following their visions
we hope this inspires you to follow yours

digital assistants like amazon xe echo can listen to you and they can talk back but that doesn xe mean they can carry on good conversation
as the devices that run these assistants become more commonplace xe million americans now own one according to recent study xe amazon and competitors like apple and google foresee day when you can chat with their assistants like you would with friend
we explored the conversational limits of the leading assistants after consulting with the companies involved and few artificial intelligence experts we created tests that show what they can and can xe handle don xe expect the assistants to replace conversations with friends anytime soon but the experiments xe even in the moments when the assistants screwed up xe showed what these assistants could one day become in our lives
because these devices are not yet nimble enough to understand and respond to anything you might say amazon apple and google must hone them for particular tasks like playing song or building shopping list if you stick to these tasks the devices are pretty good at zeroing on what you want but even inside these small domains they can trip up listen how
right away the homepod showed how difficult it can be for machines to understand natural language the device recognized what we were doing but misunderstood how we wanted to do it and added an item called xe cthese things xe to shopping list
if your roommate asked what you wanted from the market and you said xe cguacamole chips tortillas xe he would understand that as three separate things but the google and amazon devices didn xe quite recognize the pause between items as verbal comma although these devices are pretty good at recognizing what you say they may not completely understand it
alexa grasped that we were continuing to add to the shopping list even though we weren xe explicit about it it held onto the context of the exchange and mapped our next request back to our list
digital assistant relies on many different technology systems all working together on the device and inside network of computer data centers that connect to the assistant over the internet
when you say something one system tries to recognize each word and convert it to text another system tries to understand the meaning of each word and how it relates to the others third system spits out new text that responds to what you xe ve said fourth converts this response to digital speech other systems may also weigh in but you get the point
engineers used to build speech recognition systems by writing one small computing rule at time xe painstaking process but so called neural networks are now replacing those hand written rules accelerating the progress of speech recognition neural networks are complex mathematical systems that can learn particular tasks by pinpointing patterns in large amounts of data they can learn to recognize spoken words for instance by analyzing recordings of old customer support calls
in some cases the assistants perform as well as human listeners but listening is only part of what they do
even if you make rather specific request it can have multiple meanings and that can be tough for an assistant to deal with
if you xe re sports fan you know there are two professional teams that call themselves the giants if someone asks about giants game in the summer you know they xe re talking about the san francisco giants who play baseball when we asked on august before pre season football started google home came to the same conclusion and the homepod asked that we identify the team we were talking about google and apple likely have written an explicit rule for this particular situation alexa guessed that we meant the new york giants football team which hadn xe played game in seven months but this may have been because we were asking the question in new york amazon sometimes generates responses based on your location in any case alexa figured out which team we meant after the next question
when we asked on august before pre season football started google home came to the same conclusion and the homepod asked that we identify the team we were talking about google and apple likely have written an explicit rule for this particular situation
alexa guessed that we meant the new york giants football team which hadn xe played game in seven months but this may have been because we were asking the question in new york amazon sometimes generates responses based on your location in any case alexa figured out which team we meant after the next question
when you chat with friend you use pronouns to keep up digital assistant must recognize pronouns for what they are and map them back to words in previous exchange algorithms are learning to identify pronouns by analyzing hundreds of sentences detecting patterns in the syntax
after recognizing what you say these devices must then understand what you want and generate response for that part companies like amazon and google have also begun to rely on neural networks to learn from what people have asked these digital assistants in the past
engineers might train one neural network to identify what you are trying to do build shopping list get the score of baseball game and train another to parse sentence and identify the nouns pronouns verbs and other parts of speech it xe like elementary school grammar classes for computers
all of the machine learning algorithms these devices use are liable to make mistakes though and the system can be brittle because so many different algorithms are trying to work in concert digital assistant may screw up if you make small change to request that has worked countless times in the past it may also screw up if you don xe change anything
machine learning algorithms can help these devices deal with turn by turn exchanges but each verbal exchange is limited to simple three or four turn conversation in perfect world engineers would build one giant neural network that learns to do everything for now these devices move toward better conversations in small steps
xe cif you keep your language short and simple you can maybe go as deep as three steps xe said nancy fulda researcher at brigham young university who specializes in conversational systems xe cthe technology operates by different rules than people do xe
in the previous example the devices understood what we were asking because they mapped pronoun back to the subject of our previous request but what if we don xe use pronoun
the devices correctly identified nearby shops but they were all different that xe likely because each device is using different xe cknowledge graph xe vast database of facts and other information you may ask for google for example may use data gathered from google maps whereas the other companies may pull from sources like yelp
amazon trains neural networks to recognize that this kind of pronoun free request refers back to the previous exchange the algorithms analyze hundreds perhaps thousands of requests like this and learns to identify them on its own when generating responses these assistants plug particular information into an existing template sometimes engineers will build this template to sound more conversational this seemed to be the case here when alexa said that traffic was xe csluggish xe
neural network also drives google xe new xe cconversational mode xe
in the past you couldn xe talk to the device without saying xe chey google xe now after saying this once you can deliver multiple commands and questions in some cases google home can recognize when you are delivering another command xe and when you xe re just talking to someone else in the room it does this with system that has been xe ctrained xe with the interactions other people have had with their devices basically google xe customers are helping google build smarter product
don xe expect these devices to tell you what they think xe or even what other people think it xe easier to build technology that sticks to the facts after asking these devices to identify the photographer robert mapplethorpe which they all did correctly we asked for their opinion of his work none of the machines seemed to grasp the concept of this question and google eventually lost the context altogether
engineers hope machine learning will continue to replace handwritten rules and expand what these devices can do but conversation is such complex task even machine learning approaches will need years xe or perhaps decades xe to completely solve the problem
these devices fall down in moments when they need to handle self reflection or complex analysis
this is an incredibly difficult question for computer to answer unless it has been specifically programmed to handle it many times these devices will just reply with canned responses as google did with the muffin man bit
leading researchers have built experimental neural networks that learn to carry on richer conversations by analyzing reams of real human dialogue like exchanges on twitter or facebook messenger but these neural networks can veer into nonsense they tend to reinforce the flaws of human conversation gender bias rudeness maybe even racism and they don xe dovetail very well with the structured systems that drive today xe digital assistants bridging the gap between these experiments and practical products like the amazon echo will take some time
for now you will have to make do with the muffin man
note the devices tested were the apple homepod the amazon echo plus and the google home they were each tested separately the phrases used to trigger the devices xe xe chey siri xe xe calexa xe and xe chey google xe respectively xe were used before each interaction and were removed from the audio recordings for clarity

for five and half years nearly the entire tenure of its chief executive virginia rometty ibm has reported steady erosion of revenue
selling off its chip manufacturing and smaller data center computer businesses contributed to the decline so too did the fact that new businesses like cloud computing data analytics and artificial intelligence had not yet grown big enough to make up for the downturn in ibm xe traditional hardware and software products
but ibm xe half decade losing streak will most likely end on thursday analysts predict when the company reports its quarterly performance
the crossover to growth would be long awaited bright spot for ms rometty and ibm challenged giant that has been overshadowed in recent years by the younger technology giants on the west coast
even if ibm delivers revenue gain however the bigger question facing the company remains has ms rometty turned it around
skeptics abound ibm is expected to have gotten an extra lift in the most recent quarter from currency gains and strong sales of new line of mainframe computers without that help the company xe revenue would decline by percent or so according to an estimate from sacconaghi financial analyst for sanford bernstein
xe cis turnaround afoot don xe see it yet xe mr sacconaghi said
there is no doubt though that there are signs of progress at ibm which would not comment on its financial picture before the release of the earning report so much attention is focused on the company xe top line because revenue is the broadest measure of the headway ibm is making in difficult transformation toward cloud computing data handling and offerings for corporate customers
the new businesses xe xe cstrategic imperatives xe ibm calls them xe now account for percent of the company xe revenue and though it still has ways to go ibm has steadily built up those operations xe and gained converts
the number of software developers using its cloud technology has doubled in the last year ibm says though it would not provide numbers on wednesday barclays upgraded ibm xe stock to buy and noted its long term opportunity in the cloud market ibm xe stock price notable laggard as markets have surged in recent years has climbed nearly percent so far this year
ibm was slow to recognize the significance of cloud computing and software tools delivered as internet style services in artificial intelligence the company scored research and public relations triumph in when its watson system defeated human champions in the question and answer game xe cjeopardy xe but ibm first applied the watson technology to the daunting realm of cancer research lengthy struggle with little short term financial reward
today ibm trails well behind amazon web services and microsoft in the cloud market according to analysts yet ibm has invested heavily in more than cloud data centers in countries in the past three years and the most recent analysis by idc technology research firm and report last month by jefferies wall street firm ranked ibm third in the category ahead of google
the watson technology has been retooled as dozens of different services including text understanding language translation image recognition and sentiment analysis xe all delivered via the cloud and available xc xa la carte
ibm xe strategy is to offer businesses cloud computing technology and industry expertise tailored for each customer big companies said david kenny senior vice president for ibm xe watson and cloud businesses are adapting cloud and technology to make their businesses faster and smarter
xe cwe start from our strength in knowing how enterprises operate xe mr kenny said xe cwe xe re trusted partner for companies in this data and wave xe
companies want to move quickly mr kenny said but they often want to exploit the speed and flexibility of cloud technology from within their own computer centers where they figure their vital business data is more secure
at amp began project with ibm last fall to accelerate the use of cloud technology in developing and updating the telecommunications giant xe in house software applications ibm xe longtime technology supplier to at amp xe was chosen both for its cloud expertise and its industry knowledge said sorabh saxena at amp xe president of business operations
the at amp ibm collaboration involves breaking down programs into cloud based building blocks of code called microservices each of which handles certain task so new feature for mobile payments for example can be adopted quickly by updating few lines of code rather than having to rewrite an entire program
most of this business software uses cloud technology that runs inside at amp data centers xe in so called private cloud in contrast to public cloud in which computing services are delivered from remote data centers owned by another company many corporations opt for private clouds to house their most sensitive customer and business data
xe cfor certain parts of our business ibm was the ideal partner xe mr saxena said
ibm emphasizes its hybrid stance in the cloud market offering both private and public cloud technology to its corporate clients in its financial reporting ibm also includes all the hardware software and services it sells to companies to build private clouds in its total cloud revenue which would put it on par with amazon
most industry analysts focus on the public cloud market assuming it will grow faster as companies build fewer data centers themselves in the public cloud market ibm has revenue of about billion year growing at percent according to the most recent estimate by idc by contrast amazon generates more than billion year and microsoft about billion
yet for ibm its underlying cloud software is crucial to building big business with watson xe cibm has strong set of assets in xe said ed anderson an analyst at gartner xe cand cloud is the answer to getting watson in the hands of developers xe
that was the appeal for opentopic start up that uses technology to mine online and corporate data for marketing insights opentopic switched from amazon web services to the ibm cloud in largely to tap watson xe code modules for text image and sentiment analysis so the opentopic developers had to write less code themselves
xe cit allows us to prototype rapidly xe said andre konig co founder of opentopic xe cand watson is the artificial intelligence layer that makes that possible xe
the start up xe clients include unilever abbott laboratories and the economist today opentopic does all its software development on the ibm cloud but that will most likely change soon
it is working with new company that runs its business on the amazon cloud xe cwe need to be where our customers are xe mr konig said xe cthe future is going to be multi cloud xe meaning businesses will use various services
his comment points to brewing issue for ibm xe and perhaps one that will help determine the resilience of ms rometty xe turnaround campaign
ibm is putting all its advanced technology on the cloud xe not just artificial intelligence but also blockchain and quantum computing if others are leaders in the underlying cloud layers why not focus higher up and distribute its leading edge technology on other clouds as well
ibm says its watson software for example is fine tuned down to the chip level for the ibm cloud but some analysts suggest that ibm may eventually take another path working with amazon microsoft and google
xe cif ibm does that xe said frank gens idc xe chief analyst xe cits chance of being cloud leader goes way up xe

known as mega round in silicon valley large scale fund raising is producing frenzy around tech companies with enough reach and momentum to absorb large check

by erin griffith
in late april when mike massaro set out to get million to million in funding for his payments start up flywire he contacted small group of investors he already knew but word quickly got around and other investors flooded his inbox with million of investment offers half of which he turned down
gusto payroll and benefits software company raised million in july but could have done five times that according to joshua reeves its chief executive and founder
convene real estate services start up recently obtained million and turned away more than million of additional investment soon after another wave of hopeful investors called asking if the company would be looking for more financing according to ryan simonetti convene xe chief executive
start ups raising million or more from investors xe known as mega round in silicon valley xe used to be rarity but now they are practically routine producing frenzy around tech companies with enough scale and momentum to absorb large check
the jump in oversize investments is led by relatively new investors including the japanese conglomerate softbank chinese companies and sovereign wealth funds they see chance to capitalize on tech xe incursion into just about every industry and want to put their money down before the young companies go public
by entering the tech market they have all but eliminated talk in silicon valley about an investment bubble xe leading concern couple of years ago xe because the money now seems almost limitless
for the start ups the pots of money are changing the normal way of building tech company they must move even faster expand their ambitions and collect more investment money than ever xe even if they might not be ready they risk becoming too reliant on funding and never finding path to profit
xe cif your competitor is going to raise million and you want to be conservative and only raise million you xe re going to get run over xe said bill gurley managing partner at benchmark capital
investors participated in record mega rounds last year according to the data provider crunchbase this year is on pace to easily eclipse that with completed in the first seven months of the year in july start ups reached more than financing deals worth combined billion new monthly high
in the last days letgo an online classifieds ads company raised million actifio data storage company took in million mydreamplus co working space start up secured million and klook travel activity booking site got million
these mega rounds have become so common that cb insights which tracks start up investments has even debated lifting its definition of mega round to million or more according to anand sanwal the firm xe chief executive
many of the new investors including softbank xe billion vision fund manage funds so large they dwarf the entire traditional venture capital market in the united states these giant funds are looking for start ups that can take large sums of money with one shot writing lots of small checks is too time consuming and the returns from small bets will not make difference for such big fund so investors are competing to back any start up that shows promise and the ability to put million or more to use
xe cas soon as they feel like they have winner they will really put lot of resources behind it xe said mr sanwal of cb insights
softbank xe deal making has affected every part of the venture capital market the arrival of its vision fund which has minimum investment size of million has prompted number of traditional venture capital firms including sequoia capital to build larger pools of money to compete funds from seven different firms are raising capital according to the data provider pitchbook
but the vision fund is not even the most active mega round investor in the first seven months of tencent holdings participated in rounds of funding of million or more compared with for softbank according to cb insights gic and temasek holdings investment funds associated with the government of singapore as well as alibaba and sequoia capital china have also been among the most active mega round investors this year
as result early investors must make sure their portfolio companies are friendly with the large funds laying groundwork for potential investment in the future
xe cit feels like there is bit of beauty pageant that early stage investors put on for the mega funds xe said patricia nakache general partner at trinity ventures
the hot funding market is pushing high growth start ups to change their plans flywire was not going to pursue more investment money until next year it still had million in the bank from previous funding round but the company saw xe cinvestment heat xe in the payments industry and mr massaro thought more money would help flywire grow even faster
funding rounds can take as long as six months to put together but flywire xe round wrapped up in just over two as result of the capital the company will complete some of its hiring plans in half the time it previously planned and expand into new geographic market two years early
moving aggressively is not choice well funded start ups called xe csuper haves xe by some investors can afford to pay their employees more and lower their prices losing money in the short term to win more customers
convene the real estate start up competes tangentially with wework an office rental company that has raised more than billion in funding from softbank and other investors convene was not planning to chase more capital until later this year but the company xe investors encouraged it to move sooner business deals move faster today than they did five years ago said mr simonetti the company xe chief executive and having extra capital on hand helps with speed
xe cthere xe definitely little bit of this xe let xe overcapitalize the company little bit so we can move quicker and faster xe xe he said
the large investors also demand big ideas from the start ups softbank xe vision fund team pushed tina sharkey chief executive of commerce start up brandless to share the most grandiose ambitious version of her business road map
xe cthey were like xe come on show us your real plan xe xe she said brandless had barely been operating for year before ms sharkey outlined an expansive vision to use machine learning data curation and community building to create efficiencies xe cwe didn xe have the gumption to say that to anyone else xe she said in july softbank invested million into her company
xe cin today xe hyper connected world companies need to hire scale and enter new markets faster than ever before or risk being surpassed by others xe said jeff housenbold managing partner at softbank investment advisers
few venture investors foresee slowdown in the pace of mega rounds those who once cautioned of tech bubble and subsequent crash have given up on their warnings in mr gurley of benchmark predicted xe cdead unicorns xe referring to start ups valued at billion or more but since the number of start ups worth billion or more has ballooned to from according to cb insights excess funding is tied to inflated valuations which may create problems when overvalued companies eventually try to go public
mr gurley said he was done trying to sound the alarm xe cyou have to adjust to the reality and play the game on the field xe he said
annie lamont managing partner at the venture fund oak hc ft expected drop off in start up valuations and funding three years ago but it never happened now she expects more of the same partly because most the companies can easily get more money and few are worried about downturn
xe cthe fear of correction is not occurring xe she said if any start ups do xe cvaporize xe she said xe ci think people are going to ignore them and roll right on to the next one xe
mitchell green managing partner at lead edge capital does not imagine slowdown unless interest rates increase significantly change that could prompt investors to move money into tax free bonds xe cit ain xe going to stop xe he said xe cthere xe too much money xe
mr reeves of software start up gusto acknowledged that founders who obtain outsize sums of capital can get caught up in xe cgrowth at any cost xe mentality that is why he chose not to maximize his funding round despite the intense interest xe cit xe up to the founder to realize that xe distraction xe he said xe csuccess is not having more money or bigger team but having more customers or revenue xe

san francisco xe the vast majority of videos removed from youtube toward the end of last year for violating the site xe content guidelines had first been detected by machines instead of humans the google owned company said on monday
youtube said it took down million videos during the fourth quarter of and about percent of those videos had initially been flagged by artificially intelligent computer systems
the new data highlighted the significant role machines xe not just users government agencies and other organizations xe are taking in policing the service as it faces increased scrutiny over the spread of conspiracy videos fake news and violent content from extremist organizations
those videos are sometimes promoted by youtube xe recommendation system and unknowingly financed by advertisers whose ads are placed next to them through an automated system
this was the first time that youtube had publicly disclosed the number of videos it removed in quarter making it hard to judge how aggressive the platform has previously been in removing content or the extent to which computers played part in making those decisions
figuring out how to remove unwanted videos xe and balancing that with free speech xe is major challenge for the future of youtube said eileen donahoe executive director at stanford university xe global digital policy incubator
xe cit xe basically free expression on one side and the quality of discourse that xe beneficial to society on the other side xe ms donahoe said xe cit xe hard problem to solve xe
youtube declined to disclose whether the number of videos it had removed had increased from the previous quarter or what percentage of its total uploads those million videos represented but the company said the takedowns represented xe ca fraction of percent xe of youtube xe total views during the quarter
betting on improvements in artificial intelligence is common silicon valley approach to dealing with problematic content facebook has also said it is counting on tools to detect fake accounts and fake news on its platform but critics have warned against depending too heavily on computers to replace human judgment
it is not easy for machine to tell the difference between for example video of real shooting and scene from movie and some videos slip through the cracks with embarrassing results last year parents complained that violent or provocative videos were finding their way to youtube kids an app that is supposed to contain only child friendly content that has automatically been filtered from the main youtube site
youtube has contended that the volume of videos uploaded to the site is too big of challenge to rely only on human monitors
still in december google said it was hiring people in to address policy violations across its platforms in blog post on monday youtube said it had filled the majority of the jobs that had been allotted to it including specialists with expertise in violent extremism counterterrorism and human rights as well as expanding regional teams it was not clear what youtube xe final share of the total would be
still youtube said three quarters of all videos flagged by computers had been removed before anyone had chance to watch them
the company xe machines can detect when person tries to upload video that has already been taken down and will prevent that video from reappearing on the site and in some cases with videos containing nudity or misleading content youtube said its computer systems are adept enough to delete the video without requiring human to review the decision
the company said its machines are also getting better at spotting violent extremist videos which tend to be harder to identify and have fairly small audiences
at the start of before youtube introduced so called machine learning technology to help computers identify videos associated with violent extremists percent of videos flagged and removed for that kind of content had fewer than views in the first quarter of the company said more than half of the videos flagged and removed for violent extremism had fewer than views
even so users still play meaningful role in identifying problematic content the top three reasons users flagged videos during the quarter involved content they considered sexual misleading or spam and hateful or abusive
youtube said users had raised million flags on roughly million videos during the quarter in total million videos were removed after first being flagged by users

when robo global xe team recently gathered at the new york stock exchange to celebrate the fifth anniversary of its robotics index and exchange traded fund it marked the event in true robotic fashion robot propped on table reached out its arm and rang the closing bell as company executives applauded wildly next to it
this clever eye catching gesture was aimed to show the world how easy xe and increasingly common xe it is for humans to work alongside robots
xe cit was symbolic xe said travis briggs chief executive of robo global xe operations in the united states xe cwe xe re in the first inning of this transition to automation and artificial intelligence and there is massive amount of growth potential xe
indeed robotics and automation are no longer viewed as passing fad or cool technology for geeks to gush over instead more companies are turning to artificial intelligence to boost productivity and stay relevant in fiercely competitive market experts call it the fourth industrial revolution and compare today xe robotics in the workplace to the early days of the internet
at recent conference hosted by robo global experts showed photos and videos of robotic prototypes of all shapes and sizes robots that climb stairs and around corners to find an object and laced pills that can retrieve foreign objects from person xe stomach they even included video of woman with electrodes attached to her head using thoughts to tell robot where to place an object
xe cwe xe re starting to see robots and automated systems penetrate every sector of the economy xe said jeremie capron director of research at robo global xe cthe pace of change is really accelerating so yes it xe revolution xe
robo global which researches advises and invests in robotics automation and companies knows all about the sector xe growth since setting up its robo global robotics amp automation index etf robo which tracks more than companies the corporation reports that its assets have soared to billion from million its first year
several other robotic etfs like ishares robotics and artificial intelligence etf irbo and global robotics amp artificial intelligence thematic etf botz have since been established to tap this growing sector
the phenomenon strikes both admiration and fear into nervous american work force video by boston dynamics showing human looking robots running and jumping over blocks drew more than five million views on youtube in one week this fall yet many americans who grew up watching science fiction and xe cterminator xe movies in which robots were the enemy worry about robots stealing their jobs
xe xe terminator xe and those kinds of images have significant impact on the way people perceive technology xe said raffaello xe andrea professor of dynamic systems and control at eth zurich university and co founder of kiva systems robotics company that was sold to amazon
recent report xe the future of jobs xe by the world economic forum forecasts that machines will perform more than half of all current workplace tasks by up from percent today it also predicts that million jobs will be displaced by but that million jobs will be created of the new jobs percent will require new skills
mckinsey global institute report is gloomier predicting that by as many as million people worldwide may have been displaced by automation and will need to find new jobs
the retail giant amazon was one of the earliest to embrace this technology with its million acquisition of kiva xe now called amazon robotics xe in amazon had been under pressure to deliver orders to its amazon prime customers within the promised hour window without losing money mr capron said amazon immediately deployed robots into its fulfillment centers
xe cwe need advanced technology and automation to meet customer demand xe it xe that simple xe said tye brady chief technologist at amazon robotics
the robots wander up and down the aisles bringing shelves of items directly to associates to package and ship significantly slashing costs and shortening the time to process and deliver an order today amazon has more than robots navigating fulfillment centers around the world
xe camazon delivered more than five billion items under two business days in to their prime program members based on our research including discussions with amazon robotics xe mr capron said all of this bolstered customer loyalty and demand resulting in more orders sales revenue and jobs
mr brady said it was myth that automation always destroys jobs
xe csince the acquisition of kiva we xe ve added full time jobs globally xe he said xe clast year alone we added xe
as robots have become faster smaller cheaper and safer in recent years more and more companies xe large and small xe have been seeking robotics to step up productivity increase precision or cut costs said stuart shepherd regional sales director for universal robots usa and chairman of the association for advancing automation
the average hourly cost of manufacturing worker to an employer is in the united states while the hourly cost of robot is according to recent pew research report
all axls machining business in dallas was struggling to find enough workers to operate its metal fabrication equipment and to sand and inspect metal parts manually for the medical aerospace defense and industrial sectors
without workers to run the machines and the assembly lines production lagged xe cafter we xe have skeleton shift with only half the machines running xe said gary kuzmin the company xe owner xe cit was costing me orders that couldn xe get to my customers on time xe
but then mr kuzmin discovered universal robots which makes collaborative robots or cobots which are small affordable and designed to operate safely side by side with workers they are easy to program to do multiple tasks and allow the company to crank out parts around the clock
after introducing the robots one job that was expected to take six months to complete was finished in less than half that time mr kuzmin said xe cwe saw percent profit increase on that job alone xe
the company became so adept at programming the robots for different jobs that it formed an all axls robotics unit which sells its specially programmed robots to other machine shops
mr kuzmin said the increased productivity allowed him to hire xe rather than fire xe more workers boosting his work force to from
early in another company zippertubing of chandler ariz was having tough time finding extra workers to help fulfill big automotive order for its cable management products
xe cwe had lot of people who would come in work for maybe week and then leave because they didn xe like the repetitive work environment xe said tim mead operations manager at zippertubing it brought in universal robots xe cobots and immediately saw productivity surge
xe cit used to take three people to do all of the operations that the robot now does xe mr mead said
the robots have also increased the company xe accuracy in spotting faulty manufactured parts when operators look at thousands of parts day they sometimes become xe csnow blind xe to defects mr mead said but that never happens to robots
in certain sectors xe consumer electronics automobile manufacturing and logistics xe xe cwe xe re moving into an era where automation has really gone from competitive advantage right now to absolutely necessary xe mr briggs said xe cautomate or fail xe
all of this has stoked fears especially among americans that robots automation and will throw millions of people onto the unemployment line
some industry experts play down these concerns saying that in any industrial revolution jobs are lost and new ones created
xe cfifty years ago or even years ago who knew what an app developer was or the amount of programming that we xe need xe mr briggs said
over the next decade the biggest job losses will most likely affect low skilled workers performing repetitive tasks like machine operators assembly line workers dishwashers drivers and preparers of fast food certain white collar areas like data entry accounting and payroll will suffer as well
demand however will probably surge for data analysts software developers web designers it experts commerce specialists health care providers entrepreneurs and social media experts according to the world economic forum report sectors that involve human skills like sales marketing customer service and even art and entertainment will also be in high demand the report said
while new jobs will offset losses retraining and education will be critical as many as million workers globally will need to change job categories and learn new skills to survive the transition according to the mckinsey global institute report
xe cthe days are gone where somebody learns to do task and that xe what they do for the rest of their life xe mr xe andrea said
how quickly and how deeply and robotics penetrate the job market will ultimately dictate how rapidly people need to be retrained
xe chistory tells me that every prior technological revolution has resulted in more wealth and more jobs xe mr capron said xe cso it would have to be very different this time around for history not to repeat itself xe
but has its critics the visionary billionaire elon musk has described it as humanity xe xe cbiggest existential threat xe while the renowned physicist stephen hawking who died this year predicted that xe cthe development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race xe mr musk is particularly concerned about the use of to develop autonomous lethal weapons that could select targets without human intervention xe development with potentially apocalyptic repercussions
mr xe andrea said was long way off from being real threat he does believe however that regulations will be needed to safeguard its use in autonomous weapons
mr briggs was less concerned xe ci think elon musk is being overly dramatic xe he said noting that he did not believe that should be regulated xe ci think regulation is slippery slope xe it certainly stifles creativity xe
because of an editing error an earlier version of picture caption with this article misstated the company that owns robot that rang the bell at the new york stock exchange it is owned by universal robots not by robo global
in an earlier version of this article the second reference to professor at eth zurich university and co founder of kiva systems robotics company was incorrect it was mr xe andrea not mr raffaella

exchange traded funds became the next big thing in portfolio management couple of decades ago by being cheaper and easier to trade than mutual funds
these days some managers are offering as tools for specialization at the expense of diversification carving up the stock market into ever thinner slices for investors eager to find other next big things
have evolved from covering only broad indexes such as the amp to sectors like energy and health care industries like homebuilding and gold mining and lately to subsets of industries xe niches within niches xe often in ultracool areas like robotics cybersecurity and video gaming that capture investors xe imaginations and then their money
while investment advisers occasionally use thematic funds when managing assets for their clients they typically encourage small investors to avoid the practice no matter how enticing it might be to try to find the next amazon netflix or google before it becomes technological colossus
xe cwe would prefer that someone build portfolio around more diversified funds xe said jason browne chief investment strategist of the fundx investment group firm that manages fund portfolios for high net worth individuals he warned xe cif you xe re an average investor you will probably look back and think this is something you were sold and not something thoughtfully invested in that xe aligned with your long term goals xe
like mr browne christopher cordaro chief investment officer of regentatlantic morristown financial planning firm said he sees more fund marketing than fund management at work with narrowly focused
xe cit sort of reminds me of xe the graduate xe when the guy takes benjamin aside and says xe xe ve got one word plastics xe xe mr cordaro said providers of these funds xe care looking for things that sound good to people then they give them an itch they xe ll want to scratch xe
sam masucci chief executive of the etf managers group which manages about billion across thematic portfolios said funds dedicated to such narrow market segments are especially dependent on investor demand and are introduced in areas experiencing surge in popularity
his company xe thematic funds are mix of actively managed and passively managed portfolios in addition to cybersecurity and gaming funds they cover some highly focused even obscure industries including mobile payments and drone technology and for anyone worried that all that cutting edge technology will make human beings too efficient and productive the company also offers the alternative harvest fund which invests in companies involved in marijuana production
anyone interested in these areas despite admonitions like mr browne xe has several alternatives to choose from
recent report on thematic by todd rosenbluth director of and mutual fund research at cfra research highlighted two gaming funds xe vaneck vectors video gaming and esports and etfmg video game tech xe and two that invest in cybersecurity etfmg prime cyber security and first trust nasdaq cybersecurity
the report also mentioned four that cover the burgeoning field of robotics robo global robotics and automation index global robotics and artificial intelligence first trust nasdaq artificial intelligence and robotics and ishares robotics and artificial intelligence
the performance of many of them last year illustrates the perils of owning an idea that would seem to have lot of promise but so far has not delivered on it the amp fell percent last year and the nasdaq composite index benchmark for technology stocks lost percent the etfmg gaming fund lagged both indexes badly losing percent while the vaneck gaming fund was down percent just since its introduction in mid october
the cybersecurity funds did much better etfmg prime security rose percent in and the first trust fund eked out percent gain
as for the robotics portfolios their returns have been awful none of the four came close to matching the nasdaq index losses last year ranged between percent and percent
because interest in these areas tends to come and go mr browne uses thematic to carry out short term asset allocation decisions haim israel head of thematic investing at bank of america merrill lynch by contrast views several technologies covered by the as long term opportunities
the business and investment prospects associated with themes like big data artificial intelligence privacy and cyberthreats the report said will be helped by xe ctechceleration xe resulting from the introduction of so called technology featuring much faster data transmission rates the rollout of xe cwill bring about the fastest transformation in human history xe mr israel predicted the reduced time it will take to transmit data will help the spread of all sorts of technologies like gaming or self driving cars he said
mr israel xe analysis and outlook are plausible xe for the world as it is today and for various technologies as they have developed so far as for five years from now who knows change often radical and unforeseeable is hallmark of the sector making most forecasts speculative at best that is one of the main complaints that investment advisers have with thematic
xe cwe xe ve been around long enough to see lot of the xe next big thing xe said leon labrecque chief executive of ljpr financial advisors in troy mich xe cremember blockbuster or boston chicken anyone remember the first search engine new tech becomes old tech xe
for investors interested in taking shot with thematic advisers suggest using risk capital and then only small amounts of it
mr masucci views thematic as superior alternatives to buying individual stocks these xe care tax efficient liquid transparent way to give that exposure without relying on advisers xe ability to pick stocks xe he said
but mr cordaro pointed to conundrum that anyone contemplating investing in thematic faces xe cbecause they can be riskier you wouldn xe want them to be too much of your portfolio xe no more than percent he said xe cthe paradox is that xe not going to move the needle that much you xe re not going to make much money on it xe
if you still want to try to move the needle he advises doing it with funds that emphasize smaller younger businesses that are pure plays in particular niche and that don xe fill their portfolios with established companies that only dabble in fledgling technology
mr rosenbluth noted in his report for instance that the vaneck and etfmg gaming funds both hold the gaming stocks activision and electronic arts but only the etfmg fund owns the larger more diversified tech stocks apple and microsoft by contrast the etfmg cybersecurity portfolio is more skewed toward smaller software companies than first trust nasdaq cybersecurity while the latter holds more in big defense companies like raytheon than the etfmg fund does
as for the robotics funds the two with portfolios published on third party sites like morningstar xe robo global robotics and global robotics each own big companies like nvidia and intuitive surgical and smaller ones like helix energy solutions
in the end the most effective way to invest in the next big thing may be to avoid trying to do it through thematic at all
xe cwhy even go for that ride is the question xe mr browne said when you own diversified fund xe cwhatever drives the economy is going to be in your portfolio it doesn xe rely on your or my predictions of what that xe going to be xe
mr labrecque recommended similarly broad simple approach
xe cwe can buy the amp and get the new fangs xe reference to facebook amazon netflix and google xe cand the next acronym of choice xe he said xe cand we can get the companies that make all the stuff people buy on amazon and the cars people drive to the store to buy the food to eat while they watch netflix and when the next thing comes along we can own that as well xe

san francisco xe waymo and uber settled their legal fight on friday nearly year after waymo first accused the ride hailing company of plotting to steal important self driving car technology
after four days of arguments and testimony in federal district court here uber agreed to provide waymo the self driving car unit under google xe parent company alphabet with percent of its stock according to waymo the settlement xe terms value uber at billion meaning the alphabet unit xe stake is worth about million
the settlement closes legal fight that riveted silicon valley it pitted the most successful company from the dot com era against this generation xe biggest start up in fight over autonomous vehicles xe potentially trillion dollar industry that is expected to transform transportation
the trial also offered peek into how silicon valley really works the rise of promising start ups that challenge incumbents the inner workings of rich but often chaotic technology companies the complicated rivalries among billionaire tech entrepreneurs and the costly competition for engineering talent
the dispute between the two companies started in after uber acquired otto start up making self driving trucks that was founded by anthony levandowski an early member of google xe self driving car project uber agreed to pay reported million for otto just six months after it was founded
but waymo xe which was spun out from google in late xe claimed the deal was part of plan to steal its laser sensor technology key component for operating self driving cars mr levandowski had begun talking with travis kalanick uber xe chief executive at the time about the possibility of working together on autonomous vehicle technology while he was still employed at google according to evidence presented at the trial
mr levandowski was accused of downloading thousands of google files related to self driving car technology before he left the company uber learned about what he had done but still went ahead with the deal waymo claimed that was the basis of waymo xe claim that uber had misappropriated eight trade secrets related mainly to lidar xe an abbreviation for xe clight detection and ranging xe xe sensors that help self driving cars see the world around them
the first few days of the trial revealed number of embarrassing details connecting uber with mr levandowski however waymo had yet to deliver on the substantive legal part of the argument that uber knowingly stole waymo xe trade secrets for use in its products the judge william alsup admonished waymo xe lawyers on wednesday for not having made much progress on its trade secret misappropriation claims
before the trial started uber offered to settle with waymo in exchange for percent of the company xe equity or about million but its board of directors pulled the offer and allowed mr kalanick to testify according to two people familiar with uber xe thinking who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter
after testimony on thursday settlement talks restarted and uber offered the lower percentage these people said for waymo the financial terms were not as important as scoring concessions on not using waymo xe technology said person familiar with waymo xe deliberations who was not authorized to discuss them
the settlement included an agreement that none of waymo xe confidential information was being incorporated in uber xe autonomous vehicle technology
after almost decade of work on self driving cars the uber stake may be the first substantial money that waymo has made from the technology alphabet was already major investor in uber through its venture capital arm gv it has also made billion dollar investment in uber xe main rival in the united states lyft
although it settled the lawsuit waymo xe court fight may have succeeded in embarrassing rival while delivering unspoken warning to former and current employees to be cautious about leaving the company with know how developed there it also struck deal before larry page alphabet xe chief executive who rarely speaks in public had to testify in court next week
waymo xe lawyers presented evidence that entertained the throngs of technology reporters gathered to cover the trial including texts and emails between mr levandowski and mr kalanick using chest puffing terms like xe cburn the village xe and xe csecond place is first xe loser there were also pictures of notes on whiteboards from brainstorming xe cjam sesh xe led by mr kalanick declaring among other things that xe claser is the sauce xe
the settlement helps resolve one of uber xe many lingering issues from mr kalanick xe tumultuous time as chief executive which ended in june his successor dara khosrowshahi has said he hopes to change the perception that uber has been too quick to break rules
the settlement also clears away significant legal risk as uber prepares for an expected initial public offering it is still dealing with department of justice investigation into its business practices although the company insists it did not take any waymo trade secrets mr khosrowshahi said in statement that he regretted the events that led to the litigation
xe cmy job as uber xe is to set the course for the future of the company innovating and growing responsibly as well as acknowledging and correcting mistakes of the past xe he said in the statement xe cthe prospect that couple of waymo employees may have inappropriately solicited others to join otto and that they may have potentially left with google files in their possession in retrospect raised some hard questions xe
mr kalanick released statement that was not nearly as conciliatory
xe cno trade secrets ever came to uber xe the statement said xe cthe evidence at trial overwhelmingly proved that and had the trial proceeded to its conclusion it is clear uber would have prevailed xe
the loser in the legal proceeding may be mr levandowski who was fired by ube over his refusal to cooperate with the company xe defense an uber spokesman matt kallman said the company had fired mr levandowski in may before otto could meet any of its performance targets as result he lost out on an estimated million worth of equity in uber xe almost exactly how much uber paid waymo
judge alsup referred mr levandowski xe case to the justice department although it was not clear whether criminal case was being pursued against him mr levandowski who received million bonus for his work on google xe self driving car was expected to refuse to answer questions if he had taken the stand as scheduled next week

that responds to your voice next generation wireless networks if this year xe biggest consumer technology trends have familiar ring there xe reason for that
by brian chen
imagine future where you are never truly alone even when your spouse is on business trip or your children are away at summer camp you will always have someone or something to talk to in the morning you could ask the microwave to heat up bowl of oatmeal in your car you could tell your stereo to put on some xe music and when you walk into the office you could ask your smartphone xe cwhat xe on my calendar today xe
this is increasingly the world the tech industry is building with bloating portfolio of devices that can react to voice commands xe and that the companies will be pitching to you even more in
the future will be on display next week at ces consumer electronics trade show in las vegas that serves as window into the year xe hottest tech trends artificially intelligent virtual assistants will take center stage as the most important tech topic with companies big and small expected to showcase voice controlled devices like robot vacuums alarm clocks refrigerators and car accessories most of these products will be powered by amazon xe alexa or google xe assistant the two most popular artificially intelligent assistants industry insiders said
xe ca will pervade the show xe said gary shapiro chief executive of the consumer technology association which owns ces
if this all sounds like repeat of last year that xe because much of it is artificial intelligence was xe hottest tech trend too in other words the tech industry is in state of iteration rather than making leaps and bounds with something totally new
other tech trends that are progressing include the debut this year of fifth generation cellular networks known as which will significantly quicken mobile internet speeds cybersecurity products for home networks are also proliferating an important safeguard now that consumers own so many devices that can connect to the internet
but as is often the case there will also be plenty of talk in the coming week about overly optimistic tech that you would do best to sidestep for now that xe because some of the most hyped technologies xe especially self driving cars xe are so far from reality that you won xe see them in stores or dealerships anytime soon
here xe what to watch and what to avoid
in amazon birthed the echo the artificially intelligent speaker featuring the virtual assistant known as alexa year later google responded with home its smart speaker powered by google xe own digital companion called assistant
since then in bid to become your go to digital companion the two tech giants have teamed up with makers of devices like thermostats doorbells light bulbs and car accessories to add their virtual assistants to them
google is expected to be even more aggressive this year with its assistant the company will triple the size of its presence at ces this year suggesting that it is likely to unveil large array of products that work with assistant
xe cwe xe re really leaning into the assistant as the best way to get things done helping you for lots of things as you go about your day xe said nick fox google executive who oversees assistant
amazon said it would also showcase wide range of technologies that work with alexa next week as part of vision it calls alexa everywhere the company xe goal is to expand the reach of its virtual assistant into every part of people xe lives including the kitchen the living room the office and the car
for you and me here xe cautionary note virtual assistants are still in their infancy and have many shortcomings we have to speak very specific command to trigger virtual assistant to control device like setting the temperature on thermostat or turning on lamp those unfamiliar with the lingo may find the devices even more difficult to use than pressing button inside an app
xe cwe still have to learn their language and they have not learned our language xe said frank gillett tech analyst for forrester technology research company
lost in the hype about virtual assistants is whether people truly want an omnipresent companion involved in their everyday tasks owners of smart speakers mostly summoned digital assistants for basic functions like listening to music checking the weather and setting timer according to research by nielsen last year
plenty of people install antivirus software on their computers but what about all the other devices that can be connected to the internet like smart watches phones televisions and speakers
in an era of smart things the wi fi router is becoming bigger target for hackers so expect flood of new equipment and software that offer protection by improving your network security
for sense of what to expect consider eero plus subscription service that eero maker of wi fi equipment released last year eero plus includes protection against viruses and malware for all the devices connected to its wi fi network last year netgear released netgear armor similar security service
more should follow this year xe beginning next week at ces where scalys networking company plans to introduce trustbox router with built in security features
this year the wireless industry will begin big upgrade to its infrastructure phone carriers like at amp and verizon wireless say the technology will deliver data at incredibly fast speeds allowing people to download entire movies in few seconds
in addition to increasing smartphone speeds will be important for other types of devices like robots self driving cars drones and security cameras the technology is expected to greatly reduce latency or the time it takes for devices to communicate with one another
but don xe get too excited carriers say the new network technology will be deployed this year in only few cities in the united states and in some parts of britain germany switzerland china south korea and australia
and not many smartphones will be compatible with initially some chinese handset makers and samsung electronics have said they will release their first smartphones this year apple is not expected to release compatible iphone until
xe cfor the early adopters with deep pockets that xe great xe mr gillett said xe cfor the rest of us big whoop xe
virtual reality and self driving cars have been talked about lot in recent years and they will still be talked about this year but these two technologies are still nascent or premature
over the last two years tech companies like facebook xe oculus htc google and samsung have flooded the market with virtual reality headsets and plenty of software and games yet people have not exactly embraced the products
xe cthe industry has been plagued by high cost hardware motion sickness dearth of compelling content and general lack of consumer interest xe said victoria petrock an analyst for the research firm emarketer in recent post
self driving cars are also still many years from becoming mainstream even though some companies have permits to test autonomous cars in california arizona and elsewhere several of the leaders in the technology xe such as alphabet xe waymo xe have refrained from committing to release date for self driving vehicles
xe cthere xe going to be lot of noise about automotive technology but nothing distinct or specific xe mr gillett said

by paul bloom and sam harris
paul bloom is psychologist sam harris is neuroscientist
suppose we had robots perfectly identical to men women and children and we were permitted by law to interact with them in any way we pleased how would you treat them
that is the premise of xe cwestworld xe the popular hbo series that opened its second season sunday night and plot twists of season aside it raises fundamental ethical question we humans in the not so distant future are likely to face
based on the film xe cwestworld xe depicts futuristic playground modeled after the wild west where the characters xe bartenders prostitutes sheriffs bandits xe are robotic xe chosts xe programmed to interact as naturally as possible with their human guests these intelligent machines look and act exactly like people indeed viewers are often confused or misled about who is host and who is person
the guests can behave however they please some assume heroic roles but others choose to act out their darkest impulses participating in torture rape and murder xe including the murder of robots that are indistinguishable from human children the hosts have been designed so that they can xe harm the guests so these are acts of pure sadism without risk of reprisal
it xe hardly spoiler to say that things go wrong for the humans in xe cwestworld xe but we are interested here in the show xe premise xe and what our reaction as viewers to these lifelike robots suggests about human nature and the future of technology
the biggest concern is that we might one day create conscious machines sentient beings with beliefs desires and most morally pressing the capacity to suffer nothing seems to be stopping us from doing this philosophers and scientists remain uncertain about how consciousness emerges from the material world but few doubt that it does this suggests that the creation of conscious machines is possible
suppose as many philosophers and scientists believe that consciousness arises in sufficiently complex system that processes information there is no reason to think that such system need be made of meat conscious minds are most likely platform independent xe ultimately the product of the right software it seems only matter of time before we either emulate the workings of the human brain in our computers or build conscious minds of another sort
and even if one believes that only biological systems can be conscious this development too lies within our reach xe perhaps through combination of artificial intelligence and genetic engineering indeed in xe cwestworld xe it xe hinted that the hosts are partly biological we certainly see them bleed
if we did create conscious beings conventional morality tells us that it would be wrong to harm them xe precisely to the degree that they are conscious and can suffer or be deprived of happiness just as it would be wrong to breed animals for the sake of torturing them or to have children only to enslave them it would be wrong to mistreat the conscious machines of the future
but how will we know if our machines become conscious descartes argued that one xe own consciousness is beyond any possibility of doubt in the case of others we xe re never absolutely sure many of us have entertained if only for moment the idea that everyone else might be zombie laughing crying complaining rejoicing but with no one home perhaps scientists will eventually discover the signature of consciousness and then we will be able to test for it in our robots as well as in animals and one another but it is certain that we will build machines that seem conscious long before we arrive at that point
anything that looks and acts like the hosts on xe cwestworld xe will appear conscious to us whether or not we understand how consciousness emerges in physical systems indeed experiments with ai and robotics have already shown how quick we are to attribute feelings to machines that look and behave like independent agents multiply that temptation to anthropomorphize thousandfold think not of machine with visible wires cartoonish eyes and voice that sounds like siri but of beautiful stranger who engages you in intelligent conversation and who may be more aware of your emotions than your spouse or best friends ever were it would be irresistible to see this creature as person whatever your philosophical views and regardless of what its creators told you about how it was built
this is where actually watching xe cwestworld xe matters the pleasure of entertainment aside the makers of the series have produced powerful work of philosophy it xe one thing to sit in seminar and argue about what it would mean morally if robots were conscious it xe quite another to witness the torments of such creatures as portrayed by actors such as evan rachel wood and thandie newton you may still raise the question intellectually but in your heart and your gut you already know the answer
watching the show you also discover how you feel about the people who rape torture and kill these robots we have no idea how many people would actually behave this way in place like westworld the show implies that there xe no shortage of such customers but there is something repugnant about those who do in this scenario the robot hosts are the most human and the humans who abuse them are monsters
kant had odd views about animals seeing them as mere things devoid of moral value but he insisted on their proper treatment because of the implications for how we treat one another xe cfor he who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men xe we could surely say the same for the treatment of lifelike robots even if we could be certain that they weren xe conscious and couldn xe really suffer their torture would very likely harm the torturer and ultimately the other people in his life
this may seem like an extreme version of the worry that many have about violent video games it has long been speculated that enacting violence in virtual world desensitizes people to violence in the real one the evidence for such an effect turns out to be weak in fact as video games have become increasingly realistic the rate of violent crime has dropped
but the prospect of building place like xe cwestworld xe is much more troubling because the experience of harming host isn xe merely similar to that of harming person it xe identical we have no idea what repeatedly indulging such fantasies would do to us ethically or psychologically xe but there seems little reason to think that it would be good
the issues here extend beyond sadism machines are created to improve the lives of human beings and one of the attractions of advanced ai is the prospect of robot maids butlers and chauffeurs also known as self driving cars this is all fine with the sorts of machines we currently have but as ai improves we run moral risk
after all if we do manage to create machines as smart as or smarter than we are xe and more important machines that can feel xe it xe hardly clear that it would be ethical for us to use them to do our bidding even if they were programmed to enjoy such drudgery the notion of genetically engineering race of willing slaves is standard trope of science fiction wherein humankind is revealed to have done something terrible why would the production of sentient robot slaves be any different
for the first time in our history then we run the risk of building machines that only monsters would use as they please

hi xe jamie condliffe greetings from london here xe look at the week xe tech news
machines are more than ever controlled by software not humans occasionally it goes fatally wrong
on march people died when an ethiopian airlines boeing max jet crashed five months earlier another crash of the same model of airplane killed people there are indications that software intended to prevent the jets from stalling may have played role in both accidents
reporting by the new york times suggests that the software didn xe receive detailed review by the federal aviation administration before it entered use under new rules the agency delegated much of the responsibility to boeing if the software was at fault and the problem did slip through the regulatory net it raises questions about how safety critical technology is vetted
those questions will become more important over the next few years
year ago an arizona woman was struck and killed by one of uber xe autonomous cars the vehicle xe autonomy systems failed to brake as did the safety driver behind the wheel
companies like uber and waymo along with most of the auto industry expect autonomous cars to proliferate over the next decade such advances aren xe limited to cars xe they will further automate everything from air travel to food delivery they are built on technologies like artificial intelligence that will make split second decisions for humans
the boeing software was designed to perform simple task nudge the airplane xe nose down based on sensor readings if stall was anticipated as harder tasks are handed to software the stakes rise
xe cas you create more advanced systems the harm that can result from them failing can be really large xe said jade leung researcher at oxford university xe center for the governance of artificial intelligence
but increasing the complexity of systems makes checking them more difficult hardware from chips to special sensors can be difficult to test and it can be difficult for humans to understand how some algorithms make decisions
ms leung said regulators needed to be more aware of tail end risks xe the highly unlikely but catastrophic events that could occur if something malfunctioned that might mean introducing more conservative rules that relax as technology matures ideally developed in tandem with technologists who understand deeply how the systems work
xe cverifying the performance and safety of software is really really hard technical challenge xe ms leung said nonetheless it xe challenge that has to be addressed
when company spends billions on world leading digital infrastructure it naturally wants to wring every last cent of revenue out of it that xe partly what is driving google xe new stadia gaming service announced on tuesday
google xe pitch is straightforward think of it as netflix for gaming as long as they have fast internet connection users can pay subscription to play high definition games akin to what they xe find on current top end consoles on any computer phone or tablet
the company xe promise that its cloud infrastructure makes that achievable it will add racks of gaming specific chips to existing server farms to essentially give people an on demand remote gaming computer and google officials believe that since most users are now so close to its pervasive hardware lag won xe be problem xe an issue that held back earlier game streaming platforms like the now defunct onlive
google is not alone in the push into what some people see as the future of gaming microsoft had already announced that it planned to offer trial of similar service for xbox consoles computers and mobile devices this year amazon which owns the game watching service twitch is widely believed to be planning something similar built on its amazon web services cloud infrastructure
those three companies happen to be the world xe largest cloud providers it xe not surprising that they xe re enamored of the idea of taking slice of the billion gaming industry when all it could take is the flex of an existing muscle
about million should buy lot of computer this past week we found out how much writing for the times don clark explained what the department of energy would get for dropping that sum on supercomputer

san francisco xe two technology booms xe some people might call them frenzies xe are combining to turn once obscure type of microprocessor into must have but scarce commodity
artificial intelligence systems made by companies ranging in size from google to the chinese start up malong technologies rely heavily on computer chip called graphics processing unit or the chips are also very useful in mining digital currencies like ethereum bitcoin alternative riding the same wave of hype as its more famous cousin
with people and companies involved in the two surging tech niches buying up the same chips have been in short supply over the past several months prices have increased by as much as percent according to some resellers and customers
xe cthe chips are simply going out of stock xe said matt scott technologist from the united states who founded malong after leaving microsoft xe research lab in beijing in xe cand the problem is getting worse xe
malong based in shenzhen is building system that can analyze digital photos and learn to recognize objects doing so requires an enormous number of photos and analyzing all these photos depends on the chip
when the company recently ordered new hardware from supplier in china the shipment was delayed by four weeks and the price of the chips was about percent higher than it had been six months earlier
xe cwe need the latest to stay competitive xe mr scott said xe cthere is tangible impact to our research work xe
but he did not blame other specialists for the shortage he blamed cryptocurrency miners xe cwe have never had this problem before xe he said xe cit was only when crypto got hot that we saw significant slowdown in our ability to get xe
were originally designed to render graphics for computer games and other software in recent years they have become an essential tool in the creation of artificial intelligence almost every company relies on the chips
like malong those companies build what are called neural networks complex algorithms that learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data large numbers of which consume relatively little electrical power and can be packed into small space can process the huge amounts of math required by neural networks more efficiently than standard chips
speculators in digital currency are snapping up for very different purpose after setting up machines that help run the large computer networks that manage ethereum and other bitcoin alternatives people and businesses can receive payment in the form of newly created digital coins are also efficient for processing the math required for this digital mining
crypto miners bought three million boards xe flat panels that can be added to personal and other computers xe worth million last year said jon peddie researcher who has tracked sales of the chips for decades
that may not sound like lot in an overall market worth more than billion but the combination of builders and crypto miners xe not to mention gamers xe has squeezed the supply things have gotten so tight that resellers for nvidia the silicon valley chip maker that produces percent of the boards often restrict how many company can buy each day
xe cit is tough moment xe said kevin scott microsoft xe chief technology officer xe cwe could do more if we had more of these xe chips in data centers xe cthere are real products that could be getting better right now for real users this is not theoretical exercise xe
amd another supplier and other companies say some of the current shortage is result of limited worldwide supply of other components on boards and they note that retail prices have begun to stabilize but in march at his company xe annual chip conference in silicon valley nvidia xe chief executive jen hsun huang indicated that the company still could not produce the chips fast enough
this has created an opportunity for many other chip makers company called bitmain for instance has released new chip specifically for mining ethereum coins google has built its own chip for work on and is giving other companies access to it through cloud computing service last month facebook indicated in series of online job postings that it too was working to build chip just for
dozens of other companies are designing similar chips that take the already specialized into smaller niches and more companies producing chips means greater supply and lower prices
xe cyou want this not just for economic reasons but for supply chain stability xe said mr scott of microsoft
the market will not diversify overnight matthew zeiler the chief executive and founder of computer vision start up in new york said the prices of some of the boards that the company uses have risen more than percent since last year
mr zeiler believes that nvidia will be very hard to unseat many companies will stick with the nvidia xe technology because that is what they are familiar with and because the boards it provides can do more than one thing
kevin zhang the founder of abc consulting has bought thousands of for mining various digital currencies he said that chip just for say mining ethereum was not necessarily an attractive option for miners it cannot be used to mine other currencies and the groups that run systems like ethereum often change the underlying technology which can make dedicated chips useless
interest in digital currency mining could cool of course but the and gaming markets will continue to grow
mr zeiler said that his company had recently bought new for its data center in new jersey but could not install them for more than month because the computer racks needed to house the chips were in short supply as result of the same market pressures
xe cthe demand xe he said xe cis definitely crazy xe

san francisco xe google hoping to head off rebellion by employees upset that the technology they were working on could be used for lethal purposes will not renew contract with the pentagon for artificial intelligence work when current deal expires next year
diane greene who is the head of the google cloud business that won contract with the pentagon xe project maven said during weekly meeting with employees on friday that the company was backing away from its work with the military according to person familiar with the discussion but not permitted to speak publicly about it
google xe work with the defense department on the maven program which uses artificial intelligence to interpret video images and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes roiled the internet giant xe work force many of the company xe top researchers in particular worried that the contract was the first step toward using the nascent technology in advanced weapons
but it is not unusual for silicon valley xe big companies to have deep military ties and the internal dissent over maven stands in contrast to google xe biggest competitors for selling cloud computing services xe amazon com and microsoft xe which have aggressively pursued pentagon contracts without pushback from their employees
google xe self image is different xe it once had motto of xe cdon xe be evil xe number of its top technical talent said the internet company was betraying its idealistic principles even as its business minded officials worried that the protests would damage its chances to secure more business from the defense department
about google employees signed petition demanding xe ca clear policy stating that neither google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology xe handful of employees also resigned in protest while some were openly advocating the company to cancel the maven contract
months before it became public senior google officials were worried about how the maven contract would be perceived inside and outside the company the new york times reported this week by courting business with the pentagon they risked angering number of the company xe highly regarded researchers who had vowed that their work would not become militarized
jim mattis the defense secretary had reached out to tech companies and sought their support and cooperation as the pentagon makes artificial intelligence centerpiece of its weapons strategy the decision made by google on friday is setback to that outreach
but if google drops out of some or all of the competition to sell the software that will guide future weaponry the pentagon is likely to find plenty of other companies happy to take the lucrative business defense department spokeswoman did not reply to request for comment on friday
ms greene xe comments were reported earlier by gizmodo
the money for google in the project maven contract was never large by the standards of company with revenue of billion last year xe million one official told employees or possible million over months according to an internal email
but some company officials saw it as an opening to much greater revenue down the road in an email last september google official in washington told colleagues she expected maven to grow into million year project and eventually it could have helped open the door to contracts worth far more notably multiyear multibillion dollar cloud computing project called jedi or joint enterprise defense infrastructure
whether google xe maven decision is short term reaction to employee protests and adverse news coverage or reflects more sweeping strategy not to pursue military work is unclear the question of whether particular contract contributes to warfare does not always have simple answer
when the maven work came under fire inside google company officials asserted that it was not xe coffensive xe in nature but maven is using the company xe artificial intelligence software to improve the sorting and analysis of imagery from drones and some drones rely on such analysis to identify human targets for lethal missile shots
google management had told employees that it would produce set of principles to guide its choices in the use of artificial intelligence for defense and intelligence contracting at friday xe meeting ms greene said the company was expected to announce those guidelines next week
google has already said that the new artificial intelligence principles under development precluded the use of in weaponry but it was unclear how such prohibition would be applied in practice and whether it would affect google xe pursuit of the jedi contract
defense department officials are themselves wrestling with the complexity of their move into cloud computing and artificial intelligence critics have questioned the proposal to give the entire jedi contract which could extend for years to single vendor this week officials announced they were slowing the contracting process down
dana white the pentagon spokeswoman said this week that the jedi contract had drawn xe cincredible interest xe and more than responses to draft request for proposals but she said officials wanted to take their time
xe dso we are working on it but it xe important that we don xe rush toward failure xe ms white said xe cthis is different for us we have lot more players in it this is something different from some of our other acquisition programs because we do have great deal of commercial interest xe
ms greene said the company probably would not have sought the maven work if company officials had anticipated the criticism according to notes on ms greene xe remarks taken by google employee and shared with the times
another person who watched the meeting added that ms greene said maven had been xe cterrible for google xe and that the decision to pursue the contract was done when google was more aggressively going after military work
google does other more innocuous business with the pentagon including military advertising on google properties and google xe ad platform as well as providing web apps like email
meredith whittaker google researcher who was openly critical of the maven work wrote on twitter that she was xe cincredibly happy about this decision and have deep respect for the many people who worked and risked to make it happen google should not be in the business of war xe
even though the internal protest has carried on for months there was no indication that employee criticism of the deal was dying down
earlier this week one google engineer xe on the company xe internal message boards xe proposed the idea of employees protesting google cloud xe conference at the moscone center in san francisco in july with campaign called xe coccupy moscone center xe fashioned after the occupy wall street protests
that engineer resigned from the company this week in protest of maven and planned for friday to be his last day but he said he was told on friday morning to leave immediately according to an email viewed by the times
peter singer who studies war and technology at new america washington research group said many of the tools the pentagon was seeking were xe cneither inherently military nor inherently civilian xe he added xe cthis is not cannons and ballistic missiles xe the same software that speeds through video shot with armed drones can be used to study customers in fast food restaurants or movements on factory floor
mr singer also said he thought google employees who denounced maven were somewhat na xc xafve because google xe search engine and the video platform of its youtube division have been used for years by warriors of many countries as well as al qaeda and the islamic state
xe cthey may want to act like they xe re not in the business of war but the business of war long ago came to them xe said mr singer author of book examining such issues called xe clikewar xe scheduled for publication in the fall

things we xe really like to know
for better and worse humans are only improving their ability to deceive themselves with technology
by cade metz
during the summer before the presidential election john seymour and philip tully two researchers with zerofox security company in baltimore unveiled new kind of twitter bot by analyzing patterns of activity on the social network the bot learned to fool users into clicking on links in tweets that led to potentially hazardous sites
the bot called snap was an automated xe cphishing xe system capable of homing in on the whims of specific individuals and coaxing them toward that moment when they would inadvertently download spyware onto their machines xe carchaeologists believe they xe ve found the tomb of alexander the great is in the for the first time goo gl kjdqyt xe the bot tweeted at one unsuspecting user
even with the odd grammatical misstep snap succeeded in eliciting click as often as percent of the time on par with human hackers who craft phishing messages by hand
like the science times page on facebook sign up for the science times newsletter
the bot was unarmed merely proof of concept but in the wake of the election and the wave of concern over political hacking fake news and the dark side of social networking it illustrated why the landscape of fakery will only darken further
the two researchers built what is called neural network complex mathematical system that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data
neural network can learn to recognize dog by gleaning patterns from thousands of dog photos it can learn to identify spoken words by sifting through old tech support calls
and as the two researchers showed neural network can learn to write phishing messages by inspecting tweets reddit posts and previous online hacks
today the same mathematical technique is infusing machines with wide range of humanlike powers from speech recognition to language translation in many cases this new breed of artificial intelligence is also an ideal means of deceiving large numbers of people over the internet mass manipulation is about to get whole lot easier
and few we xe rather not discuss
xe cit would be very surprising if things don xe go this way xe said shahar avin researcher at the center for the study of existential risk at the university of cambridge xe call the trends point in that direction xe
many technology observers have expressed concerns at the rise of that generates deepfakes xe fake images that look like the real thing what began as way of putting anyone xe head onto the shoulders of porn star has evolved into tool for seamlessly putting any image or audio into any video
in april buzzfeed and comedian jordan peele released video that put words including xe cwe need to be more vigilant with what we trust from the internet xe into the mouth of barack obama
the threat will only expand as researchers develop systems that can metabolize and learn from increasingly large collections of data neural networks can generate believable sounds as well as images this is what enables digital assistants such as apple siri to sound more human than they did in years past
google has built system called duplex that can phone local restaurant make reservations and fool the person on the other end of the line into thinking the caller is real person the service is expected to reach smartphones before the end of the year
experts have long had the power to doctor audio and video but as these systems improve it will become easier and cheaper for anyone to generate items of digital content xe images videos social interactions xe that look and sound like the real thing
inspired by the culture of academia the top labs and even giant public companies such as google openly publish their research and in many cases their software code
with these techniques machines are also learning to read and write for years experts questioned whether neural networks could crack the code of natural language but the tide has shifted in recent months
organizations such as google and openai an independent lab in san francisco have built systems that learn the vagaries of language at the broadest scales xe analyzing everything from wikipedia articles to self published romance novels xe before applying the knowledge to specific tasks the systems can read paragraph and answer questions about it they can judge whether movie review is positive or negative
this technology could improve phishing bots such as snap today most twitter bots seem like bots especially when you start replying to them in the future they will respond in kind
the technology also could lead to the creation of voice bots that can carry on decent conversation xe and no doubt one day will call and persuade you to divulge your credit card information
these new language systems are driven by new wave of computing power google engineers have designed computer chips specifically for training neural networks other companies are building similar chips and as these arrive they will accelerate research even further
jack clark head of policy at openai can see not too distant future in which governments create machine learning systems that attempt to radicalize populations in other countries or force views onto their own people
xe cthis is new kind of societal control or propaganda xe he said xe cgovernments can start to create campaigns that target individuals but at the same time operate across many people in parallel with larger objective xe
ideally artificial intelligence could also provide ways of identifying and stopping this kind of mass manipulation mark zuckerberg likes to talk about the possibilities but for the foreseeable future we face machine learning arms race
consider generative adversarial networks or gans these are pair of neural network systems that can automatically generate convincing images or manipulate existing ones
they do this by playing kind of cat and mouse game the first network makes millions of tiny changes to an image xe snow gets added to summery street scenes grizzlies transform into pandas fake faces look so convincing that viewers mistake them for celebrities xe in an effort to fool the second network
the second network does its best not to be fooled as the pair battle the image only gets more convincing xe the trying to detect fakery always loses
detecting fake news is even harder humans can barely agree on what counts as fake news how can we expect machine to do so and if it could would we want it to
perhaps the only way to stop misinformation is to somehow teach people to view what they see online with extreme distrust but that may be the hardest fix of them all
xe cwe can deploy technology that patches our computer systems xe mr avin said xe cbut we cannot deploy patches to peoples xe heads xe

when ride sharing apps made their debut few years ago lots of people thought it was crazy to get in stranger xe car and now we all do it at without even thinking did you expect attitudes to change so quickly it definitely moved faster than think anyone xe including myself xe thought we knew that we would need to change people xe behavior it actually was one of the main reasons the original tagline was xe cyour friend with car xe
you xe ve been vocal about fighting climate change but studies have shown that lyft and uber pull people away from mass transit and carbon neutral options like biking or walking isn xe that at odds with helping the environment we xe ve seen studies that have shown both sides of this you know percent of people commute to work by car alone just half percent of all miles driven happen in lyft or uber but we want to be part of the solution the purpose of the effort we just announced xe buying carbon offsets for all lyft rides xe was not to say this is permanent solution but to say we xe re going to take action we care lot about this and we have more work to do
the internet made fun of lyft shuttle when it was announced because the service xe fixed route with predetermined stops xe sounds lot like bus why is it not bus well we weren xe claiming that we were coming up with like novel concept we were trying to do exactly what you asked about in the last question which is work to get more people to share the ride
lyft is investing heavily in developing self driving cars in fact you wrote on your blog that by majority of lyft rides will use autonomous vehicles is there any possibility that driverless cars are going to end up being like jet packs where years from now we xe ll be wondering xe cwhen are those going to happen xe no don xe think so this is real believe this will be the largest physical environment change that we witness in our lives our cities have been designed around car ownership and we actually will be able to change that and design cities for people
you think private car ownership is going to end at least in urban areas because using services like lyft will be cheaper and easier but elon musk has predicted that people will still buy cars and make money off them by allowing them to taxi other people around when not in use is it possible that he xe right and you xe re wrong don xe believe so from customer perspective you just want to get from point to and in the world he was describing who would be responsible for the cleaning or if someone left their bag in your car it xe going to be way more efficient for lyft to do all of the maintenance and cleaning and parking for you xe quite confident that car ownership will not make sense in the future
here xe one thing xe ve always wondered about driverless cars you have to enter destination but what if you don xe have destination say you xe re driving around your neighborhood searching for your lost dog or you just got dumped and you want to drive through the countryside and clear your head and contemplate the nature of love how does your driverless car get you around in that case think you xe have to have like contemplation mode and lost dog mode and guess those haven xe been thought about yet now xe ll contemplate them
have you ever taken an uber no don xe think so
would you ever take an uber think xe ll say the same thing don xe think so you xe re lost in the desert it xe day without food or water you xe ve been checking your lyft app xe there are no lyfts but you check uber and there xe one passing by are you going to take that uber don xe think so xe xa

rivendale farms outside pittsburgh is laboratory for applying technology to smaller farms
the milking machines cost about each credit credit ross mantle for the new york times

by steve lohr
bulger pa xe about jersey cows in the rolling terrain at rivendale farms in bulger some miles west of pittsburgh wear fitbit like collars that monitor their movement eating and rumination patterns they are milked not by humans but by robotic machines
nearby greenhouse about quarter acre in size and filled with salad bowl crops like kale arugula and baby carrots is automated the temperature humidity and sunlight are controlled by sensors and retractable metallic screens and soon small robots may roam the farm xe eight acres of vegetable crops outdoors to spot disease and pluck weeds
farming in america is increasingly high tech endeavor combines guided by gps drones satellite imagery soil sensors and supercomputers all help the nation xe food production yet that technology is mainly tailored for big industrial farms where fields stretch as far as the eye can see
rivendale farms which has just completed its first year of full operations offers glimpse of technology coming available for smaller farms
technology for giant farms is all about increasing yields and cutting costs for smaller farms too efficiency is paramount but technology can also eliminate lot of tedious routine labor xe lifestyle payoff that can help persuade younger generation to stay put on family farms rather than sell out
smaller farms typically raise specialty crops on limited acreage specialty farming requires scaled down approach like the small robots being developed for rivendale by scientists at nearby carnegie mellon university and the expanding array of equipment from the xe cslow tools xe movement group of farmers and engineers designing affordable tools for small farms
the goal at rivendale said thomas tull the farm xe owner is to create xe cboutique cutting edge farm enabled by technology that produces great food xe
rivendale can afford its combination of cutting edge commercial technology and science experiments because mr tull is billionaire serial entrepreneur investor in tech related ventures and former film producer he is also on the board of carnegie mellon he has spent several million dollars on rivendale so far but the plan mr tull said is for the farm to become self sustaining by
so rivendale can try more things at once than others can but its efforts experts say are part of broader trend among small farmers seeking to raise healthy food and livestock using less fossil fuel fertilizer and processed feed
xe cwe xe re seeing greater use of modern technology and tools in smaller soil based farming and that vision is being wholeheartedly embraced at rivendale xe said jack algiere farm director at stone barns center for food and agriculture nonprofit farm in pocantico hills that has been leading advocate for sustainable agriculture on small farms
mr tull bought the land in and construction started the next year it is now diversified operation with milking cows breeding cows vegetable crops corn for feed chickens even honeybees
rivendale including pasture land cover crops and woods spans acres farming in america has been consolidating for decades with the average size of farm being acres in according to government statistics and more than half of the value produced by the nation xe agricultural sector is generated by small fraction of very large farms acres on average
rivendale xe milk eggs and produce are sold to selected local restaurants and hotels it also supplies food to the pittsburgh pirates and the pittsburgh steelers in which mr tull is part owner
walk into the dairy barn at rivendale and there are no people xe only cows an automated feed system and three robotic milking machines
the rivendale cows are milked four times day on average when they feel ready compared with the traditional twice day regimen when humans manage the milking and its jersey cows produce percent more milk than the average for the breed with higher protein and butterfat content said christine grady general manager of rivendale
xe cthey eat when they want lie down when they want and feed when they want xe ms grady said xe cand happier cow produces more milk and better milk xe
it takes week or two for the cows to get accustomed to the robotic milkers and the built in incentives said rodney rankin who leads the dairy operations the milking stations have vanilla flavored feed pellets but cow cannot just come back repeatedly for the treats sensors and scale xe cow xe weight can vary by up to pounds in day xe prevent cows without reasonably full udders from getting in
once the cow is in the stall the teats and udder are washed with little rotary brushes lasers scan and guide the milk suction devices onto each of the four teats milking time is six minutes on average at the end the cow is sprayed with iodine and steam to clean its udder
robotic milkers have been available for years but the technology has steadily improved requiring far less human assistance than few years ago
the machines cost about each without them and an automated feeding system the milking barn at rivendale would require five workers instead of being mainly overseen by one ms grady said
the rivendale robotic milking machines are made by lely dutch company and leader in the industry in some european countries up to percent of the cows are milked by machine while in the united states the share is about percent estimates mathew haan dairy technology expert at pennsylvania state university xe agriculture extension program
the gap mr haan said is largely explained by more generous programs that support milk prices as well as higher labor costs than in america these two factors have encouraged investment in automation in europe
in the united states even large herd producers with thousands of cows in california which have been labor intensive operations are beginning to try robotic milking machines that is driven partly by changing immigration policies that may create shortage of farm workers but to date the main market has been smaller operations with to milking cows said steve fried lely xe north american sales manager
george kantor senior systems scientist at carnegie mellon xe robotics institute is leading the effort at rivendale to develop xe cscouting robots xe to identify disease and weeds in the vegetable field and then send smartphone alerts if there is problem
his team did field work and collected data in the fall then shifted to university lab for the winter computer vision and machine learning mr kantor said will be deployed to distinguish healthy plants from diseased ones and weeds
next step would be to get rid of weeds organic farming avoids pesticides and digging up or pulling weeds mr kantor said would require hand like grasping and holding more daunting robotic task where progress has been slower
some technology at rivendale is more neat hack than high tech susanna meyer the head of crop production is fond of greens cutter whose engine is battery powered electric drill and small electric tiller called the tillie xe one of the slow tools implements
michael mcgowen former staff scientist at los alamos national laboratory bought farm in oregon decade ago started growing vegetables and found there were no affordable tools for small farms so he designed his own including the tillie whose basic model sells for and set up business carts and tools in corvallis ore
johnny xe selected seeds leading distributor of the small scale farming tools has seen that business increase fivefold over the last years said adam lemieux the company xe product manager for tools and supplies
to most longtime farmers stands for artificial insemination not digital wizardry but new generation of family farmers is welcoming robotic assistants and smartphone apps
xe cthey have different mind set and they are all trying to figure out path ahead for their family farms and where technology fits in xe said jeff ainslie vice president of red barn consulting which advises family farmers
scott flory is one of them after earning his degree in dairy science from virginia tech mr flory returned to his family farm in dublin va in with ideas for modernizing its operations
since then the farm has installed four of the lely robotic milkers equipped the cows with activity trackers and doubled the number of its milking cows to without adding workers the farm remains almost entirely family affair run by him his wife laura and his parents dale and janet
xe ci wouldn xe be in the dairy business today without this stuff xe said mr flory who is
at rivendale mr tull the owner has no doubt that advancing technology will transform smaller farms someday
but after closely observing the operations at rivendale this past year he said xe cyou come away with tremendous respect for farmers and that the work is hard and complex the key is getting the right mix of art and science xe

what to do when we don xe know what to do
by dhruv khullar
my patient and were locked in game of decision making hot potato
xe cwhat would you do doc xe he said we xe been discussing whether he should get screened for prostate cancer
such questions trouble most doctors we often lob the choice back to patients or xe con the one hand on the other hand xe so much that they start sympathizing with harry truman who reportedly joked he wished for one handed advisers
but the evidence wasn xe clear passed the potato back
medicine xe decades long march toward patient autonomy means patients are often now asked to make the hard decisions xe to weigh trade offs to grapple with how their values suggest one path over another this is particularly true when medical science doesn xe offer clear answer doctors encourage patients to decide where evidence is weak while making strong recommendations when evidence is robust but should we be doing the opposite
research suggests that physicians xe recommendations powerfully influence how patients weigh their choices and that while almost all patients want to know their options most want their doctor to make the final decision the greater the uncertainty the more support they want xe but the less likely they are to receive it
xe cwithout good evidence doctors say xe you decide xe xe dr terri fried professor of medicine at yale and geriatrician at the va connecticut healthcare system told me xe cpatients have no idea what to do with that if we as doctors can xe reason through the decision how in the world can we expect patients to xe
doctors could be more aware of how their language affects patients it xe easier for patients to understand absolute risks than relative risks that treatment reduces your risk to percent from percent instead of by percent patients are more sensitive to harms than benefits but doctors tend to dwell on the upside presenting choices sequentially instead of all at once seems to improve comprehension and patients feel more confident in doctors who offer rationale for uncertainty xe describing the possible diagnoses even if the right one is unclear xe than when they simply acknowledge it without explanation
people in general are not great at evaluating risk they worry more about shark attacks than car crashes
patients and doctors contend with two major forms of uncertainty uncertainty of evidence and uncertainty of outcome
uncertainty of evidence is an information problem it xe like putting quarter into gumball machine and having no idea how many will come out maybe there aren xe good clinical trials maybe there are trials but they don xe include patients like you maybe they do include patients like you but not while you xe re fighting pneumonia
uncertainty of outcome is prediction problem we know five gumballs are coming out we just don xe know which ones let xe say percent of patients like you will have stroke this year are you the percent or the percent
xe cmost clinicians want much more guidance especially on how to communicate uncertainty without seeming like they don xe know what they xe re doing xe said dr mary politi an associate professor at the washington university school of medicine xe cthey feel comfortable talking about benefits but not risks patients feel misled when bad things happen xe
doctors typically recommend for or against treatment by dividing continuum of risk into categories that trip switch statin when you reach percent risk of heart attack blood thinner when you xe re at percent risk of stroke
we xe re less well trained to explore how patient xe fears and values intersect with the available evidence maybe the inconvenience of daily pills makes percent risk of heart attack acceptable to one patient while loved one xe recent illness makes percent risk of stroke unacceptable to another
in many cases patient preferences diverge substantially from guideline recommendations which are created by researchers and policymakers with little input from patients on where to draw the line of acceptable risk but it xe in using these guidelines that doctors make their strongest recommendations while shying away from decisions where evidence is limited and where their clinical experience and intuition may be most valuable
xe cit xe exactly when we xe re most sure that we should be most cautious xe dr fried said xe cin our enthusiasm for guidelines we overlook whether treatment is actually in line with patient xe goals xe
it xe easy to assume that innovations like machine learning and precision medicine will reduce uncertainty but medical advances often generate more uncertainty not less increasingly sophisticated imaging means we pick up more growths more powerful lab tests uncover hidden xe and possibly irrelevant xe irregularities when should we poke and prod when should we watch and wait as procedures become less invasive more patients can get them we can put stents in many more people than we can subject to open heart surgery but should we
how can we help patients navigate the gray space
decision aids and risk pictographs can help patients better understand their values and their choices but they xe re available only for select conditions and more useful for uncertainty of outcome than uncertainty of evidence you have to know roughly how many gumballs are coming out
broader approach involves helping patients systematically identify what xe important to them and based on these goals and preferences suggesting to them how to think about their options program at the university of california san francisco for example coaches patients through decision making process known as scoped situation choices objectives people evaluation and decisions walking patients through each of these considerations can improve patient knowledge and satisfaction and reduce anxiety and regret
patients need to understand their values but also their possible futures xe which is where clinicians xe experience and guidance may be most valuable other industries sometimes use technique known as scenario planning to prepare people for uncertain outcomes and some argue this approach could be used in medicine as well the idea is not to reduce uncertainty but to help patients clearly envision what life would look like in one outcome versus another and to better prepare them for the various futures that might unfold
training doctors to accept and convey uncertainty may also be needed doctors uncomfortable with uncertainty are more likely to experience work related stress withhold information from patients and order more tests procedures and referrals there xe currently wide variation in what doctors believe their role should be when communicating uncertainty and little instruction in how to do so
what xe certain is that uncertainty will always be with us when wading through medicine xe expansive gray zones patients could use guide will they get one

washington xe president trump is confident that the united states is winning its trade war with china but on both sides of the pacific bleaker recognition is taking hold the world xe two largest economies are in the opening stages of new economic cold war one that could persist well after mr trump is out of office
xe cthis thing will last long xe jack ma the billionaire chairman of alibaba group warned meeting of investors on tuesday in hangzhou china xe cif you want short term solution there is no solution xe
mr trump intensified his trade fight this week imposing tariffs on billion worth of chinese goods and threatening to tax nearly all imports from china if it dared to retaliate his position has bewildered frustrated and provoked beijing which has responded with its own levies on american goods
the diplomatic stalemate has many in the business and policy communities considering the possibility that the united states may be in protracted and economically damaging trade fight for years to come and wondering what if anything america will gain
kevin rudd former prime minister of australia and an expert on china said in an interview that signaled xe cthe beginnings of war of different type trade war an investment war and technology war between the two great powers of the st century with an uncertain landing point xe
signs of fallout were already apparent mr ma backed off pledge he had made in meeting with mr trump last year to create one million jobs in the united states telling the chinese news site xinhua that xe cthe promise was made on the premise of friendly china partnership and rational trade relations xe premise he said no longer exists xe ctrade is not weapon xe he said
the latest tit for tat leaves little room for concessions at least in the interim as both countries dig in their heels and china tries to remain strong despite an economic softening that mr trump clearly sees as an opening to force beijing xe hand
chinese growth in investment factory production and consumer spending have all slowed this year and its economic growth has slowed alongside the situation is expected to worsen as effects of the escalating american tariffs ramp up
while the united states made overtures toward china in recent days to talk trade in washington this month some officials said they now doubted beijing would engage again at high level until after the midterm elections in november when president xi jinping may meet mr trump on the sidelines of an economic summit meeting in buenos aires
mr trump himself seemed to dangle the prospect that he and he alone could broker resolution that threatened to cause economic pain to companies and consumers on both sides of the pacific
xe chopefully this trade situation will be resolved in the end by myself and president xi of china for whom have great respect and affection xe mr trump said in his statement announcing the tariffs
yet it is not clear that either side will see reason to back down aides to mr trump say the president believes that the united states has the upper hand on china with an ability to impose tariffs on far larger number of goods than the chinese can match given that america imports far more than it exports and while the tariffs are unpopular with republican lawmakers farmers and manufacturers his trade approach remains popular with his political base
the chinese side has its own political reasons to avoid capitulation acceding to mr trump would be considered sign of weakness for mr xi according to analysts
and they see no sign that china is willing to give up on made in china an industrial program that aims for dominance in robotics artificial intelligence and other high tech industries that have been the domain of the united states and europe and that mr trump has identified as policy initiative that must be stopped
while chinese officials have expressed willingness to get rid of the name made in china they have been much more cautious about accepting limits on some of the crucial features of the country xe industrial policy like big loans from state owned banks at very low interest rates to favored industries
inside the white house there remains pitched battle between those who want to make deal with beijing and those who are determined to keep piling on pressure to force more radical change in its trade practices at the moment the hard liners have mr trump xe ear
xe cyou would expect the administration to have tabled negotiating text with clear set of commitments but that has apparently not been done xe said daniel price former trade adviser to president george bush xe cthere are some in the administration who see tariffs as an end in themselves xe
mr price said the trump administration had done good job of cataloging china xe abuses theft of intellectual property forced transfer of technology from foreign companies predatory joint venture agreements but it has failed to marshal coalition to confront china instead provoking separate trade fights with the european union japan canada and mexico by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum and threatening additional taxes on imported cars
keith bradsher our shanghai bureau chief answers questions on the trade war and the global economy on facebook live
xe cdoing this without the and japan fully on board as though chinese unfair trade practices were only bilateral problem is wrongheaded and certainly less effective xe he said xe cbut it xe very hard to galvanize your allies when you impose steel and aluminum tariffs on them and threaten auto tariffs xe
for china complicating factor is figuring out who has influence in mr trump xe white house treasury secretary steven mnuchin who has been leading the negotiations invited china xe top trade negotiator liu he to washington for meeting next week even though his last visit ended badly when mr trump spurned deal that would have cut the american trade deficit with china
mr mnuchin believes the united states must be open to talks as long as china is willing to address structural issues including the trade gap between what america exports and what it imports pressure on american companies to hand over valuable technology as condition for doing business in china and intellectual property theft
other senior officials notably peter navarro who oversees the office of trade and manufacturing policy have told colleagues that inviting the chinese now was sign of weakness mr navarro an economist who made his name with book titles like xe cdeath by china xe is among those who favor putting more pressure on china to force change in its behavior
his office produced compendious report in june called xe chow china xe economic aggression threatens the technologies and intellectual property of the united states and the world xe in early may he and mr mnuchin clashed openly during visit to beijing after mr mnuchin excluded him and other american officials from private meeting with mr liu
it is not clear whether mr liu will visit washington next week but even if he does people who have spoken to chinese officials said the unraveling of the agreement mr liu believed he had struck on his last visit would make him reluctant to make any deal this time
xe cthe chinese deep learning from that is xe we should not substantively re engage until the administration has its internal house in order xe xe said mr rudd who is now the president of the asia society policy institute
after months of bruising encounters with mr trump mr rudd said chinese officials recognized that they would need to change their policies on trade and market access but he said mr xi was no less likely than mr trump to risk losing face by giving in to american pressure
xe cchina has politics too xe he said xe cthe whole notion of xe back down xe and xe face xe is as live consideration within internal chinese politics as it is within politics xe
mr trump xe aggressive moves drew intense criticism from some quarters at home fred smith the chief executive of fedex and an enthusiastic supporter of the president xe tax cuts called his trade policy form of mercantilism that was xe cworrisome to everyone xe
but mr trump has shown little sign of changing course while there are differences among members of his economic team there is broad consensus in the administration about taking hawkish stance toward china some point to evidence that the trade pressure on china was making it less adventurous in the east china sea where it spars regularly with japan
mr trump has forged ahead with tariffs even while saying that the trade tensions were making china less cooperative in pressuring north korea on its nuclear arsenal xe claim that puzzles some of his own advisers
xe cthey have been helpful hope they xe re still helpful xe mr trump said at news conference tuesday with the polish president andrzej duda xe cthere xe question about that xe
but the president added xe cit got to point where the numbers were too big xe china xe crebuilt their country with tremendous amounts of money pouring out of the united states xe he said xe cand xe ve changed that around xe

san francisco xe pairing artificial intelligence and the blockchain might be what you would expect from scammer looking to make quick buck in
the two concepts after all are two of the most buzzed about and least understood ideas in the tech universe
and the blockchain the database design introduced by bitcoin has lately been the most popular route for anyone looking to raise money for an idea that sounds too good to be true
despite how easy the combination is to mock the idea of applying the blockchain to artificial intelligence is attracting growing roster of serious entrepreneurs and venture capitalists many of them with impressive academic credentials
dawn song computer science professor at the university of california and ben goertzel the chief scientist at hanson robotics have been among the big names arguing that the blockchain could be crucial way to push back against some of the most worrying trends facing the field of artificial intelligence
many experts are concerned that facebook google and few other big companies are hoarding talent in the field the internet giants also control the massive troves of online data that are necessary to train and refine the best machine learning programs
professor song dr goertzel and other entrepreneurs say they believe the blockchain could encourage broader distribution of the data and algorithms that will determine the future development of artificial intelligence
xe cit xe important to have machine learning capabilities that are more under the user xe control rather than relying on these big companies to get access to these capabilities xe professor song said in an interview
the start ups working toward this goal are applying blockchains in number of ways at the most basic level just as the blockchain allows money to be moved around without any bank or central authority in the middle artificial intelligence experts are hoping that blockchain can allow artificial intelligence networks to access large stores of data without any big company in control of the data or the algorithms
several start ups are setting up blockchain based marketplaces where people can buy and sell data
ocean protocol project based in berlin is building the infrastructure so that anyone can set up marketplace for any kind of data with the users of data paying the sources with digital tokens
unlike google and facebook which store the data they get from users the marketplaces built on ocean protocol will not have the data themselves they will just be places for people with data to meet ensuring that no central player can access or exploit the data
xe cblockchains are incentive machines xe you can get people to do stuff by paying them xe said trent mcconaghy one of the founders of ocean protocol who has been working in artificial intelligence since the
the goal mr mcconaghy said is to xe cdecentralize access to data before it xe too late xe
ocean is working with several automakers to collect data from cars to help create the artificial intelligence of autonomous cars all the automakers are expected to share data so none of them have monopoly over it
another start up revel will pay people to collect the data that companies are looking for like pictures of taxis or recordings of particular language users can also let their phones and computers be used to process and categorize the images and sounds xe all in exchange for digital tokens over thousand people already have put their computers to work
these sorts of marketplaces are only the outer layer of the blockchain based systems that are being built to handle artificial intelligence data
one of the biggest concerns that people have about the data being collected by google and facebook is the access it gives these companies to the most private details of our lives
professor song is working on blockchain known as oasis that will use advanced techniques to secure the data being bought and sold so that no one xe not even the company using the data xe will get copy of it
in the oasis network all data moving through the system will be locked into encrypted bundles researchers will be able to run the data through their machine learning algorithms xe and prove that the calculations were done correctly xe without ever actually seeing the underlying data
one project building on top of oasis known as kara will allow medical researchers looking at the behavior of specific diseases to train their machine learning models with data from actual patients without the data ever being exposed
oasis has already raised million from several big name venture capital firms but they have competition from another start up created by researchers from the massachusetts institute of technology called enigma
enigma got started before oasis and is working with partners like ocean protocol to ensure that people contributing data to marketplaces can set the exact terms under which their data can be used
other start ups are using blockchains to open access to the artificial intelligence models themselves dr goertzel has created singularitynet blockchain that will serve as link among services around the world if one artificial intelligence module is unable to come up with an answer it can consult with others and provide compensation if one of the other modules is able to get it right
xe cit lets you have network of that nobody owns xe dr goertzel said
hanson robotics is planning to use singularitynet to feed information into its humanoid robot sophia unlike amazon xe alexa service which answers questions using services approved by amazon dr goertzel wants sophia to reach out to other artificial intelligence providers if she can xe find the right answer
xe cwe are now using singularitynet to upgrade sophia xe intelligence xe dr goertzel said xe cin principle it is much more flexible because we don xe have centrally controlled market xe
as with most blockchain applications lot of technical work still must be done before these new systems can take off xe and it is not clear that all of the roadblocks are surmountable fred ehrsam the co founder of the cryptocurrency exchange coinbase is investing in the area but he says he believes it will take some time before these systems can prove themselves he is hopeful that when they do they will play an important role in democratizing the industry
xe cright now the data isn xe really being valued in an open market it xe just being given to few companies xe mr ehrsam said xe cwhat if there was now free market for data xe
